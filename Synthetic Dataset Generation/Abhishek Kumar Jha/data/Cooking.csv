Is there anything special to know before using powdered vanilla?,"<p>Is there anything special to know before using powdered vanilla?  I use the liquid vanilla extract quite a bit in making a lot of things, especially chocolate and key lime puddings but am looking for alcohol free and organic form. It sounds like the powdered form provides a stronger flavor which sounds good to me.
Thank you for being there.  This is a tremendous offering for people who want to create great foods...</p>

canning pickles,"<p>I canned a bushel of pickles 2 weeks ago.  When I finished up that morning,  all the jars were sealed.  This morning I noticed that about a dozen jars were not sealed.  Just the opposite.  The lids were puckering out to the point of bulging the lids out.  I have been canning for more than ten years and I have never seen this before.  What would cause this and are they safe?</p>
",73519,28-08-2016 16:14,Why are my canning lids popped out?,"<p>My wife has been trying to can some foods using the canning techniques that she's familiar with from Romania, but with the American-style canning jars and lids that we get here. This involves packing the jar with the canned goods, filling the jar with boiled brine to near the top, and then manually closing the lid. The jars are <em>not</em> immersed in boiling water with their lids on, as is recommended by most American canning guides.</p>

<ol>
<li>Is this technique safe? Why do American canning guides insist on boiling the jar after it's closed?</li>
<li>Several of our jars, after cooling, have the lids popped out and slightly convex rather than concave. Is this a problem? What causes this?</li>

"Basil wilting, how to preserve?","<p>I have a hard time keeping basil.</p>

<p>When I buy it from a local grocery store, it is perfectly fresh, but when I take it home it withers in a couple of days.</p>

blood in cooked chicken,"<p>I roasted a chicken at 180 using the fan for 1 1/2 hours, when I got it out of the oven, I pierced it and the juices were clear, I ate some slices of the breast, and the first ones looked fine, but a later one had blood or what looked like blood in it, will I be ok or do I need a doctor?</p>
",75083,28-10-2016 17:49,"Is ""until juices run clear"" a valid test for poultry doneness? Why or why not?","<p>I've come across this particular recommendation many times in <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/roastturkeywithbread_87596"">various recipes</a> and cookbooks and probably even given it out myself once or twice.  Poultry is sufficiently cooked when the juices run clear, not red or pink.</p>

<p>In recent months and years, as I've grown more interested in and knowledgeable about the science of cooking, I've learned to be skeptical of such simplistic claims.  This one is repeated <em>everywhere</em> - even the <a href=""http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/public/pub/foodsafe/foodhandl.html"">Ontario Ministry of Health</a> says it - but I've also run across various <a href=""http://www.foodpoisonjournal.com/2009/07/articles/food-poisoning-watch/cook-until-juices-run-clear-is-bad-food-safety-advice/"">claims that it is dangerous advice</a>.</p>

<p>What I'd like to know is this:</p>

<p><strong>What does it <em>actually</em> mean - chemically or biologically speaking - when poultry juices run clear?  Is it actually a reliable indicator that the food is safe to eat?</strong></p>

<p>P.S. I am quite well aware that the way one is <em>supposed</em> to test for doneness is to use a thermometer and ensure that the internal temperature has reached 165° F / 74° C.  I always do this, but thermometers can break, run out of battery, etc., so I think it is still helpful to know if the juice test is ever a viable alternative.  But most importantly I am interested in understanding <em>what is happening</em> to the meat that causes the juices to change colour, and under what other conditions this can happen.</p>

Sous vide effectiveness without using a vacuum sealer?,"<p>I frequently use the water displacement method to seal ziploc freezer bags when I sous vide. I can get maybe 99% of the air out, but technically the bag is not under vacuum. If I clip the top of the bag to the side of my container, any air pockets that emerge collects at the top, and the meat is entirely in contact with the bag and immersion bath. Alternatively, if I seal the bag with a marinade, there are no pockets of air between the meat and the immersion bath. </p>

<p>I can't imagine that the temperature transfer can be any more effective when vacuum sealed. So why does a site like SeriousEats still suggest that a vacuum sealer is needed for best results with longer cooking times?  </p>

<p><strong>update</strong> from <a href=""http://www.seriouseats.com/2016/08/how-to-seal-food-airtight-without-vacuum-sealer-water-displacement-method.html#comments-299859"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.seriouseats.com/2016/08/how-to-seal-food-airtight-without-vacuum-sealer-water-displacement-method.html#comments-299859</a></p>

<p>In the context of <strong>food storage in plastic bags</strong>, SeriousEats claims, ""excess air causes oxidation that can develop into off flavors or promote spoilage."" But I never sous vide for the freezer, it gets served when done. </p>

<p>There was a comment that asked if food contamination might occur for cooking times longer than 48 hours, but it was never answered. </p>

<p>What is the science behind this statement? How much residual air is ""too much""? </p>

<p>If the bag remains submerged, does not leak, and the food in full contact with the water bath, is that enough to duplicate the benefits of a true vacuum seal?</p>

<p><strong>update 2</strong></p>

<p>Also, what is the scientific impact of trapping small amounts of residual air in a pocket above the water bath?  This assumes that there is still a very strong thermal coupling between the water bath and sous vide item. </p>

<p>In the photo below, you can see at least a 2inch gap between the air pockets above water level and the actual short ribs. From a heat transfer perspective, I can't imagine that a vacuum sealed bag can perform significantly better—certainly not relative to a 48hr cook time. Is there a possibility of bacterial contamination? </p>

Does room temperature affect rising time for bread dough?,"<p>I've tried a couple different kinds of basic bread recipes (both active dry and instant yeast) and no matter how closely to the letter I follow the recipe, I can't seem to get the dough to rise in the time suggested in the recipe. It takes so much longer and I fear the longer rise time makes changes the taste of the bread (and serves as an I convenience to my timing, though I guess that's slightly less important). I'm starting to wonder if my room temperature might be slowing down the rise time? My house this time of year is usually mid to high 70's and I will try to put the dough in sunlight if it's shining that day. </p>

<p>Any thoughts on what I'm doing wrong and how I can help my dough rise quicker?</p>

<p>Edit:
Ok, after attempting the suggestions in the answer below, I still cannot get my bread to rise. This is an oatmeal sandwich loaf which I was able to get a great 1st rise (doubled in bulk after 2 hours sitting in the sun), but the second is taking longer. After 2 hours, this is the best I got:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/C8go7.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/C8go7.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rf6u3.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rf6u3.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Not to mention that I suck at kneading because I can never get the dough smooth. These both have visible folds on the top which will inevitably burn in the oven... When I leave the dough for the 1st rise, I spray the top with oil to hold in the moisture and cover with a lint-free linen. But when I split the dough and press the gases out, the top is always a bit dried out and slightly hardened. This makes forming it into loaves difficult and leaves this fold on top. I am told that handling it too much after the first rise is not good and will make the 2nd rise take that much longer. Maybe I'm wrong a out that? </p>

<p>Warm equipment, super warm day today (80+ degrees and super sunny), I did use sugar and butter and allowed for a longer rise. This recipe called for 1tbs instant yeast and I even threw in an extra 1/4tbs for good measure. I made sure the salt and yeast were not mixed in together. But I just can't seem to make my breads light and fluffy. They are always small and dense. What gives? I'm so frustrated :(</p>
",90148,03-06-2018 22:16,How warm must dough be in order to rise?,"<p>While making some focaccia this afternoon, my wife said, ""sure the house is 'warm'; it'll be fine."" One hour later, no rising. It may be worth noting that our house is 66F. So we stuck it in a warm oven and it rose just fine. It turned out fine, I'm just glad we weren't trying to get it done for a meal. </p>

<p>So the question is, how warm does dough need to be to rise properly?</p>

"Garlic: minced, crushed, chopped, sliced. When to use each one, and what is the difference?","<p>I’ve seen, in many recipes, that the usage of garlic varies a lot.</p>

<p>For example: Meaty sauces normally require that the garlic is chopped and fried before the meat is added.</p>

Worms in salmon,"<p>I bought fresh wild salmon today and when I got it home there was a tiny, live worm clinging to the plastic wrap inside. I overcooked it to 200 degrees Fahrenheit. So that should be enough. My friend said not to eat it as worms are a sign it's bad. It wasn't firm, it was a bit squishy like frozen fish even though it was fresh. The best before date is three days from now and it smelled fine (although I got the raw fish on my lip).</p>

On the topic of eating raw fish and sashimi,"<p>So it has been widely accepted that raw fish or ""Sushi-graded"" fish must be frozen below $-37C$ for a certain period before they can be defrosted and eaten raw.

Cooking Small White Navy's giving me issues,"<p>how long must I cook small white navy beans in my soup to get soft?  Seems like it is taking too long. So far I have cooked 4 hours! </p>
",96165,05-02-2019 18:21,Baked beans still firm after soaking and hours of cooking,"<p>I decided I would make baked beans for a BBQ at my MIL's this past weekend. I've never made baked beans but decided that it was time since I love them so much! I found a recipe for Southern Baked Beans (using Navy beans). It was from a food blog. </p>

<p>During the description/commentary of the dish the blogger said they could be made with dried beans but she uses canned to save time. The recipe only mentioned canned beans. I couldn't find anything to tell me the ratio canned:dried beans so I decide a 1:1 ratio would be good. After putting a 24oz bag of beans in a cake pan (the recipe called for 32oz canned beans), I decided that was A LOT of beans so didn't add the remaining 8oz. I rinsed them first then soaked them for 15-18 hours. I rinsed them again and put them in a pot with the rest of the ingredients. </p>

<p>The recipe said to bake them at 350 for about 40 minutes and they should be done. After an hour and a temperature increase to 400, the beans weren't anywhere close to being done. At this point I decided they were probably very old beans. :( I moved them to the stove after another 30 minutes. They boiled on the stove for another 1 1/2 hours and were still rock hard (I kept adding water so they wouldn't boil dry - and this was on medium to medium-low heat). </p>

<p>We left the beans at my MIL's and she cooked them ""off and on"" (her words) the next day and declared they were done. They are not done. :(</p>

<p>Now that they've been cooked then refrigerated then cooked then refrigerated again, can I attempt to salvage them? I've read that adding 1/8 tsp baking soda per cup of beans will soften them. Is it too late to try this - add the beans, more water, and a small amount of baking soda and cook them a little more? I've put so much effort into these stupid beans I can't just give up! LOL</p>

Seasoning refuses to stick to carbon steel pan. Tried various techniques,"<p>Please before you mark this as a dupe, I did refer to this s<a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/54642/how-to-maintain-a-smooth-seasoning-on-carbon-steel-skillets"">tackexchange question</a>.</p>

<p>I have a Matfer carbon steel that won't hold seasoning at all.</p>

<p>I first attempted the Cooks Illustrated <a href=""https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/5820-the-ultimate-way-to-season-cast-iron?token=5df17ca23e364ba0a3b659d1ae7ae376"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">flaxseed oil technique</a>.</p>

<p>I was very careful to follow the instructions carefully.     I got a nice root-beer colored seasoning that looked tough but food stuck to it like there was no seasoning at all and it came right off.</p>

<p>I redid this several times, each time I:</p>

<ul>
<li>made sure each coat was very very very thin, wiped all but the sheen off</li>
<li>baked the pan for a full hour each coat at 500F with full hour cool-down</li>
<li>ensured each coat was not tacky</li>
<li>applied 5 to 10 coats</li>
<li>used very fresh pure flaxseed oil</li>
<li>Completely cleaned the pan of seasoning between attempts with ovencleaner and scotchbrite</li>
</ul>

<p>All very time consuming and ultimately ended in failure.</p>

<p>I also referred to <a href=""http://sherylcanter.com/wordpress/2010/01/a-science-based-technique-for-seasoning-cast-iron/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a> and followed the tips there.</p>

<p>I additionally followed everything on this <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/54642/how-to-maintain-a-smooth-seasoning-on-carbon-steel-skillets"">stackexchange</a> article.</p>

<p>I just can't get this to work.   I also tried a traditional seasoning.   That doesn't stay either.</p>

<p>I use wooden utensils.   The food just sticks and pulls the seasoning right off. I don't ever wash the pan.</p>

<p>One other thing I've noticed - on subsequent seasonings, no matter how thin I have the flaxseed oil on the pan, at the end of a baking cycle, it appears to pull together into little droplets.   Even with the oil practically wiped off the pan with just a nanometer thick coating.   I'm wondering if the oven cleaner messed up the pan or something.  It didn't do this when I first had the pan (though the seasoning still was a failure)</p>

<p>Any ideas?   I'm about ready to send this pan to goodwill.   </p>

<p>Note I have no problem keeping seasoning on a lodge cast iron pan.</p>
",74205,24-09-2016 15:47,How to maintain a smooth seasoning on carbon steel skillets?,"<p>I have two carbon steel skillets from De Buyer. They are no stainless steel skillets so I have to season them. I did this with the flaxseed oil method (apply a thin coat of oil, then eat on the stove burner (not oven for me) until it smokes a lot. Wait and redo it 5-6 times.)</p>

<p>Just after seasoning my skillets are perfect (black and with a smooth surface). But when I start cooking a steak, the seasoning is deteriorating. Indeed, I use to add some olive oil before my meat. In the part of the pan where there is no meat, the olive oil polymerizes and create some ugly and sticky bubbles. I cannot remove these hard oil bubbles when cleaning with salt and hot water. </p>

<p>So, every time I cook something with requires high heat (like steak), the oil I added just before the food is polymerizing and ruins my smooth seasoning. On my older skillet, the surface is no smooth at all anymore.</p>

(I used to get them at Morrocan stores,<br>

<p>I've never quite understood the need for such excessive salting when making preserved lemons. They still ferment great at normal levels of salt, and you then need to worry less about them being overly salty to use in future recipes. As far as I can tell it's solely from tradition.</p>
<p>Also, from checking out On Food and Cooking, it seems that McGee only points out that originally they are done with 5 to 10% salt content. I'm curious where you read/saw that he recommended such?</p>

How can I put grains in my bread?,"<p>OK. So I've learned how to make bread. Here is my technique:</p>

<p>Get unbleached, natural, unenriched flour.</p>

<p>Around 4 or 5 PM. Take a large bowl. Mix 3 cups of flour, 1 1/2 cups of water, a small amount of yeast (say, half of one of the ""Fleischmann's"" packets) and a pinch of salt. Cover with plastic wrap. The next day at 5am, warm oven to 450 F with (say) a casserole dish. Take the mixture out of the bowl and make it into a ball on floured paper. When the oven's hot, put the ball in the casserole dish and cover tightly with foil. After 30 mins remove the foil, give it another 10 minutes to crisp up.  Do this every day for a few weeks. I can make bread!  Result is fantastic.  I prefer a whole grain flour.</p>

<p>OK. So it's great to add either (a) raisins and/or (b) dark chocolate morsels in to the mix. (Seems to be no difference if you mix them through in the morning or at first.) The result is fantastic.</p>

<p>My question. I want to add in some ""grains"". I love heavy, ""German-style"" if you will, ""multigrain"" breads.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do I have to - say - cook - steam? - or something? Hammer? Air? Deep fry? ....  the ""grains"" first?  <em>Or do I just put them right in?</em> What's the deal on that?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there anything I should <em>particularly change</em> when throwing in grains? So, you experts may say something like: ""Everyone knows you then need much more yeast"" (just an example). Should I be aware of anything like that?</p></li>
<li><p>Should I mix them at first when I mix the flour/water, or only mix them through in the morning?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Are the ""grains"" in ""multigrain"" bread ""just sitting there"" - as if you'd scattered some diamonds through the bread, there's no chemical difference - or are they affecting the bread?  What's the deal?  How should I take my first step towards that ""heavy, multigrain"" feel?  Thx</p>

Chiffon Cake Problem,"<p>I would like to know what are the causes for a chiffon cake to have a caved in centre.</p>

<p>After baking, the cake turns out with a nice dome. The cake is overturned immediately to cool. But after about 15 minutes of cooling, the centre of the cake which was previously a dome became caved in (not too deeply caved in, maybe just about 2cm from the level of the cake height.)</p>

<p>So the result after the cake is cooled, the top of the cake (which was previously the bottom) is light and fluffy and the bottom of the cake (which was previously the top) is dense. </p>

<p>The sides and bottom of the cake are evenly browned. The sides do not shrink as much as the centre. </p>

<p>The cake is baked at 160C-Fan for 45min for a 5-egg recipe. I use cake flour and a very small amount of baking powder.</p>

Does the dish lose flavor when it releases a lot of smell?,"<p>If we taste with our smelling sense, and in the process of cooking aroma is being released into the air - does that mean that the more smell you fill your kitchen with, the more flavor you lose?</p>

<p>Is the iconic experience of aroma filled kitchen actually counterproductive to cooking flavorful food?</p>
",76415,13-12-2016 10:25,Is it true that smell is lost flavor?,"<p>This is a maxim that I hear frequently, especially as a defense of cooking methods that don't produce a lot of aroma: if the aroma is in the air, it means it's left the food.</p>

<p>As an example, some people complain about the lack of aroma produced in sous vide cooking, to which the sous vide advocates retort that this is evidence that more flavor is in the food.</p>

<p>Likewise, I recently saw <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgU-WycA54I"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Heston Blumenthal's roast chicken</a>, where he went for a low-and-slow approach that produces little aroma: here, too, he claimed the flavor-retention defense to its lack of appeal. ""Don't be disappointed, but my roasting technique doesn't flood your kitchen with good Sunday roast smells. This is a good thing, because smells are lost flavor"" he said, while ""SMELL = LOST FLAVOR"" popped up on the screen.</p>

How long does an opened and unrefrigerated tub of yogurt last?,"<p>I have found online that <strong>unopened</strong> and unrefrigerated yogurt will last for a few days without refrigeration. However, is this also true for <strong>opened</strong> and unrefrigerated yogurt? By ""opened"" I mean that I have already removed the seal and taken a few spoonfuls out of the tub before leaving it unrefrigerated. </p>

<p>EDIT: I see this question has been marked as duplicate. I think that the link provided does not answer my question. The case for yogurt is a very special one since it is a fermented food and cannot just be casually thrown into the general category of ""dairy product"" (as does the top answer in linked question). Moreover, my rough understanding is that yogurt has a low pH (from the high amounts of lactic acid) which prevents the growth of external pathogens. Hence, unopened yogurt will be safe at room temperature for at least a couple of days.  However, if you wish me to be pedantic, my question would be: is it likely that by opening the yogurt tub I introduced pathogens that can replicate rapidly at the low pH of yogurt given that it was left unrefrigerated?</p>

Does hard-boiling eggs in broth impact flavor?,"<p>I think the question says it all. I was looking at Marinated Soft Boiled Egg recipes for ramen and while trying them out I found it annoying to have a pot of boiling water for the eggs as well as a pot of simmering broth for the soup.</p>

",77620,20-01-2017 05:56,Difference between types of Thai black soy sauces (Healthy Boy brand),"<p>I've noticed that a lot of Thai dishes call for thick black soy sauce, but they rarely specify the type. Occasionally, a recipe will specify a certain brand, and sometimes they'll note if you should use the ""sweet"" (pad see ew, pad kee mao, etc.) or ""regular"" (pad ka prao, etc.).</p>

<p>When looking, I'll usually stick with Healthy Boy, since that seems to be the standard (and the most widely available in the US). When I get to the local Asian market, though, I'm confronted with about 5 or 6 types of Healthy Boy soy sauce, each of which says ""Black Soy Sauce.""</p>

<p>Within those, I've been able to narrow it down to three major types so far: </p>

<ul>
<li>Black Soy Sauce - Thick, salty, sweet, strong flavor</li>
<li>Sweet Black Soy Sauce - Thick, somewhat salty, very sweet, strong flavor. Not always labeled ""sweet""</li>
<li>Light/Thin Black Soy - Thinner consistency (similar to regular soy sauce). I have never tried this.</li>
</ul>

<p>While it's easy to tell the light from the others (just flip over the bottle), telling the difference between the sweet and regular is not always as easy. Thankfully, Healthy Boy color-codes the bottles. So far, I have seen:</p>

<ul>
<li>Light Orange (regular?)</li>
<li>Dark Orange (""stir fry seasoning with soy sauce?"")</li>
<li>Brown/brown-orange</li>
<li>Green (says Black Soy Sauce B, I think. High sugar content, mostly additive)</li>
<li>Red (sometimes says ""sweet"")</li>
<li>White (sometimes says ""sweet"")</li>
<li>Yellow - thin/light</li>
<li>Yellow - thick</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of those typically have varying sugar/salt contents, and have anywhere from 3 to 10 ingredients. Some are also labeled ""Natural Ferment"" (sub-questions: What does this mean? Does it matter?)</p>

<p>Just going by the bottle color, is there an easy way to tell the difference between all of these? Also, are certain colors more suited to certain dishes?</p>

<p>(I've also seen a couple Bronze and White that are mushroom and oytser flavored respectively, but this isn't about those ones.)</p>

Yoghurt making : effects of temperature and duration,"<p>As I am fairly new to making yoghurt at home I would like to understand the effects that temperatures and time have on the end product in both the initial heating/cooling step and the fermentation step.</p>

<p>So far I have made half a dozen 1.5 litre batches with three different cultures (currently using ABY-1 from CHR Hansen that I was able to buy from the Westcombe dairy in Somerset). I have a Luvelle machine that can ferment at 36C, 38C and 40C from 1 hour to 24 hours. </p>

<p>I want to understand what changes if I experiment with the following:-</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When I heat the milk to 85C and hold the temperature I have made some batches with a 10 minute hold and others with a 20 minute hold period and see/feel/taste no difference - will holding at 30 minutes produce a difference?</p></li>
<li><p>I am currently fermenting for 24 hours at 38C and getting a strong tang/sourness to the yoghurt but what would I expect to get if I reduced the fermentation to 12 hours at 38C...or less?</p></li>
<li><p>I choose 38C for the fermentation process because it was recommended by the manual that came with the Luvelle machine but what happens if I use 36C or 40C and what length of time would I use?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So generally speaking I want to know more about the initial heating process and what options there are and what the different fermentation temperatures and durations can have on the end results.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
",102265,11-09-2019 11:24,Controlling variables in homemade yogurt,"<p>Making yogurt at home is a fairly straight-forward process.  Heat milk to 180F (82C), cool that milk to at least 110F (43C), add live cultures, usually in the form of yogurt with said cultures, incubate, then chill. </p>

<p>There are several variables in the process, some of which are: The fat content of the milk (I typically use whole), how long to hold the milk during the initial heat step, how long it takes to cool the milk, the temperature of the incubation step, and the length of time for incubation, to name a few.</p>

A few layers of cheesecloth were placed on top to allow it to air, without letting anything else get into it.</p>

<p>When I recently opened it, I found a layer of what appears to be a yellow-orange mold on top.  There are also some small worms or maggots living on the top, but that doesn't seem as problematic to me.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sSUKN.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>As you can (sort of) see in this picture above, there is definitely a mother at the bottom.  The mother has grown since I last saw it.  I am not sure what to think about that top layer though.  Is the vinegar batch completely spoiled?</p>

Please clarify confusion between chillies and pepper?,"<p>Chili and pepper are not the same thing however people just refer to chilies as peppers interchangeably.</p>

<p>As far as I'm aware the difference is that peppers contain pipirine coming from the piper plant(such as black pepper, long pepper) whereas chillies contain capsaicin coming from capsicum plant and this is mutually exclusive.  </p>

<p>This scoville chart <a href=""https://www.pinterest.com/pin/148196643973566417/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.pinterest.com/pin/148196643973566417/</a> shows bell peppers as containing no capsaicin so why is it in the list and is it considered a chili?</p>

<p>I'm confused Please clarify.</p>

<p><a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/2642/what-do-i-need-to-know-about-temperature-and-food-safety"">A related question</a> mentions that ""Even if the bacteria is dead, toxins can remain if the food was out too long, causing problems"".  However, there's no further detail given.  Are these toxins as dangerous as the bacteria themselves?  How long does meat have to be left out to accumulate a dangerous level of toxins and thus be dangerous even if thoroughly cooked?  Are these toxins the reason for the usual guideline of keeping meat unrefrigerated for a maximum of 2 hours?</p>

<h2>update</h2>

<p>The revelation, courtesy of Aaronut, that <em>e. coli</em> is actually dangerous because of its toxins — which cannot be denatured at temperatures which will leave meat in an edible state — has pretty much answered this question.  And also given me further incentive to stop eating meat altogether :)</p>

"Sous Vide Brisket Interrupted, is that safe?","<p>First of all, sorry for my bad english, I'm a foreign.</p>

<p>I'm new at sous vide world, and have a doubt, and I'm wondering if someone more experienced can help me.</p>

<p>For days I was looking for the ingredients to make this recipe: <a href=""https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/smokerless-smoked-brisket"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/smokerless-smoked-brisket</a></p>

<p>I did all like the recipe says, including using the Prague Powder nº 1 (very difficult to buy in Brazil since the sell was restricted by law).</p>

<p><strong>The Problem:</strong></p>

<p>After the meat rested for 3 hours with Prague Powder, was a little late, about 12:00 am, than at 12:30 am I put pre-heated water over 50ºC (122ºF) on the container, and also the meat, programed to cook at 68ºC (154,4ºF), timed for 24 hours. About 01:00 AM, the water reached the target temperature and cooked ok until about 9:00 am, when power was out and obviously turned off the equipment. </p>

<p>I wasn't at home and just figured out when was already 06:00 pm and the water was at 35ºC (95ºF) when immediately I started to heat the water again, with take about one hour to reach 68ºC (154,4ºF), after reached the temperature I let it cook for more 16:30.</p>

<p><strong>Relevant Facts:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>I tested, in same container, with same water volume that was cooked the meat, how long it takes to drop the temperature to the critical 54,4°C (130ºF), and the answer is at least 55 minutes;</p></li>
<li><p>Based on that test I think the meat keeped in critical temperature for about 8 hours;</p></li>
<li><p>I used well-prepared vacuum packaging, which left almost no air inside.
The meat has about 70 mm thickness.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The first cook (8 hours at 68ºC (154,4ºF)) was enough to pasteurize the meat?</li>
<li>Prague Powder can help to prevent pathogens?</li>
<li>Is it safe to eat this meat?</li>
<li>What can I expect with the interruption of cooking in terms of loss?</li>
</ul>

<p>I appreciate if someone with more experience than me can help me.</p>

I set the Hamilton Beach mixer on speed 4 for 10 minutes. But now I got a KitchenAid Artisan mixer, and am having trouble with the exact same recipe.</p>

I then searched and found some advice to knead at speed 4 for about 10 minutes. I did and my dough passed the window pane test but somehow after rising during the shaping the crust/surface of the buns show a non-smooth surface (happens a lot more on whole wheat). What are some of the reasons this happens? The same recipe works perfectly with the Hamilton Beach mixer. Any advice on the technicalities would be appreciated. </p>

How can I obtain perfectly peeled boiled eggs?,"<p>Let me put some context to this question.</p>

<p>I didn't pay much attention to it at the time, but looking back at it now, I marvel that anyone can boil and peel a huge number of eggs and get everyone of them this perfectly peeled. My own talent, which includes pouring a generous amount of salt in the boiling water and plunging the eggs into cold water promptly 3-5 minutes after boiling, produces the rather unapetizing result you see below.</p>

Why do i get flat and crack french macaron tops,"<p>I have tried to make chocolate macarons several times now. Each time I get a flat cookie (no feet) with a cracked top.
I've tried baking them at 325 as well as 300 F. Each time, around 4-6 minutes in the oven, they begin to crack. I tried doubling the cookie sheets and leaving one empty cookie sheet at the bottom shelf. I also have an oven thermometer, so I know my oven temperature is correct.</p>

<p>I used aged egg whites ( at least 24 hours old) and I let them dry for 30-40 minutes before putting them in the oven.</p>

<p>They all cracked on top and the surface collapsed as you see in the picture. I did some research and watched youtube videos to find out what I am doing wrong. As I figured the following factor could be the reason behind ugly macaroons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I read somewhere that the time you let the batch sit and dry before putting i the oven is an important factor. I let it rest for 45 minutes to one hour instead of 20-30 minutes, but the result was the same, if not worse.</p></li>
<li><p>The other factor is beating egg whites to stiff peaks. There, I think this is where my problem come from. So I beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt to medium peak stage, then add in the sugar in 3 batches while mixing with hand mixer. After watching several videos I know what stiff peaks look like, or at least I think so. But trying the recipe keeping that point in mind it still had the same result: </p></li>

Freezing French baguette dough,"<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m08i8oXpFB0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">In this video</a>, the author makes 4 French baguettes. That is probably 2 more baguettes than I can eat before they get stale.</p>

<p>Recipe (transcribed from the video):</p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bread flour, 700 g</li>
<li>Instant dried yeast, 0.5 tsp</li>
<li>Kosher salt, 1.5 tsp</li>
<li>Cool tap water, 520 g</li>
</ul>

<p>Steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Whisk 1st 3 ingredients together.</li>
<li>Add water and mix with the handle of a wooden spoon.</li>
<li>Cover the bowl with clear wrap and rest for 45 minutes at room temperature.</li>
<li>Repeat 4 times:

<ul>
<li>Turn onto a flat surface, wet your hands, and fold from each side to center, then use a dough scraper to put the dough back into the bowl (2:30 in the video).</li>
<li>Cover the bowl with clear wrap and rest for 45 minutes at room temperature.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sprinkle the work surface with bench flour and turn out the dough.</li>
<li>Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces (each about 310 g).</li>
<li>Shape the baguettes (6:30).</li>
<li>Leaving the baguettes on the work surface, cover them with lightly oiled clear wrap.</li>
<li>Let them rest for 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Prepare a well floured bakers couche (7:20).</li>
<li>Form the baguettes (7:50), dust lightly, and transfer to the couche.</li>
<li>Cover with a tea towel and let them rise for 20 minutes, then a further 12 minutes while the oven preheats to 200°C/400°F.</li>
<li>Place a pan of boiling water in the bottom of the oven.</li>
<li>Transfer each baguette to a lightly oiled baking sheet using a peel or cardboard covered in aluminum foil (10:45).</li>
<li>Spray the baguettes lightly with water</li>
<li>Score the baguettes with a razor blade or very sharp knife (11:20).</li>
<li>Place the baking sheet(s) in the oven and spray a little water over them to moisten the crust.</li>
<li>Bake for 8 minutes, then turn the baking sheet(s) 180° for more even baking, releasing the steam from the oven carefully.</li>
<li>Transfer the baguettes to a cooling rack.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that I have not tried this recipe yet, but plan to very soon.</p>

Help with seasoning cast iron wok,"<p>I recently bought a cast iron wok and attempted to season twice.</p>

<p>The first time i seasoned it i think i overheated the wok and it started to smoke when i added oil and some shiny black stains which looks like patina formed.</p>

<p>I tried seasoning a second time but after seasoning, it didn't seem that non stick to me.</p>

<p>Here are the steps i took to season the wok.</p>

<p>1) Scrub thoroughly with hot water and soap</p>

<p>2) on low to medium heat evaporate all the water </p>

<p>3) add in oil and stir fry some onions (some videos say it gets rid of the initial metallic taste)</p>

<p>4) after 5-10 mins i took it off the heat and let it cool</p>

<p>5) i rinsed it with water after and applied a thin layer of oil</p>

<p>This is the first time i'm seasoning a wok and i have no idea if is working out but i noticed that everytime i wipe it with some tissue paper, the tissue paper turns black! I'm considering throwing it away and any help would be appreciated.</p>

I seasoned with flaxseed oil (4 light coats, hour in the oven), and have cooked a few things - I made some Ghee, fried some onions, stuff like that. After each I washed with hot water (no soap), heated until dry on the stove and coated with a thin layer of canola oil.</p>

<p>Now, when I take a dry paper towel and rub it on the pan, a black residue shows up on the paper towel. I can't feel anything with my fingers and I haven't noticed anything cooking with it. I'm fairly confident this occurred <em>after</em> the initial seasoning - although I'm not sure I did this exact test with the paper towel.</p>

<p>Is this a) normal, or b) what is wrong and c) how can I fix it?</p>

Bottom Round Roast Troubleshooting,"<p>The other day, my family chose to make something akin to ""roast beef"" for the holidays. Since most markets were closed, we found a small shop which sold a limited selection of beef cuts. The one we eventually picked up was labeled ""Bottom Round Roast"". Needless to say, upon roasting it, it didn't exactly turn out as planned. While the end-product was quite juicy and flavorful, it was also also uncomfortably tough. Since this isn't a cut we've used before, I'm curious to know if anyone can help us troubleshoot.</p>

<p>Here's how it was cooked:</p>

<ul>
<li>Salted about 2 hours in advance</li>
<li>Roasted--mid-rack--in a conventional oven at 225 degrees</li>
<li>Removed from the oven when a thermopen read about 125-130 degrees F, and rested for 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Finished stovetop in butter and thyme, about 45 seconds to a minute per side, until a thermopen confirmed the middle was medium rare.</li>
<li>Sliced against the grain--visibly medium rare.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does this cut simply need more time? Clearly it doesn't behave like a prime rib. Any tips for next time?</p>
",86775,29-12-2017 03:07,Why did my roast beef turn out chewy and not tender? Where did I go wrong?,"<p>I recently made an <code>Oven Round Roast</code> in the oven and I followed directions quite well. I would really like to know where I went wrong.</p>

<p>The roast was 1.4kg and relatively round in shape, it was also quite nicely marbled with a big strip of fat on one side.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Out from the freezer and into the fridge overnight (to give it some time to cool down) and then left it out in room temperature for a
  couple of hours. Took out of package and put on a rub.</p></li>
  <li><p>I put the oven on 450 F and put the roast in (fat side up) for 10 minutes for the maillard reaction. Note that when I did this, I put it
  directly on the oven rack; I put a tray underneath to catch the
  drippings, but it was uncovered.</p></li>
  <li><p>Turned oven down to 225 for 2 hours and then 200 for 5 hours. </p></li>
  <li><p>Cut the roast into half inch slices and served.</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The color was a nice pink on the inside and dark on the outside. It was still juicy and the taste was great. The roast's outside is absolutely delicious in fact, the rub turned out so well and the fat was amazingly tasty. </p>

<p>However, the roast was so chewy, I am very disappointed. I did a lot of research before I cooked it and found that slow cooking is a good way to tenderize meat. I also found out that certain cuts of meat need to be cooked differently. I.e. Steak should be hot and fast, and roast cuts should be long and slow (after searing it of course... yum yum yum). </p>

<p>In <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/4157/why-do-some-foods-taste-better-the-next-day/8760#8760"">this</a> post, 'Marti' answered by quoting a TV chef saying that when beef is being cooked it's collagen breaks down and liquifies and when it cools it turns to gelatine. Could that be what happened to my beef roast? If so, how can I avoid that?</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/3378/how-should-baking-soda-be-used-to-tenderize-meat"">this</a> post, 'Gilead' suggested a few solutions, beating the meat, cutting it against the grain, and choosing the right cooking method. Well, did I do the right cooking method? And do the other ones apply to a roast? I mean if you cut it up, it's basically cheap beef steak and I've never tried mechanically tenderizing the meat. </p>

<p>I really appreciate any help; I'm quite distraught over this chewy beef roast.</p>

Storing fresh sourdough,"<p>I would like to know what is the best way to store fresh baked sourdough so that it maintains a nice crunchy crust and a nice soft, slightly moist, light texture?  I usually store it at room temperature in a large tupperware with a loose fitting lid or on the countertop. I have finally succeeded in baking the perfect sourdough; I am very happy:) I now just need to know what storage method I should use. I know it stores well in the freezer.</p>

<p>I made a research and I found this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>EU
  regulations forbid the use of fresh raw fish. It must be frozen at
  temperatures below −20 °C (−4 °F) in all parts of the product for no
  less than 24 hours.[66] As such, a number of fishing boats, suppliers
  and end users ""super-freeze"" fish for sushi to temperatures as low as
  −60 °C.[67] As well as parasite destruction, super-freezing also
  prevents oxidation of the blood in tuna flesh, thus preventing the
  discoloration that happens at temperatures above −20 °C.[68]</p>

Seasoning of Cast Iron seems to be coming off?,"<p>I have 3 new Lodge cast iron pans I got from amazon. </p>

<p>They seem to not be nonstick whatsoever and after cooking I see large patches of silver or what appears to be bare metal.</p>

<p>They came pre-seasoned. I seasoned them again 6 to 10 times each before use following this method:</p>

<p>1) Apply layer of flaxseed or grapeseed oil (on one pan I used grapeseed and the other 2 flaxseed to compare).</p>

<p>2) wipe down until pan looks clean </p>

<p>3) place in cold oven upside down and crank heat to 500 f.</p>

<p>4) once oven reached 500, set timer for 1 hour.</p>

<p>5) after 1 hour, turn off oven and let pans cool inside oven for about 2 to 4 hours  </p>

<p>Repeat 6 to 10 times.  </p>

<p>Never used soap to wash. No steel wool. Sponge only.  Never used metal utensils. Used wooden spatula to scrape off stuck on food. </p>

<p>Every time this happens and I'm starting to wonder if I should just toss them away. 
I spent a lot of money. Help.</p>

<p>Maybe my meat thermometer is inaccurate? Maybe I should go beyond 200 next time.</p>

<p>It was a very small brisket, about 4.5 pounds.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ssihs.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ssihs.png"" alt=""Smoker and meat temperature""></a></p>
",108385,14-05-2020 19:30,Smoked a brisket that was edible but not great. What would you do differently?,"<p>I smoked my first brisket last weekend and even though it wasn't terrible it was a little dryer and rougher than I would have liked.</p>

<p>Here is the smoker I used: <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00B7W8NHW"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B7W8NHW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a></p>

<p>Here are the steps I followed (along with some notes on things I may have done wrong):</p>

<ol>
<li>I bought a four pound fresh brisket from a butcher.  It was 9.99/lb (next time I'm going to hit up Sam's club and try and get a 10-12 lb packer cut of USDA Choice)</li>
<li>I used Stubb's store bought dry rub.  I rubbed it on and then seared the meat on the grill.  I did not sear the fat cap. (Should I have let the dry rub sit longer?  Also, next time I'm thinking about doing equal parts salt, pepper, and paprika.  Should I have seared at all?  A lot of people seem to throw the meat right in the smoker after giving the dry rub some time to set in).</li>
<li>I had turned the smoker on and set it to 200 degrees before searing, so when I put the brisket in it was at 200 degrees and was already smoking.  I used dry wood chips and filled the water pan to the mark specified in the pan.</li>
<li>The smoker stopped producing smoke about 30 min in.  I wet some wood chips and put them in, but the smoke never came back.  (How often should I be adding wood chips?  Should they be wet? How long should the smoker be spitting out smoke?)</li>
<li>I let it sit for six hours.  I didn't have a meat thermometer at the time.  (What internal temp should I go for next time?)</li>
<li>I pulled the meat out, didn't wrap it in foil, and cut it after 20 min.  The bark looked nice but the meat was brown like a pot roast. I know when I get good restraunt BBQ that the meat tends to be a little red/pink.  The meat still tasted ok although it was a little tough.</li>
</ol>

<p>Other questions.  Should I have wrapped the brisket in foil at some point?  When should I do this and what are instructions for after?  Some people seem to advocate doing so once the meat hits ~150 degrees F which will drastically decrease the cooking time.  Others seem to advocate taking the brisket out when it hits about 180, wrapping it in foil, then putting it in an empty cooler until it rises to ~200.</p>

<p>I know that this is really a bunch of questions rolled into one but I feel like this is a typical experience for a smoking newbie like myself.  I don't expect answers for every item but please try and point out the things I've done which are just empirically wrong.</p>

How do you actually manipulate raw meat safely?,"<p>I understand the need for hand-washing and food safety procedures. What I don't understand is how you physically manipulate raw meat while maintaining safety. For example, if I'm roasting a chicken, I need to unwrap the bird, put it on the cutting board, blot it dry, salt and pepper it (thus handling loose salt and the pepper grinder while also turning the bird, holding the body cavity open, etc.), and put it on the roasting pan. It feels like I need to stop every ten seconds to wash my hands, but that can't be right, can it? If nothing else, the precariousness of balancing a chicken on its shoulders while holding the cavity open with one hand so I can pour salt in with my untainted other hand just seems wrong. </p>

<p>So: how do you safely manipulate raw meat?</p>

Is there a way to un warp a pan bottom?,"<p>I have recently moved into a new home, and for now, I'm stuck with a horrible electric glass top stove.  My old place had a gas stove with a continuous grate across the cooking surface.  All my pans are carbon steel or cast iron.  (I take good care of my pans, so it's not an issue of abuse or putting cold water in a hot pan, or immediately rinsing a hot pan in cold water.  With the exception of my woks, they are bullet proof). </p>

<p>I am finding that most of my carbon steel pans have a slight warp to the bottom, which was never a problem on the gas range.  But is proving to be rather annoying on the new electric one.  So in theory is there a way to unwarp or to lessen the warping on the bottom of the pan?  In a way this will be academic and I am willing to sacrifice one of my cheaper pans to experiment the unwarping theories.  Thanks.</p>

Is that the right way?</p>

<p>However - I also don't particularly feel like subsisting on McDonalds until then, so I have thought of a possible solution and wanted to put it to the crowd to weigh in on whether it is safe.</p>

<p>Basically, I've been slow cooking vegetable soup and keeping it on 'low' in the crockpot until the dish has been eaten - then, I repeat the process.</p>

<p>I have done this 4 times already with successful results on each occasion: to my surprise, the dish was still tasty after 3 days, although I was initially nervous about eating something that had been cooking for so long.</p>

<p>I measured the temperature of the food and it remains about 70C the whole time.</p>

<p>So here's my question.</p>

<p>Is this a viable solution until my refrigerator arrives or is there something unsafe about cooking foods for such long periods? Is there an upper limit on how long food can be cooked for and stay good?</p>

<p>Normally the pot was stored in the fridge overnight.</p>

<p>Food items added were sometimes plate leftovers from fellow flat (share house) mates, who would in turn be eating the soup, too.</p>

<p>Most days other ingredients would be fresh(ish) vegetables, beans, grains, and fresh meat products sourced from the local butcher as money allowed.</p>

<p>Brussels sprouts where banned, and so were strong spices (you added those to your bowl before serving).</p>

<p>Also, for irony, a large (cleaned) stone is always left in the pot.</p>

<p>Fresh bread was sometimes baked in the oven while cracked bones were browning, but the oven was often an electrical and environmental death trap.</p>

<p>The pot kept going till the summer holidays, and no one got food poisoning in my time, or from any student stories I have ever heard.</p>

<p>This sort of activity is recorded in history as being a popular resource-saving idea.</p>

Emulsifying homemade coconut milk?,"<p>I've been experimenting with fresh coconuts lately (they are amazing), but one thing I haven't figured out yet is how to make a nice creamy coconut milk. Mainly to make hot chocolate and eat with fruits like an yogurt,</p>

<p>So I put the coconut water and the meat in a (not very good) blender, strained it through a sieve and refrigerated it, this is the result:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OZ3pt.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OZ3pt.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The part at the top is a grainy, watery coconut mush, I was expecting it to be like cream/yogurt</p>

<p>And the part at the bottom I assume it's really just coconut water.</p>

<p>Looking at a carton of store-bought full fat coconut milk it contains chemical emulsifiers and thickeners, so is there no way of achieving a natural creamy coconut milk?</p>

<p>And the store bought one never mentions it was pasteurized, one of my ideas was water bathing the glass.</p>

<p>I also thought abount whisking it but not sure about it yet.</p>

<p>So, what can be done to achieve a homogenous, creamy, eat-by-itself, homemade coconut milk?</p>

<p>The traditional method of making sour cream is easy to describe: milk is spun using a centrifuge so as to extract a heavy cream, which is 1 part cream, 9 parts milk. (Cream for butter is lighter than this). The heavy cream is then cooled to thicken it, then the temperature is increased to about 85F. A small amount (1:20) of sour cream is added to initiate fermentation and the cream is gently stirred for 2 hours, then allowed to sit for 6 hours or to taste. When it is sour, it is refrigerated. In this state it can last for 2-3 months.</p>

<p>Modern recipes I have seen for home cooks obviously do not follow this method, because it requires having a milk separator and raw milk. Instead these recipes mix in buttermilk with light cream, or other methods, which are not true to the original method. However, I am wondering if store-bought sour creams follows the traditional method, or do modern commercial processes use light cream also?</p>

Carbonized oil when seasoning carbon steel,"<p>I've been trying to season my 11 7/8"" Matfer Bourgeat Carbon Steel pan, with mixed success. The first time I did it, I had this weird patch of my pan that wasn't very nonstick, so I scrubbed off the bad part and tried again. </p>

<p>The last time I did it, I added about 1/3 cup of soy oil (smoke point around 320F) to the pan and put it over medium heat on a gas burner for 15 minutes. After the 15 minutes, I noticed that the sides of the pan were pretty amber colored, but the middle was still kind of metallic looking. At that point, I dumped some oil out and let it sit at medium heat for about three minutes. I looked away for not more than 30 seconds and my pan had developed this black, carbonized, sticky film of oil on the middle and some of the sides of the pan. (Picture included)</p>

<p>I'm not sure how to proceed from here. I'm thinking I will have to clean it off the film. To do this, I'm thinking of heating the pan with water, and a bit of vinegar, before taking the heat off and adding some baking soda. Then I would hit it with scotch bright and steel wool (fingers crossed that should work). But from there, I don't know what I should do differently to get a even, amber seasoning to my pan. </p>

<p>Any suggestions for how to clean this off, and what to do differently in the seasoning proccess would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks :) </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I have looked around a bit, and I see that I should have:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Used thinner coats of oil, let them cool, and repeat several times.</li>
<li>Expect the actual color change to happen as the pan is cooling.  </li>
</ul>

<p>However, I wonder how much oil I actually should use for a pan this size. 1/3 cup is definitely too much. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At first, water molecules are attached to and trapped within this
  protein mesh, so the tissue remains juicy and tender. But after a
  short time, if the protein is in a very acidic marinade, the protein
  bonds tighten, water is squeezed out, and the tissue becomes tough. If
  you've ever tried marinating shrimp in highly acidic ingredients, it's
  likely that you're familiar with this result.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My experience with tenderizing enzymes mirrors that of Dr. Nicholas
  Kurti, a famous Oxford physicist who tried tenderizing a pork roast by
  injecting half with pineapple juice, leaving the other half untouched.
  A noted chef, Michel Roux, was to judge on television which side was
  better. After cooking, the half treated with pineapple was total mush
  and looked like a pile of stuffing. Not surprisingly, Chef Roux
  preferred the untreated half.</p>

<p><a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/2642/what-do-i-need-to-know-about-temperature-and-food-safety"">A related question</a> mentions that ""Even if the bacteria is dead, toxins can remain if the food was out too long, causing problems"".  However, there's no further detail given.  Are these toxins as dangerous as the bacteria themselves?  How long does meat have to be left out to accumulate a dangerous level of toxins and thus be dangerous even if thoroughly cooked?  Are these toxins the reason for the usual guideline of keeping meat unrefrigerated for a maximum of 2 hours?</p>

<h2>update</h2>

<p>The revelation, courtesy of Aaronut, that <em>e. coli</em> is actually dangerous because of its toxins — which cannot be denatured at temperatures which will leave meat in an edible state — has pretty much answered this question.  And also given me further incentive to stop eating meat altogether :)</p>

What are the different distinct groups of spicy,"<p>I remember being told once long ago that there are 7 different types of spicy:</p>

<p>-Capsaicin (chilli)<br>
-Horseradish (Wasabi)<br>
-Ginger<br>
-Mustard<br>
-Cinnamon<br>
-Garlic<br>
-Cloves  </p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> breaks them up into the following 8 botanical groups: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>-Fruits, such as Cayenne pepper<br>
  -Roots and rhizomes, such as turmeric, ginger and galingale<br>
  -Seeds, such as fennel, mustard, nutmeg, and black pepper<br>
  -Barks, such as cinnamon and cassia<br>
  -Flower buds, such as cloves<br>
  -Stigmas, such as saffron<br>
  -Arils, such as mace (part of nutmeg plant fruit)<br>
  -Resins, such as asafoetida  </p>

"Canned food, botulism and ph","<p>Recently i started to do some home-made canning. The procedure I use is</p>

<ol>
<li>Use a pressure cooker to build the jars (cristal ones) for about 10 minutes at 120C.</li>
<li>Cook my vegetables (normally tomatoes, garlic, capsicum, eggplant, zuchini) the whole mix surely has a ph over 4.6 which is where the Clostridium botulinum lives.</li>
<li>Put the cooked vegatables in the cristal jars (which will still be hot), close them, and put them back into the pressure cooker.</li>
<li>Cook the closed jars for 20-25 minutes at 120C</li>
</ol>

<p>My understanding is that botulism is a very serious disease, the most concerning part is that it does not alter the taste, color or texture of the food.</p>

<p>Currently I consume my canned food within 1 week.</p>

<p>The question is, given that I use 120C degrees when cooking, can I be reasonably safe? Is there a significant risk? </p>

<p>Follow up question: I would like to not only store my cooked vegetables, but also cook them with tofu or chicken and then preserve them using the same procedure, however I have not done so as I know tofu has quite a high PH. Would it be safe to use vegetables + tofu/chicken in the preserves?</p>

<p>What was the reason for not using the pasta water? Or in other words, when should you not want to add pasta water? (other than in cold pasta dishes like salads)</p>

"Is my chicken stock still safe to eat? Left on stove on low-medium heat, partially uncovered +9 hours so it reduced","<p>My boyfriend and I are new to cooking and might have made a few errors while making our chicken stock overnight. This is what happened, can someone tell me if our broth is still safe to eat? We started this pot at night, around 8pm.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We stuck a whole chicken in a huge pot of water with some veggies added for aromatics and brought it a strong boil and then simmered for maybe 1 hr and 20 min.</p></li>
<li><p>At this point, we turn off the stove and take the chicken out to break down all the meat and put the bone carcass back in the pot.</p></li>
<li><p>We turn back on the stove and decide to let the bone broth keep going overnight. It's probably 9pm and I'm already upstairs and he turns back on the stock but doesn't close the lid all the way, leaving it 25% exposed all night.</p></li>
<li><p>I wake up at 5:30am and find the pot of stock is gently bubbling and has completely reduced, with maybe 3.5 inches of concentrated broth in a large pot, with all the bones exposed and maybe halfway covered in water.</p></li>
<li><p>I fill up the pot again with room temperature water and close the lid, not adjusting the heat. Maybe 20 minutes later I decide I probably should bring it to a boil to be safe, and at this time I fish out all the veggies since I don't want them to break down more. The carrots and celery stalks are all still intact, just really soft. Onions were still somewhat intact but I think a lot of them turned to mush in the pot overnight.</p></li>
<li><p>Now we are just going to let it simmer for a tiny bit more to get everything reconstituted.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>After doing research I'm not sure if this pot of stock is salvageable and safe to eat, can someone advise me on whether to dump this or if it's okay to use this stock to make soup?</p>

<p>Thank you so much for your help :)!</p>

When to cook week old moose meat?,"<p>I have obtained a large chunk of approximately week old moose meat that has been never stored in a freezer. I'm planning to eat it during the next week or two.</p>

<p>I cut it to 8 smaller steak-sized chunks, and cut 4 of those into small bits of which I'm going to make moose stew with carrots and onions. I'm just fried the small bits in my frying pan, and am currently making the stew in my pot.</p>

<p>The trouble is, I don't have a large frying pan or a large pot. I only have one small pot which I have free to use for the moose stew. The small bits of half of the moose meat fit in there with carrots and onions.</p>

<p>What should I do for the 4 other steak-sized chunks?</p>

<ul>
<li>Should I just store them unfried in the refrigerator and cook when I need to, which will be approximately week from now? (Currently they are in the refrigerator, but I can always fry them in my frying pan that is free now.)</li>
<li>Should I fry them in my frying pan and store them in the refrigerator after frying them?</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to maximize the amount of time the meat stays edible. If it stays edible for only one week from now, I have to eat moose meat every day. If it stays edible for two weeks, I can eat moose meat only every other day.</p>

<p>I of course theoretically have the option of just storing the rest in my freezer, but my freezer (or actually two freezers) are half full with frozen moose meat!</p>

Thinking that it would be a reasonable broth substitute, I have several times tried poaching in that liquid instead of the broth or water.

It's certainly not dangerous, but it isn't very appetizing.</p>

Can't get beans to cook to tender,"<p>I’m having a horrible time trying to get beans cooked to be tender and not bitter.  Overnight soaking and rapid soak methods aren’t making any difference.  If I add anything to the cooking process, it’s a piece of onion and/or a hot green chili.  These beans soak for at least 10 hours and cook for over 4!  </p>

<p>Ok, so maybe at my store, the beans are old.  The packages are never past the pull date. How do you tell just by looking whether they’re “too old”?</p>
",93606,05-11-2018 04:20,Baked beans still firm after soaking and hours of cooking,"<p>I decided I would make baked beans for a BBQ at my MIL's this past weekend. I've never made baked beans but decided that it was time since I love them so much! I found a recipe for Southern Baked Beans (using Navy beans). It was from a food blog. </p>

<p>During the description/commentary of the dish the blogger said they could be made with dried beans but she uses canned to save time. The recipe only mentioned canned beans. I couldn't find anything to tell me the ratio canned:dried beans so I decide a 1:1 ratio would be good. After putting a 24oz bag of beans in a cake pan (the recipe called for 32oz canned beans), I decided that was A LOT of beans so didn't add the remaining 8oz. I rinsed them first then soaked them for 15-18 hours. I rinsed them again and put them in a pot with the rest of the ingredients. </p>

<p>The recipe said to bake them at 350 for about 40 minutes and they should be done. After an hour and a temperature increase to 400, the beans weren't anywhere close to being done. At this point I decided they were probably very old beans. :( I moved them to the stove after another 30 minutes. They boiled on the stove for another 1 1/2 hours and were still rock hard (I kept adding water so they wouldn't boil dry - and this was on medium to medium-low heat). </p>

<p>We left the beans at my MIL's and she cooked them ""off and on"" (her words) the next day and declared they were done. They are not done. :(</p>

<p>Now that they've been cooked then refrigerated then cooked then refrigerated again, can I attempt to salvage them? I've read that adding 1/8 tsp baking soda per cup of beans will soften them. Is it too late to try this - add the beans, more water, and a small amount of baking soda and cook them a little more? I've put so much effort into these stupid beans I can't just give up! LOL</p>

Banana bread batter in the fridge,"<p>I am from South Africa and we are currently having what our main energy supplier is calling loadshedding. Basically various municipalities have their electricity cut at relatively random times to lift the load. The news did not report any shedding for today, but as I finished making my banana loaf batter, the power went out. It will be out for anything between 1 and 6 hours. Do I leave the batter out while waiting or in the fridge? Contains baking powder, butter and eggs, so my questions are: Will putting the batter in the fridge for that amount of time effect the outcomes of the baking? We are in Africa, so atmospheric temperatures are high, about 36 Celsius today. Is it more risky to leave the batter out, in terms of food poisoning, or in the fridge in terms of outcomes of the baking?! 😂
Also: had I already put the baking in the oven, what would have been the best course of action? Take out and wait, put in fridge or leave in oven? (recipe asks for 50 minutes in the oven) </p>

How to cook in olive oil,"<p>There are plenty of recipes regarding how to cook fish, and other foods, in olive oil.</p>

<p>This puzzles me because olive oil has a very low smoking point. So I'll burn it if I cook fish at 350 degrees. If I set the temp to 200 degrees, the fish will cook for ages and will basically boil in it's own juices.</p>

<p>So how do seasoned cooks deal with this? How do you cook in olive oil?</p>

Does any flavor benefit from the oil actually remain?</p>

How to counteract sage (in a pumpkin soup)?,"<p>I prepared a pumpkin soup with the secondary ingredients being onions, ginger, garlic, cream, chilli, nutmeg, pumpkin seed oil, and sage.
I accidentally added too much of the latter.
I wish to neutralise this.</p>

<p>I found and tried the following so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>General counteracting advice</strong> like diluting and adding more of (almost) everything else, both of which I do not wish to do.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Physically removing</strong> the sage, which are not applicable in my case since the sage was ground.    </p></li>
<li><p>Adding <strong>sugar</strong> (or sweet ingredients).
I did this to some extent, but perceived no effect.
While the sweetness hasn’t spoiled the soup yet, I am afraid that adding more of it might.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://www.spiceography.com/too-much-sage/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This site</a> recommends to add <strong>potatoes</strong>, which are claimed to soak up excess spices (in general).
I am skeptical about this claim since I cannot find any other source corroborating this.
Said source uses a very distancing language in this section.
Moreover, if potatoes really suck up flavours in general, they may be of little use for me due to sucking up everything else.</p></li>
<li><p>By chance, I found that adding <strong>salt</strong> (or salty ingredients) reduces the effect, but only to a certain extent.
Also, this comes with the downside of the soup being overly salty.</p></li>

<li><strong>strong flour</strong> (UK) aka. <strong>hard flour</strong> (UK) is higher gluten flour, such as <strong>bread flour</strong> (US)</li>
<li><strong>self-rising flour</strong> (US) is available in the US, but less common. It is referred to as <strong>self-raising flour</strong> in the UK, AU and NZ.  Although it has baking powder in it, it does not have fat in it such as Bisquick or other 'baking mixes'.<br />

"The more I season, the worse it gets with my cast iron","<p>Recently, I bought a cast iron skillet, which was preseasoned. Still, I did season it a couple of times and since then I season it after every cook. I didn't cook anything crazy, just a dutch baby and a pizza.</p>

<p>Still, even after multiple seasonings, there is a clear hole in my seasoning in the middle of the pan:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ah6dJ.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ah6dJ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>How I season it:</p>

<p>I put some oil in it, spread the oil with a paper towel, then heat it on the stove until it starts smoking, then let it cool.</p>

<p>I tried olive oil, which apparently is no good, so I switched to sunflower oil and now I am trying it with canola oil. I also switched from paper towel to regular towel, but still, the hole just seems to be getting bigger and bigger. When I touch it with my finger, I can see black residue on it.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong here? Yesterday I even did a couple of seasonings one after another (let it cool, oil it, heat it, repeat), but this seems to have been counterproductive.</p>
",95649,14-01-2019 16:44,How do I fix improperly seasoned cast iron pans?,"<p>I'm quite new to cooking as a whole.</p>

<p>A few months back I bought a set of VonShef cast iron pans. When seasoning them, I unfortunately made two errors. First, in my naïveté, I used vegetable oil as the seasoning; and second, I didn't remove the excess oil, leaving a sticky and uneven finish in the pans. After a couple of failed attempts at cooking with this situation, and some food sticking to the pans, I've been putting off using them to avoid further catastrophes.</p>

<p>So how can I go about rectifying my mistakes? I've watched a few videos on YouTube about the proper way of seasoning, and it seems you can clear seasoning by either sanding it down or burning the pan. But how would you also clear off burnt food stuck to the pan?</p>

<p>I hope you can see what I mean in the below pictures.</p>

Can't stop eggs from sticking to stainless steel pan,"<p>I've made omelettes in this pan before without any problems, but fried eggs are impossible to make without sticking.I heat the pan, throw few drops of water and check if they move around (some would say like mercury), lower the heat, pour oil and then put eggs in.I've tried to monitor the temperature carefully to make sure that the pan isn't too hot, still no success.Is my pan the problem?</p>
",96144,04-02-2019 17:17,Trouble frying an egg on a stainless steel pan,"<p>I recently purchased a stainless steel pan from AllClad, but I'm struggling to use it. Food, and in particular eggs, seem to stick readily to the pan, making it hard to use. There is a question on Seasoned Advice that pertains to cooking an omelette on a stainless steel pan, but I think the challenges of frying an egg are different and more challenging. I've been able to cook an omelette in this pan, but have yet to succeed with a fried egg.</p>

<p>Looking online, I learned that stainless steel pans, like cast-iron, need to be seasoned in order to be non-stick. The process that I followed to season my pan was as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pour in 1/4 cup walnut oil. </li>
<li>Heat pan on medium heat until the oil begins to smoke.</li>
<li>Turn heat off and let the pan cool completely.</li>
<li>Remove the oil and wipe the pan dry.</li>
</ol>

<p>I tried this process, but when I try to fry an egg in the pan, it still sticks readily. There is some improvement, but it is still not possible to cook an egg without sticking that destroys the egg in the end.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what I may be doing wrong, or is a stainless steel pan just not something that one can use for frying eggs? Should I just expect that there will be some stick whenever I use this pan?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>After watching <a href=""https://rouxbe.com/cooking-school/how-to-pan-fry/details"" rel=""noreferrer"">this short course on pay frying</a>, I tried to pre-heat my pan, using the water-test as a guide, and adding just a bit of oil to the pan before dropping the egg in. The results were the same. The egg stuck to the pan thoroughly. So again I'm not sure what I'm doing incorrectly. Maybe the oil I'm using isn't right? I've been using ghee.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>:</p>

<p>I've yet to succeed in frying a egg on this pan, but a few additional questions/issues have surfaced:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Some answers here have suggested that despite the presence on the web of tutorials for ""seasoning"" stainless steel pan this is not necessary and may not be advisable.</p></li>
<li><p>The trick may be to fry the egg starting at a much lower heat then you might with something like a piece of meat. For meat, you often encounter the suggestion to use the ""water test"", but as at least one answer has suggested here that may not work with a fried egg. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>These are the possibly insights I've gleaned so far, but I've also yet to succeed, so these may turn out to be wrong as well.</p>

<p><strong>Satisfying Answer (May be others)</strong></p>

<p>The solution that I have settled on here -- i.e. what finally worked for me -- was to work with lower heat than I thought was needed, and not to season the pan. There is definitely a lot of conflicting information out there about stainless steel pans. There are a great number of blog posts and YouTube videos that talk about how to season a pan. Seasoning may still be a useful thing to do, but I was able to fry an egg on an unseasoned pan finally.</p>

<p>The method I used is more or less as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Clean pan thoroughly.</p></li>
<li><p>Take egg out of refrigerator and let it sit in warm water for five minutes or so. (This may not be necessary.)</p></li>
<li><p>Put pan on stove on medium flame/heat. (I only tried this on a gas stove.)</p></li>
<li><p>Let pan pre-heat until it is warm when you hold your hands over the pan. Warm, not hot! This might take 20-30 seconds, maybe less. </p></li>
<li><p>Add the oil (1-2 tbsp), and lower the flame to low. Let the oil heat a bit, perhaps another 10-15 seconds, or less.</p></li>
<li><p>Crack the egg into the pan. The whites should stay clear, only slowly whitening. If the egg begins to turn white immediately, the pan is too hot. And the egg should also not stick at this point. There may be a bit of sticking, especially around the edges. You can dislodge the sticking gently by hand, but don't mess with the egg too much. Cook until done or ready to flip. Make sure heat stays low. If you see some sticking it may be (I'm not sure about this) because the pan has become too hot.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So that's the best I've been able to do with help from the selected answer.</p>

<p>Is this practice of rinsing <em>always</em> advisable, or are there <em>specific</em> cases or kinds of tea where rinsing is necessary? What are we trying to rinse away?  Is the practice only for Chinese tea, or for other kinds of tea as well?</p>

<p>Looking for some enlightenment from some tea experts.  Thank you!</p>

<hr>

<h2>Update:</h2>

<p>Since I asked the question, my mother-in-law came across a newspaper article, in Chinese, describing <strong>pesticides</strong> found on some teas from China, and so it is advisable to rinse before consuming.</p>

<p>Here's a scan I made of the article:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xcupY.png"" alt=""Scanned article about Chinese teas""></p>

<h2>Something in English...</h2>

<p>Essentially, the article references a 2012 report by Greenpeace.  You can read a <a href=""http://www.greenpeace.org/eastasia/press/releases/food-agriculture/2012/chinese-tea-banned-pesticides/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">press release about the report</a>, and here's a link to the report itself: <a href=""http://www.greenpeace.org/eastasia/Global/eastasia/publications/reports/food-agriculture/2012/Pesticide%20Hidden%20Ingredient%20Report%20Final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pesticides: Hidden Ingredients in Chinese Tea Report (PDF)</a>.  Press release summary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Greenpeace investigation has found pesticides banned for use on tea
  in the products marketed by some of China's top tea companies. Some of
  the firms, which include China Tea, Tenfu Tea and China Tea King,
  export tea products to Japan, the US and Europe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For that reason, I accepted the answer below which suggests rinsing for reduction of pesticides.</p>

<p>Of course, I don't think I'd want to drink a tea with 17 kinds of pesticides present, even if rinsed!  Caveat emptor ... I plan to ask more questions when I buy my tea.</p>

A lot of liquid seeps out during the cooking, could this be causing the chicken to seem more steamed than roasted?</p>

<p>Here’s what I do:</p>

<p>I bake a 3-pound roaster chicken at 325-350 deg F, in an electric oven. I place the chicken uncovered on a wire grate over a sheet pan or shallow roasting pan. I seasoned with salt and pepper, following what seems standard procedure in most recipes. I use a meat thermometer and remove the chicken when 160 deg.F. is reached. </p>

<p>I tried dumping out the liquid during roasting, which didn’t help. I even tried browning in a skillet first, but that was just a mess.</p>

Cooking beans in soaking water,"<p>I always drain the water I soaked the beans in overnight and cook them in fresh water. But I've been noticing that the water gets a mild dye of the beans so I was wondering if I'm throwing parts of the baby with the bath water, to be proverbial.</p>

<p>Should beans be cooked in the same water they soaked in?</p>
",97315,05-04-2019 20:44,Black Beans - Toss the soak water?,"<p><strong>I'm making a two pounds of dry black beans by:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Sorting out the rocks, dirt, malformed beans</li>
<li>Washing any dirt or mud from the remaining beans</li>
<li>Soaking for only 1 hour in 2 gallons of water and 2 Tablespoons of salt</li>
<li>Add any non-acidic ingredients and spices</li>
<li>Heating stove top until 212 F </li>
<li>Maintaining temp in oven at 225 F for 3-4 hours</li>
<li>Adding any acid like Tomatoes after cooking is finished</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My Logic is:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Soaking for 1 hour is reported to decrease cooking time</li>
<li>Soaking for 8 hours only decreases cooking time by 30 minutes and makes more beans fall apart</li>
<li>Soaking / cooking in salt reduces skin toughness</li>
<li>Using the soak water in the final product improves taste, nutrients, color, as reported by Alton Brown, many other pro chefs, and most traditional Cuban and Mexican cooks</li>
<li>Salt content of the soak water is about what I'd like in the final product</li>
<li>Using stove top is fastest method of reaching 212 F and avoiding 170-180 F, which increases phytohaemagglutinin (phytohemagglutinin) by 5 x at that temp</li>
<li>Using oven avoids stirring / sicking to the bottom of the pan</li>
<li>Adding any acids like tomatoes increases cooking time</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Answers and feedback requested:</strong></p>

<p>The CDC reports that pouring off the soak water decreases phytohaemagglutinin in the final product.  However, if 30 minutes or more removes most all of the phytohaemagglutinin, why would throwing out the soak water help, and if so, by how much?</p>

<p>Soak water also contains other non-digestible sugars and proteins that can cause problems.  However, extended cooking is also supposed to break these sugars and proteins down.  So, will this increase digestive problems, and if so, by how much?</p>

<p>Any other comments of answers to critique my methods are welcome.</p>

Getting sourdough to rise not spread,"<p><strong>Any pointers on getting a 75% hydration wheat sour dough loaf to hold more shape and spread less?</strong></p>

<p>Full details of current method:</p>

<p>I have a 100% wheatflour levain with a 75% hydration. It is stiffer than most I see online but grows well. It lives in the fridge all week until I make a loaf. It then gets fed with 40 g flour per 30 g of water and left to expand.</p>

<p>I then make a kilogram loaf using 400 g flour and 300 ml water. This is vigorously kneaded for 10 minutes by hand or a good 5 minutes by a Kenwood Chef Mixer with the dough hook.</p>

<p>After being left for an hour in a moist environment then folded and added to a cane banneton it is left untouched until it has expanded by varying amounts (somewhere between 50-100 % extra in volume).</p>

<p>It is only touched once more when the oven is preheated -it is turned out onto a silicone sheet on an oven tray and then placed on a preheated, upturned glass dish to warm the bottom of the loaf. It's then baked in an oven at 220 C for ten minutes and then 200 C for another 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Invariably, the loaf produced is very flat compared to the banneton with a nice crumb and flavour. The crumb is stretchy and a little chewy.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZjYoJ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZjYoJ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I have tried adding less water than this with similar results. This loaf was proved in fridge overnight and baked in the morning. The loaf looks similar when proved at room temperature over shorter durations.  </p>

<p>All I want is to produce similar results except the bread holds its shape more and produce a taller. Any tips?</p>

<p>As my partner and I only eat one loaf per week it's a slow trial and error process varying hydration and watching for expansion.   </p>
",99110,22-05-2019 13:23,How to keep a high hydration bread loaf from becoming flat,"<p>Yesterday, I made a sourdough loaf with a high hydration (80%) and as usual, when I turned it out of its banneton, it simply couldn't hold its shape and became very flat; only about 1 1/2 inches at the highest point.</p>

<p>The recipe follows:
Sponge:
50g water
50g spelt flour
100g starter (100% hydration)</p>

<p>Sponge
344g water
230g whole meal spelt flour
230g strong white flour</p>

<ol>
<li>Mix together ingredients for sponge; ferment overnight in fridge.</li>
<li>Mix water, flours and sponge together and knead until elastic.</li>
<li>Rise until it becomes 1 1/2 its original size.</li>
<li>Shape into a boule (for surface tension) and place in floured banneton.</li>
<li>Rise until doubled; turn out and bake.</li>
</ol>

"Problems with frying chicken...coating doesnt stick, and coating doesnt get crispy","<p>Ive been trying to fry chicken in oil, but im running into issues with the coating.</p>

<p>Ive tried using a pre-made coating mix and flour. I coat the chicken in egg (which is supposed to help the coating to stick) then coat the chicken in the coating. But the coating struggles to stick to the chicken and falls off when i flip the chicken over. It also hardens and turns into solid pieces that stick to the bowl and which i cant use, which is a waste of the coating.</p>

<p>The coating doesnt get really crispy when I fry the chicken in oil either. It only gets mildly crispy, not like the crunchy type you get in restaurants or KFC's hot n spicy chicken.</p>

<p>The flour does get somewhat crunchier when fried though, compared to using the coating mix only.</p>

<p>Does anyone know why the coating mix/flour is struggling to stick to the chicken (even when I coat the chicken in egg first) and why its not getting really crispy?</p>

<p>Edit : Just tried to fry chicken again, didnt use egg this time. The coating didnt turn into hard pieces, but the coating didnt stick to the chicken. The flour/coating also mostly dissolved upon contact with the oil. Not sure what im doing wrong.</p>

<p>The recipe basically leaves out the butter until the very end when the dough is fully mixed and hydrated. Only then does the recipe require the butter to be slowly added into the dough tablespoons at a time using a wooden spoon.</p>

<p>I am usually used to creaming the butter at the very beginning or using melted butter in the wet ingredients and then mixing it with the dry ingredients. Incorporating the butter into the dough at the end using a wooden spoon took quite a while and was a pretty good workout for my arms. </p>

<p>I took a look at other Brioche recipes on the internet and pretty much all of them add the butter into the dough at the very end. </p>

<p><strong>So my question is why is the butter incorporated only after the dough is fully formed?</strong> </p>

<p><strong>What would happen if I were to cream the butter with the sugar(small amount of it) and egg at the beginning before adding it to the sponge and dry ingredients?</strong></p>

How to keep the bottom of my bread from getting burned?,"<p>I have been experimenting with making whole grain sourdough bread at home. My current recipe is for a loaf that is about 4 cups of flour total, not counting sourdough starter, evenly split between bread flour, whole wheat, and dark rye. After preparation and rising, I cook in a dutch oven, with the dough shaped like a long cylinder stretching from one side of the dutch oven to the other, so that it rises into a loaf shape. Cook time is 30 mins with the lid on, then 5 mins uncovered; at 500 F in a conventional oven. After cook time, I immediately take the loaf out of the dutch oven and let it cool on the counter. </p>

<p>This creates a pretty satisfactory loaf of bread; simple to make, tasty enough,  cooked all the way through with a nice crust on the outside. My only issue is that it ""burns"" on the bottom where the loaf is in contact with the dutch oven. The loaf is slightly blackened on bottom, though that is mostly a cosmetic issue, there is no burnt toast flavor. However, the bottom 1/4 inch of the loaf is very tough and hard to cut when slicing. </p>

<p>I've tried varying cook times and haven't be able to solve this burning problem. What are some tactics that might allow my loaf to cook the same way on the crust and insides, but not burn the bottom as much?</p>
",100383,26-07-2019 14:37,Dutch oven bread - bottom always burns,"<p>When I bake bread in my dutch oven, to get the bread crust a darker brown and where it should be, the bottom will burn.

<p>The recipes always call for a pre-heat of 475F before the bread goes in, 25-30 top on 15-20 top off. I'm trying to adjust the temperature now, but I don't see how this isn't a more common problem. Any suggestions for this? </p>

<a href=""https://recipes.anovaculinary.com/recipe/sous-vide-bbq-pork-shoulder"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://recipes.anovaculinary.com/recipe/sous-vide-bbq-pork-shoulder</a></p>

<p>My bag had no or very little air in it after sealing and when the cooking started. Since cooking for a few hours the meat has shrunk considerably in size within the bag. But the bag also has new air in it. Enough to make it float. </p>

<p>I am worried I could have bad bacteria and make my guests sick. </p>

<p>Here is more of my thoughts:
1) According to some articles I have read this could simply be vapor. At 165F the meat is hot enough to release some water to vapor. 
2) Maybe while coming to temperature some bacteria did grow, but at 165F, that bacteria is now dead. Even though the air remains, the meat is safe to eat. The dead bacteria and/or their waste are not harmful. 
3) I grew a bunch of bacteria and this is not safe to eat. </p>

Paper towel gets completely dark after I wipe my Dutch oven,"<p>I bought Lodge cast iron dutch oven a few weeks ago. I didn't season it right away since I kept it in a dry closet. Last week seasoned it with pure almond oil (because I read it somewhere it's slightly better than other oils) and an hour in the oven (500F). After I cooked with it, nothing was wrong with the food. Then I rinsed it with hot water and wiped with paper towel, and the paper towel got completely dark, and it didn't seem like the oil I used for the food. </p>

<p>So my question is: Is it normal ? Should I reseason it ? I thought maybe I should've done the seasoning for a couple more times instead of once, or I used too much oil for the seasoning. </p>

Seasoning carbon steel wok,"<p>Can a new unseasoned carbon steel wok be seasoned after one use (used it for steaming)?
It now has some rust on it. Can it be salvaged?</p>
",102278,11-09-2019 23:47,Is there any way to salvage an old rusted wok?,"<p>Hello Seasoned Advice: I cannot find an answer on any previous posts here relating to woks about what to do if the wok is Already Rusted. I found this wok in my husband's house when I moved in - he has no idea where it came from or how long it's been there.  I have no information about this wok, other than that the faded manufacturer's label indicates it was made in Taiwan, presumably by an Asian cooking supply house - has Chinese (?) characters above, then in English: ""Seven S---G Co., Ltd"" (the --- indicates where the label is faded and illegible) with an address, international phone number and fax number. It is black, has a welded, hollow steel handle with a hole through it for hanging, and looks to be a commercial, or restaurant-grade wok of carbon steel, well used. It was stored in an under-counter cabinet next to a leaky sink, so I have no doubt about where the original rust came from. Has about 10 small pits on the bottom and almost half of the entire upper right side of the circumference of the wok is almost one continuous thin (not pitted) area of rust.</p>

<p>Previously, I had spent the better part of a day alternately: scrubbing the rust (with coarse salt and fine salt), wiping with vegetable oil and heating over a high gas flame -then repeating this process 3 or 4 times until I was sure there was no rust or moisture remaining (although it is still pitted in some places at the bottom), and then another thin coat of oil to seal against moisture, heated again, then wiped. It worked very well for a couple of weeks, but as I don't currently cook Asian-style on a regular basis, after a few weeks of disuse it turned rusty again, almost worse than when I found it. </p>

<p>Should I be using steel wool to scrub the rust down to bare steel first, or just the salt? Using a different oil? (WD-40?  Just Kidding). Oven vs Gas burner heating?  How should I be storing this? (I have limited space-so most of my equipment is hanging on the walls or on a steel kitchen shelving rack, so I don't think air-flow is an issue.)</p>

Omelette stuck to pot on low fire with extra virgin olive oil,"<p>I've tried to cook an egg with some oil underneath on low fire, trying to make an omelette, but the egg still got stuck and when I turned it over a plate it collapsed apart. It was just some egg and hard cheese bits. Anyone know what went wrong?</p>

<p>Maybe it's because the small pot was not nonstick. I thought it would turn out ok anyways.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
",102282,12-09-2019 10:27,Trouble frying an egg on a stainless steel pan,"<p>I recently purchased a stainless steel pan from AllClad, but I'm struggling to use it. Food, and in particular eggs, seem to stick readily to the pan, making it hard to use. There is a question on Seasoned Advice that pertains to cooking an omelette on a stainless steel pan, but I think the challenges of frying an egg are different and more challenging. I've been able to cook an omelette in this pan, but have yet to succeed with a fried egg.</p>

<p>Looking online, I learned that stainless steel pans, like cast-iron, need to be seasoned in order to be non-stick. The process that I followed to season my pan was as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pour in 1/4 cup walnut oil. </li>
<li>Heat pan on medium heat until the oil begins to smoke.</li>
<li>Turn heat off and let the pan cool completely.</li>
<li>Remove the oil and wipe the pan dry.</li>
</ol>

<p>I tried this process, but when I try to fry an egg in the pan, it still sticks readily. There is some improvement, but it is still not possible to cook an egg without sticking that destroys the egg in the end.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what I may be doing wrong, or is a stainless steel pan just not something that one can use for frying eggs? Should I just expect that there will be some stick whenever I use this pan?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>After watching <a href=""https://rouxbe.com/cooking-school/how-to-pan-fry/details"" rel=""noreferrer"">this short course on pay frying</a>, I tried to pre-heat my pan, using the water-test as a guide, and adding just a bit of oil to the pan before dropping the egg in. The results were the same. The egg stuck to the pan thoroughly. So again I'm not sure what I'm doing incorrectly. Maybe the oil I'm using isn't right? I've been using ghee.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>:</p>

<p>I've yet to succeed in frying a egg on this pan, but a few additional questions/issues have surfaced:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Some answers here have suggested that despite the presence on the web of tutorials for ""seasoning"" stainless steel pan this is not necessary and may not be advisable.</p></li>
<li><p>The trick may be to fry the egg starting at a much lower heat then you might with something like a piece of meat. For meat, you often encounter the suggestion to use the ""water test"", but as at least one answer has suggested here that may not work with a fried egg. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>These are the possibly insights I've gleaned so far, but I've also yet to succeed, so these may turn out to be wrong as well.</p>

<p><strong>Satisfying Answer (May be others)</strong></p>

<p>The solution that I have settled on here -- i.e. what finally worked for me -- was to work with lower heat than I thought was needed, and not to season the pan. There is definitely a lot of conflicting information out there about stainless steel pans. There are a great number of blog posts and YouTube videos that talk about how to season a pan. Seasoning may still be a useful thing to do, but I was able to fry an egg on an unseasoned pan finally.</p>

<p>The method I used is more or less as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Clean pan thoroughly.</p></li>
<li><p>Take egg out of refrigerator and let it sit in warm water for five minutes or so. (This may not be necessary.)</p></li>
<li><p>Put pan on stove on medium flame/heat. (I only tried this on a gas stove.)</p></li>
<li><p>Let pan pre-heat until it is warm when you hold your hands over the pan. Warm, not hot! This might take 20-30 seconds, maybe less. </p></li>
<li><p>Add the oil (1-2 tbsp), and lower the flame to low. Let the oil heat a bit, perhaps another 10-15 seconds, or less.</p></li>
<li><p>Crack the egg into the pan. The whites should stay clear, only slowly whitening. If the egg begins to turn white immediately, the pan is too hot. And the egg should also not stick at this point. There may be a bit of sticking, especially around the edges. You can dislodge the sticking gently by hand, but don't mess with the egg too much. Cook until done or ready to flip. Make sure heat stays low. If you see some sticking it may be (I'm not sure about this) because the pan has become too hot.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So that's the best I've been able to do with help from the selected answer.</p>

Soaked chick peas (overnight) smell like sour milk,"<p>I put chickpeas in cold water last night and let them soak overnight, at room temperature, about 14-16 hours total. Today when I took the cover off, there was white foam on top of the water. I dumped the beans in a colander and got a whiff of a really strong, foul odor, like sour milk or a strong cheese. I know beans can sometimes smell funky, but this was something else.</p>

<p>The beans themselves looked fine and normal, but it took a lot of rinsing to get rid of that bad smell. Is this normal? I rarely soak my beans and I don't think I've ever soaked chick peas, so I haven't encountered this before.</p>

<p>This might be important: I did not rinse them before soaking. I just put them in a pot, filled it with cold water, and set it on the counter to soak. Could that be the reason they smelled so bad after the soak? Are they OK to eat? Or should I throw them out and start over with different chick peas? Thanks.</p>

<ol>
<li>A human hair</li>
<li>Some sand</li>
<li>Some white dots (presumably parts of a plant) that always come with Pu'er stones and float on the surface</li>
<li>Parts of other plants or a trunk parts of the tea plant that was not meant for tea</li>

</ol>

<p>Finding the fluff finally got me and I decided to ask here.</p>

<p>Is it normal for tea to contain various inclusions like that? I understand that tea processing is a complex process performed by humans at factories in huge batches. So is it common for something like that to get into the process?</p>

<p>I ask because, for example, if you consider some kind of grain, there are often inclusions of other things (other grains or something else) too, and this is known and normal for lower quality (cheaper) grain. You don't throw away the pack if there are some other kind of grains and you simply remove them. Various manufacturers differ in quality and you can choose. You know that the more expensive grain should be better processed and have no inclusions, when a cheaper one is ok to have them. Now this is not the case with the Chinese tea. There's no (obvious) choice of the manufacturer, it simply comes from a particular part of China. I can only choose a local vendor and which tea grade to buy (where tea grade tells what part of the tea plant was used in the making, and nothing more, not the quality of the manufacturing).</p>

<p>I have started drinking Chinese tea not so long ago, and I don't have much experience of it. So my question is: are the inclusions that I have described above common and known for tea, or should I consider buying at a different store, from a different vendor? If the tea is coming from China, will it be different, or is it the same in all the shops? What would you do in a situation like this?</p>

<p>Even a high-level book such as Thomas Keller's <em>The French Laundry Cookbook</em> boasts that <em>""all [recipes] have been thoroughly tested in home kitchens""</em>.</p>

Books which actually document the way a restaurant chef would prepare and cook their own food every day.</p>

preseasoned pan - now blackened and chipping,"<p>While I've found similar posts, I have not found a perfect answer and thought I'd share my cleaning routine in case that is creating a problem.  I purchased a pre-seasoned Lodge skillet about a year ago. I also have my Grandmothers old Wagner that looked to be well seasoned as well.<br>
My issue is that the Lodge currently is fairly lumpy on the bottom and food will pick up quite a few black flakes.  I've tried taking a spatula to it to try to pick up some of it and then wiping it, but it doesn't get much of it.  I think when the pan is hot more comes off.
My cleaning routine is this:  After using pan, I boil hot water in it to pick up any of the baked on food.  I ""scrape"" it as it's boiling with a wooden spatula.  Then dump the hot water and rinse with just plain water wiping it dry with a paper towel.  I then will add a little oil (either grape-seed or regular olive oil) and wipe that around the entire pan with a paper towel.  Then putting the pan back on the hot burner to ""cure"".   All along I've thought of this as a mini curing session each time I use it which is a lot.  But maybe it's too much somehow?  Or maybe the boiling of the water in it after use is too much?  I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.  I do the same thing with all of my cast iron pans and I have varying degrees of ""not smooth"" bottoms.  Including the Wagner.  Please help!  I definitely do not have that baby smooth surface like others speak of.  Thanks in advance! </p>
",103544,17-11-2019 23:20,Cast iron pan has black residue on it,"<p>I have a small cast iron pan which I am working with, trying to make sure I understand seasoning/cleaning before moving on to a larger one. I seasoned with flaxseed oil (4 light coats, hour in the oven), and have cooked a few things - I made some Ghee, fried some onions, stuff like that. After each I washed with hot water (no soap), heated until dry on the stove and coated with a thin layer of canola oil.</p>

<p>Now, when I take a dry paper towel and rub it on the pan, a black residue shows up on the paper towel. I can't feel anything with my fingers and I haven't noticed anything cooking with it. I'm fairly confident this occurred <em>after</em> the initial seasoning - although I'm not sure I did this exact test with the paper towel.</p>

<p>Is this a) normal, or b) what is wrong and c) how can I fix it?</p>

<p>There are quite a few questions (and good answers!) regarding cast iron cookware on this site but I haven't been able to find one that deals with this specific issue.</p>

Are there advantages of soaking rice overnight as opposed to only for 30 minutes?,"<p>All these years I've just washed rice, put it into a pressure cooker (a regular pressure cooker; not a rice cooker), added the right amount of water and cooked it until the first whistle. Both for brown rice and white rice.  </p>

<p>But when looking up this page on <a href=""https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/how-to-cook-rice-in-a-pot-pan-stove/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Basmati rice</a>, the author does two things differently.<br>
1. She pre-soaks the rice for 30 minutes.<br>
2. She brings the water to a boil before adding the rice to it.  </p>

<p>On searching for more info, <a href=""https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/08/cooking-rice-incorrectly-could-endangering-health/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this site</a> and <a href=""https://green-mom.com/benefits-soaking-rice/#.Xdo-kKhS90s"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this site</a> recommend soaking rice overnight! This completely perplexed me. </p>

<p>Assuming that I want to cook my rice with soaking, how do I choose between soaking for 30 minutes and overnight? Is soaking overnight a safety concern? Is it better to soak it overnight in the fridge? Wont an overnight soaking make it absorb a lot of water and make it less suitable for cooking in a pressure cooker?   </p>
",103669,24-11-2019 08:38,Effect of rice cooking techniques,"<p>I rarely ate rice growing up, and only recently started cooking it. I started with basmati, and seemed to do alright with that, but my wife (who used to live in Korea) said she preferred rice to clump together, as opposed to the perfect individual grains of a nicely cooked basmati.</p>

<p>Well, as embarrassed as I am to say so, I've been struggling with this two-ingredient dish. I've tried using short-grain rice, which helped somewhat, but using my basmati technique on it is not yielding the desired result. </p>

<p>After doing some research, I've found a slew of conflicting advice, on nearly every point, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wash / don't wash</li>
<li>Soak / don't soak</li>
<li>Use less / more water</li>
<li>Boil hard / steam on lowest setting</li>

Calculating the effect of a marinade on nutrition,"<p>While watching a collection of <a href=""http://www.myrecipes.com/well-done/how-to-make-4-chicken-marinades"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">olive oil based chicken marinade recipes</a> <em>I was wondering if there is an effective way of calculating the effect that a marinade might have on the nutritional value of meat being marinaded?</em> While I am principally interested in 'calories' I would also like to, for instance, be able to calculate differences in fats and/or carbs. I am not so interested (at the moment) about vitamins or minerals.</p>

<p>The tools I have seen simply aggregate the total of ingredients, but in a marinade many of those ingredients are left behind (and therefore should not count as calories for the dish) but I have to believe (and other articles suggest as much) that there is 'an effect' but I am yet to find a manner for calculating that effect.</p>

<p>Several answers to <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/66/6279"">How to calculate the calorie content of cooked food?</a> dance around the question, and as @Bikerboy389 suggests, maybe I'm ""<em>sweating the small stuff</em>"" here...still I would like to know.

How to not make my macarons rip?,"<p>I just made a batch of macarons. This is my third total batch of them, and they become increasingly better - alas compared to my previous batch, these don't show much if any improvement even though I've changed how much I mix the macaron mass and how I pipe them.</p>

<p><em>Recipe</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>~150g egg-whites<br>
  ~70g finest sugar (not powdered!)<br>
  Mix with an older Kenwood chef until stiff and glossy<br>
  1 very flat teaspoon of vanilla extract (so about half a deep spoon)<br>
  ~3g of powdered green food coloring<br>
  More mixing with the Kenwood until well mixed, still stiff and glossy  </p>
  
  <p>~150g sifted almond meal<br>
  ~250g sifted powdered sugar<br>
  pinch of salt<br>
  Mix well   </p>
  
  <p>Mix the almond/sugar stuff into the egg-whites using a rubber spatula until the consistence allows me to pour a figure-eight without globs breaking off  </p>
  
  <p>Pipe onto trays, let sit some 10-15min and rap every ~5min (rap 4 times, turning tray 90 deg after a few hits/raps)  </p>
  
  <p>Bake for 20min, middle height of oven<sup>1</sup>, at 150C</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first tray went into the oven as soon as the latter hit 150C:

<p>The second tray had to wait for some ~20min while the other baked, during that time I rapped it a few times more but mostly let it sit:

<p><strong>What can I do to prevent my macarons cracking / how to change my recipe and/or process?</strong></p>

<p>I see that there are positive results by letting them sit for more time, so I'm thinking about letting them sit ~1 hour next time I make a batch, and def rap them every 15min or so. <strong>What other changes/improvements should I make to my recipe?</strong></p>

<p>They all cracked on top and the surface collapsed as you see in the picture. I did some research and watched youtube videos to find out what I am doing wrong. As I figured the following factor could be the reason behind ugly macaroons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I read somewhere that the time you let the batch sit and dry before putting i the oven is an important factor. I let it rest for 45 minutes to one hour instead of 20-30 minutes, but the result was the same, if not worse.</p></li>
<li><p>The other factor is beating egg whites to stiff peaks. There, I think this is where my problem come from. So I beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt to medium peak stage, then add in the sugar in 3 batches while mixing with hand mixer. After watching several videos I know what stiff peaks look like, or at least I think so. But trying the recipe keeping that point in mind it still had the same result: </p></li>

How to reduce sugar in chocolate chip cookies without losing the texture,"<p>I have my chocolate chip cookie recipe which uses a 1 to 1 sugar to flour ratio. The texture is chewy because I under-cook them on purpose. When cooked golden brown they are snappy like the supermarket chocolate chip cookies. (like pepperidge farm)</p>

<p>I'm trying to reduce the sugar in this recipe for taste and health reason. (I know that chocolate chip cookies are not celery and carrots :D )</p>

<p>I reduced the sugar to reach a ratio of 75% sugar to flour ratio. The cookies need more cooking time, and come out bready/cakey.</p>

<p>Here is the final low-sugar recipe for reference (my original recipe is based on the one on the back of the Tollhouse chocolate chip packages):</p>

<ul>
<li>250g butter</li>
<li>110g granulated sugar</li>
<li>100g brown sugar</li>
<li>1 pack vanilla sugar</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1 pack of baking soda</li>
<li>1 pinch of salt</li>
<li>270g flour</li>
<li>300g chocolate chips</li>
<li>Bake 12 minutes at 190°C</li>
</ul>

<p>My understanding is that the sugar contributes to some kind of caramelization of the cookie, making it chewy/snappy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If it were true, it may make for a somewhat better tasting tomato, and perhaps a better texture, as well. Still, it’s hard to say how much difference it would really make, these days, as other factors have conspired to make the modern (i.e. not heirloom) tomato less delicious than its predecessors. But, tomatoes on the vine, or cluster tomatoes, are NOT picked ripe. They are picked a few days later than conventional tomatoes, they are still allowed to do most of their ripening after they are picked “still on the vine.” Like individually picked tomatoes, they may be force-ripened at a regional facility, or they may ripen in storage, during transport, or at the grocery store. This few extra days on the plant may make some difference in flavor but I doubt it makes a big difference, and certainly, in my subjective experience, it does not. However, you will pay extra for these tomatoes, and it may not be worth the extra cost.</p>
  
  <p>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</p>
  
  <p>You may not think ripening a tomato on the vine makes a difference in taste, or you may steadfastly maintain that it makes all the difference in the world. But I would guess that, regardless, you would not want to pay extra for a tomato that is labelled to <em>appear</em> as if it is ripened in the field. The reality is that it is very impractical for the tomato industry to pick tomatoes ripe. Many ripe fruits and vegetables hold up fine during shipping, but ripe tomatoes do not. They’re skins will split, they will turn to mush, and they may even be infested with fruit flies.</p>

Different ways of making soy milk and how it affects tofu,"<h2>Story:</h2>

<p>I have been trying to make soy tofu from home made soy milk with little success till today. </p>

<p>Usually I soak the soy beans overnight and boil them, then grind it to squeeze the milk out. The milk I got from this method tasted very good to drink without the strong ""Soy flavor"". But when I tried to make tofu from this milk, the size of the coagulant particles were so small that it could not be separated from the water. When stood, it appears to be coagulated with small particles floating but when the vessel is disturbed, the particles break up and it could never be filtered let alone pressed.</p>

<p>I suspected the cause to be boiling the beans before grinding them. So I made a batch of soy milk in which I ground the soaked beans and filtered the raw milk before boiling the milk. Now when the coagulant (Epsom salt) was added, the milk immediately coagulated into huge chunks and I was able to make tofu.</p>

<h2>Question:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Why does the milk obtained from boiled beans does not coagulate as good as the milk obtained from raw soaked beans (which is then finally boiled anyway)?</li>
<li>What are the factors that affect coagulation of soy milk to soy curd?</li>
<li>Is there any way we can remove the ""Beany"" taste from the milk made using the second method?</li>
</ol>
",104692,12-01-2020 10:34,Soymilk for drinking vs. soymilk for tofu making,"<p><strong>Many recipes for tofu start from soymilk, many others start from scratch, but most of either kind share a whole variety of approaches</strong>, i.e. the order of the soaking, boiling and blending operations, the duration of the soak, the length of the milk cooking/simmering, whether the milk should be strained before simmering or the other way around. Recipes for drinking soymilk vary on a similar fashion, apart from the fact that they aim to remove the so-called ""beany flavor"" that seems to be haunting homemakers.</p>

<p><strong>Assuming the invariance of the final product</strong> in terms of flavor, firmness, coagulation etc. <strong>there are some choices that result in consistent operational advantages</strong>, such as the boil-and-blend method which leaves out the discomforts of the soak, or the option of straining the milk <em>before</em> the simmer so that all you have to do to get to the coagulant insertion is wait for it to come down to temperature.</p>

<p><strong>My question now is: can we make such an assumption?</strong> Some other sources suggest for example that a soaking time longer than eight hours inhibits the soymilk's ability to coagulate properly, but others point out that it would yield a better drink. Same goes for simmering time, let alone all other variables and orderings I briefly listed above.</p>

<p>I tried making tofu twice using a combo lemon juice and salt as a coagulant, but the results were ricotta-like and silken tofu, while I strive for firm to extra-firm. I mostly blame it on my previous lack of a cooking thermometer which I just purchased specifically (together with some <em>nigari</em> crystals) for this purpose, so I thought I should ask if there are other parameters I might be leaving out of the investigation.</p>

"Keeping cooked pasta, chicken, beef, shrimp, and rice edible for at least 5 days","<p>I am trying to meal prep for the work week.

<p>My meals are as follows: brown rice with veggies and some meat, wholewheat pasta with some meat, wholewheat tortilla tacos with some meat, and a lean veggie soup base (veggies with broth). Each of the meals may be supplemented by some extra roasted potatoes. All of the meals also include some veggies (onion, bell pepper, spinach, etc)</p>

<p>1) If I make the individual meals on Sunday, and the meals contain brown rice/wholewheat pasta with some meat like chicken/shrimp/flank steak and veggies, can i immediately freeze the meals in the tupperware? Will this taste good if I thaw them 4 days later and reheat them?</p>

<p>2) Let's say I don't freeze anything. Then can cooked pasta/brown rice last for 5-6 days? I read online that chicken/meats in general only last about 3 days before they spoil/taste bad. But it would save me a lot of time if I cooked the pasta/rice in advance and just cooked the meats/veggies on wednesdays.</p>

<p>3) how long can cooked veggies last in the fridge? I make veggie soup as part of my meals, so can that last for 5 days if needed?</p>

<p>Sorry for the long list of questions. Mainly I am trying to figure out what is the best way of prepping this stuff. An ideal solution for me would be cooking all 10 meals (5 days x 2 meals for lunch and dinner) in one day and then preserving the taste of the meals that will be eaten on thursday/friday.</p>

Reheating potentially unsafe canned goods unsafe?,"<p>I am into home brewing and one of the popular practices is for people to can wort - this is basically a sugary barley like tea- for growing yeast. A lot of people simply can wort in a pressure cooker or via normal steam canning methods, but after reading about the time variations necessary to can certain foods, and after failing to find a specific time recipe for wort even after emailing a government body asking for recommendations, I reached the conclusion that I did not need edible wort out of a can.</p>

<p>Instead I could just boil the wort once out of the can to kill any potential botulism toxin and still have the ability to portion large batches of wort into cans. The question is this: is there anything that won't be killed off in the boil that I need to worry about? After all, even though this is for yeast growth, I will end up drinking a small amount as it will end up in my beer.</p>

"I removed some of the black metallic covering of my pan, is it still safe to use?","<p>I have a Seagull ""4 star"" ""Marathon"" ""non-stick cookware"" pan.<br>
I have decoated much of the black metallic coating of that pan with a <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=stainless%20metallic%20scotch%20brite&amp;rlz=1C1CHBD_enTH852TH852&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNTFLIZwK9kLunVh2doHvbJ0UhiBXQ:1579958962840&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjpnPXl7Z7nAhX073MBHetIBHYQ_AUoAXoECA0QAw&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=722"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">stainless metallic scotch brite</a>.</p>

<h2>My problem</h2>

<p>First, I am not sure it is still safe to use and second, after removal, one might be able to see a new, even bigger such black ""carbonated"" stain, appearing around the newly exposed metal.</p>

<h2>My question</h2>

<p>I removed some of the black metallic covering the pan (and now one part of the metal is exposed and another became blacker → <code>matt black</code>), is it still safe to use?</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I tried to pour some well refined sunflower oil and heat it, then most of the uncovered metallic part became yellow (I have no idea how to explain it); this yellowishness didn't come down with a napkin → why wouldn't it?</p>

Cooked ham left out overnight,"<p>I forgot to put the rest of the ham we ate for dinner in the fridge last night and didn't realize it until this morning. Heat wasn't on but it was probably around 57-60 degrees overnight. If I pressure cook the leftover ham with some beans, how big a chance would I be taking in eating it? I know pressure cooking should kill the bacteria, but I don't know how many toxins would have already been produced.</p>

<p>Just the let you know where I'm coming from, we typically eat things in our house that others would prob throw out for safety's sake (foods past their dates or left out a little longer than they should have been).</p>

<p>Apparently my question is too close to other questions. I would say the difference lies in two parts. One, I am planning to pressure cook the food in question which should kill the bacteria in the food. So my main question is about the toxins produced by the bacteria. And two, I am asking for an opinion, not a reiteration of food safety guidelines. As stated, our family often breaks food safety guidelines when we do not see a significant chance of it actually causing us problems.</p>

  <p>Let the clams sit for 20 minutes to an hour. During this time, they will spit out the sand from inside their shells.</p>
  
  <p>When you’re ready to cook, lift each clam from the water and scrub it to clean any particles or grit from the outside surface. It’s better to lift them individually because straining them into a colander would dump the sand back on top.</p>

Sourdough bread crumb ripped in two,"<p>I've been trying my hand at sourdough bread for a few months now and it is getting better and better, but this keeps happening, and I have no idea what might be the cause:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jlMsD.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jlMsD.jpg"" alt=""Enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>My impression is that during the rise, the crumb tears into two pieces in the middle.</p>

<p>This is probably relevant: The dough is 80% hydration white bread flour, around 3 hours autolysis, then lamination and three stretches and folds spaced out. Altogether around six hours of bulk fermentation, overnight in the fridge (5&nbsp;°C), and baked in the morning on a pizza stone, with 250&nbsp;°C with steam for 20 minutes and 220&nbsp;°C for 20 minutes (the oven has the air convection turned on).</p>

<p>My problem is I have no idea which part of the recipe is to blame for the outcome, so I'm not even sure where I am deviating from the recipe I'm trying to copy (to be very exact, I'm trying to follow this one now: <em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJEjW-QSnQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">How To Make A Basic Open Crumb Sourdough Bread</a></em>)</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this is important, but it also doesn't open up so well (but I don't have a proper lame, so I'm struggling with the scoring):</p>

<p>Before shaping, I have been degassing my dough using the King Arthur Flour recommended technique of folding the dough over itself a few times.

<p>Is it possible that I am over-proofing the dough before putting it in the oven? Or is it my shaping technique?</p>

Some beans are not cooked,"<p>I am cooking beans <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigna_mungo"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Vigna mungo</a>  , after soaking beans in water overnight. </p>

<p>I realized that when i cooked them in morning for 20 minutes in pressure cook, there are very few beans are still as hard as uncooked soaked beans, why these few exceptional beans are not softened ?</p>
",107542,13-04-2020 17:09,Baked beans still firm after soaking and hours of cooking,"<p>I decided I would make baked beans for a BBQ at my MIL's this past weekend. I've never made baked beans but decided that it was time since I love them so much! I found a recipe for Southern Baked Beans (using Navy beans). It was from a food blog. </p>

<p>During the description/commentary of the dish the blogger said they could be made with dried beans but she uses canned to save time. The recipe only mentioned canned beans. I couldn't find anything to tell me the ratio canned:dried beans so I decide a 1:1 ratio would be good. After putting a 24oz bag of beans in a cake pan (the recipe called for 32oz canned beans), I decided that was A LOT of beans so didn't add the remaining 8oz. I rinsed them first then soaked them for 15-18 hours. I rinsed them again and put them in a pot with the rest of the ingredients. </p>

<p>The recipe said to bake them at 350 for about 40 minutes and they should be done. After an hour and a temperature increase to 400, the beans weren't anywhere close to being done. At this point I decided they were probably very old beans. :( I moved them to the stove after another 30 minutes. They boiled on the stove for another 1 1/2 hours and were still rock hard (I kept adding water so they wouldn't boil dry - and this was on medium to medium-low heat). </p>

<p>We left the beans at my MIL's and she cooked them ""off and on"" (her words) the next day and declared they were done. They are not done. :(</p>

<p>Now that they've been cooked then refrigerated then cooked then refrigerated again, can I attempt to salvage them? I've read that adding 1/8 tsp baking soda per cup of beans will soften them. Is it too late to try this - add the beans, more water, and a small amount of baking soda and cook them a little more? I've put so much effort into these stupid beans I can't just give up! LOL</p>

Invariably they are able to crack the coconut nearly perfectly in half. I can't. I always end up with little pieces of coconut meat tightly fixed on shell. I can't hammer these pieces if I want my fingers intact -- actually I did try it once with an oven mitt, results were not great. Anything I can do to get the shell off the meat other than prying away with a knife?</p>

How to remove an improper seasoning?,"<p>I bought the Ikea Vargaden iron skillet. The instructions said to season the pre-seasoned skillet with my oil of choice (i used canola oil) and heat it for a finish. </p>

<p>I made the mistake of not wiping off the excess oil so the skillet came out of the oven sticky. I tried to soak up the oil with a paper towel then a kitchen towel, and in my idiocy, filled the skillet with tissue residue and fine lint.

<p>A few months back I bought a set of VonShef cast iron pans. When seasoning them, I unfortunately made two errors. First, in my naïveté, I used vegetable oil as the seasoning; and second, I didn't remove the excess oil, leaving a sticky and uneven finish in the pans. After a couple of failed attempts at cooking with this situation, and some food sticking to the pans, I've been putting off using them to avoid further catastrophes.</p>

<p>So how can I go about rectifying my mistakes? I've watched a few videos on YouTube about the proper way of seasoning, and it seems you can clear seasoning by either sanding it down or burning the pan. But how would you also clear off burnt food stuck to the pan?</p>

Safety of Quick-Pickles at Room Temperature,"<p>I just followed a recipe for pickled turnips, but am questioning the step of letting them sit out at room temp for 5 days before refrigerating.</p>

<p>The recipe used:
1 cup white vinegar (5% acidity)
3 cups water
70 grams salt</p>

<p>It's a 1:3 vinegar to water ratio and, if my math is right, has a salinity level of about 7.5% (by weight).</p>

I used a clean, not sterile method, and didn't process the jars. Ten days later some of the jars are cloudy, and some of the lids are fizzing.</p>

<p>I've pickled a lot in the past, sometimes using a water bath to process and sometimes not. This time I skipped the step thinking the acidity would be enough to prevent nasty things like botulism.</p>

<p>I'm belatedly researching and learning the difference between fermented pickles and vinegar pickles. I had simply assumed the process was similar and adding vinegar would keep it safer by increasing the acidity. </p>

<p>My question now is, will the high acidity and high salt (works out to 1 tablespoon per cup of brine) prevent botulism from growing and keep them safe to eat (as long as they don't smell bad)? </p>

<p>Reading about fermented pickles, I see that cloudiness is a good sign. Can the cloudiness be lacto-fermentation, or would the vinegar disrupt that process? </p>

<p>Another thing that might explain the cloudiness is the iodized salt (I didn't have access to pickling salt).</p>

<p>I want to experiment with fermentation and would definitely do things differently next time, but for now, I'm just wondering if I can salvage anything, and what would be a clear indication that they're unsafe and I should throw out the lot.</p>

Short Ribs in for 4-5 hours  </p>

<p>I've had two goes at this, the first time the temperature was closer to 300f, and a bit shorter cooking time.<br>
In both cases, I stuck a toothpick in both parts of meat, and it went in as if the meat was soft and tender.</p>

<p>Basically, what am I doing wrong? Not enough time? Not enough heat?  I worried that I might overcook them and dry them out. So I might try again, but wrap them in foil halfway through...</p>

<p>EDIT: What I did that worked<br>
First of all, it's a shame that I can mark both answers as answers, because they both helped.<br>
What I did was to smoke the ribs at 270-285f for 5.5 hours, and they were bloody perfect.<br>
I started at 270, and opened the bottom vent enough that the temperatures slowly went up to 280 over those 5.5 hours.

"Tea that lingers is more bitter, does it also contain more caffeine?","<p>For convenience, I tend to brew tea in a French press.

<p>I tend to get two to three medium-sized cups from a single press. Unavoidably, because I drink these cups over the course of an hour or so, the last one comes from water that has lingered with the leaves longer and can be quite bitter, sometimes unpleasantly so.</p>

Making my Chicken Madras more savoury,"<p>I have been trying to imitate the gold standard of curries; The British Indian Restaurant (BIR) Chicken Madras and have had some success.</p>
<p>I have made the base-curry sauce as per the books and it works out OK but there is a lot of preparation and the taste is not quite there.</p>
<p>One thing about BIR Madras is that is it always <em>savoury</em>.  When I follow homemade curry recipes I always find that my curry is too sour from the tomato, so I have taken to adding chicken stock (using Knorr cubes) and my curry is starting to approach my goal.</p>
<p>Can anyone suggest ways of making my curry even more savoury?</p>
<p>EDIT: This is my recipe, which won't surprise many people.</p>
<ul>
<li>Marinade chicken breast in yoghurt and lemon for 30 mins in the fridge.</li>
<li>Rinse off marinade and partially fry the chicken and set aside.</li>
<li>Fry onion in Ghee until it starts to brown.</li>
<li>Add garlic and ginger paste.  Wait 2 mins.</li>
<li>Add dried kashmiri chillies.</li>
<li>Stir in spices; coriander powder, cumin, garam masala, hot chilli powder, tumeric and fenugreek powder.  Wait 1 min.</li>
<li>Add 1 mug chicken stock (1 Knorr cube).</li>
<li>Add tomato passata.</li>
<li>Add chicken back in and cook for 15 mins or so.</li>
</ul>

Help?! 2nd thoughts on oven purchase - no non-fan option!,"<p>It occurs to me I’ve never actually bought an oven before! After a fair bit of deliberation I found a Westinghouse in our price range that seems to have good reviews. So we bought it yesterday. Only thing is for some reason it doesn’t seem to have a non-fan option. Isn’t this weird? It’s an electric single oven and functions it has are: Grill, Fan Grill, Defrost, Light, Fan Forced Cooking.</p>
<p>I’ve been cooking on a very old, very basic upright gas oven up until this point. Can’t think of many occasions I’ve used it without the fan, even while baking.</p>
<p>The next option up at the store was an additional $200 with these options: Fan grill, Defrost, Traditional bake, Pizza, Rapid heat, Grill, Fan forced cooking, AirFry and a digital display rather than knobs. Seemed a waste of money given the basic stove I have been using up until now has no options (besides fan), yet I make a wide variety of food in it, including pizzas and baking. I suspected it might be one of those things where the options end up being largely unnecessary.</p>

Are there unwanted effects to simmering vegetables for days?,"<p>Simply put, will continuously simmering vegetables for days, even up to a week or two, in a perpetual stock lead to unexpected or unwanted results?</p>
<p>Since even the longest stock recipes I know don't take more than a day to make, I assume flavour extraction will stop after a few hours but does cooking veggies beyond that point generate off-flavours?</p>
<p>I've also looked up safety concerns of perpetual broths; in this case, since it's a vegetarian one consistently kept at a simmer to which I will regularly add boiling water, I don't think it will be an issue. I'm still new to food-science though so I might have missed something there.</p>

<li>I am not talking about cooking a day or two, I know that this is typically no problem. And yes, if necessary I could add water to counter evaporation. For this question, you may assume ""no time limit"".</li>

How to make authentic black Russian bread?,"<p>I'm trying to re-create the authentic black Russian bread that was first mass produced during soviet times. Nowadays you can find it in any Russian market and many international supermarkets in the US.</p>
<p>The problem is most recipes I can find online either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use a lot of additives such as cacao powder and coffee to color the bread, which don't seem historically plausible</li>
</ol>
<p>or</p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>Don't achieve nearly the same dark shade as the pre-packaged store variants</li>
</ol>
<p>Anecdotally, my dad claims that this bread was sold in the Soviet Union in his youth as the cheapest bread available, for those who couldn't afford bread made from finely milled wheat. At its initial inception it was mass produced by the state and supposedly didn't taste great (although it did have that dark black color). Considering it was the cheapest bread around, it seems highly unlikely it was created with cacao or espresso powder in soviet times.</p>
<p>Eventually, people started prizing this bread more and recipes evolved until we got the modern variant which most people (at least in Russia) find appetizing. It's possible the modern variant uses the more expensive color impacting ingredients, but it seems more likely that some trick that was used to make the original &quot;dirt cheap&quot; black bread is still employed or borrowed from today.</p>
<p>I’ve made a number of different variants following the recipes online and overall I’m happy with the results in terms of taste, but it’s driving me crazy that I can’t figure out how to make the loaf authentically black.</p>

<p>I have/had a beautiful 16"" cast iron dutch oven from Cabelas. I took it out for a test spin the other night (I had completed all seasoning steps that the Google Gods recommended). Then:</p>

<ul>
<li>I tried (and failed spectacularly) to cook a pork roast in it, but cooked it at <strong>way</strong> too hot a temperature and burned/charred/fused the animal fats/juices into the oven, whereby it basically baked into the cast iron (related question <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/71688/how-to-salvage-a-totally-nuked-cast-iron-dutch-oven"">here</a>)</li>
<li>I tried cleaning/scrubbing it with coarse-grained salt -> did nothing</li>
<li>Then I tried cleaning it with dishwashing liquid + salt -> did nothing</li>
<li>Then I let the whole thing soak in a vat of a 50/50 mixture of water + white vinegar -> took all the tarry slude off, stripped some seasoning off (revealing bare iron), but in 80% of the burned/charred areas, still did nothing</li>
<li>Then I went to town on it with a steel wool and salt and dishwashing liquid and was left with some smooth, properly seasoned surfaces, and some more areas stripped down to bare metal</li>
<li>I decided to just re-season it. So I scrubbed it one last time (about 1 hour ago) with a steel wool and some water, got all the rust and remaining crud off (finally), and built a fire.</li>
<li>I placed it on the hot coals of the fire and let it sit there for 15 mins. My <em>intention</em> (whether misled or not) was to burn off all the remaining water from when I had previously washed/scrubbed it, then let it cool off, then season it with oil, and then bake it for a few hours.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I <em>just</em> took the oven off the fire and opened the lid...and the <em>entire</em> inside is covered in rust. An hour ago there was none. When I put the oven into the fire 15 mins prior, there had been none (yes, I checked) This just came out of nowhere.</p>

<p>I'm ready to give up, unless anyone can offer some concrete set of steps for me that will salvage this $100 rust bucket. <strong>How can I get rid of the rust and then re-season this before more rust sets in?</strong> Meh...</p>

How to harvest peppers and tomatoes for later use in sauces without harming taste,"<p>Is there anyway I can pick my peppers and tomatoes now and freeze them immediately for later use to make hot sauces and tomato sauces? I am trying to find the most efficient way to process my pepper and tomato harvest.</p>
<p>The pepper stems and seeds would be removed, the tomatoes would be halved and cores removed before freezing in vacuum bags. Once I have enough peppers and tomatoes, I would thaw them and make hot sauce and tomato sauce respectively. Furthermore, I want to smoke my peppers to make chipotles (for chipotle hot sauce), however it is not really efficient to smoke 2 pounds of peppers every couple of days. I would like to smoke all 20+ pounds of peppers all at once. Its just that 20+ pounds of peppers don't ripen all at once.</p>
<p>I have several pepper varieties I use to make hot sauce and I have a couple different paste tomato varieties to make tomato sauce. I do not have enough peppers and tomatoes to pick right now, but over the next 3-4 weeks I will have over 100 pounds of tomatoes and over 20 pounds of peppers to harvest.</p>
<p>I know the peppers and tomatoes will be soft when thawed, I am worried that the tomatoes may taste sour due to the freeze. I am not sure how the peppers will take the smoke flavor when soft. I was considering dehydrating the ripe peppers as I pick them over the next few weeks. But when I want to smoke them, the dehydrated peppers might not take the smoke flavor. If I had to rehydrate the peppers before smoking, the &quot;waterlogged&quot; peppers might not take the smoke flavor.</p>
<p>I understand the flavor will not be the same as making sauce with fresh produce. It just doesn't make sense to make small sauce batches every 3 days for the next 3-4 weeks.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any suggestions or how I should tackle this feat in a different way that I may not have even considered. There has to be an easier way to accomplish this. If I must freeze the produce, I would greatly prefer to freeze them the same day I harvest versus picking everyday for a week then a big freeze on the weekend. Those peppers I picked on Monday might start to soften by the weekend.</p>
<p>All sauces will be canned and spend 30 minutes in a boiling water bath.</p>

How do I determine roasting temperature as a function of time?,"<p>TL;DR</p>
<p>If it takes 90 minutes to roast a leg of lamb at some temperature (perhaps somewhere from 350 to 450 °F?), and it takes 840 minutes to slow-roast a leg of lamb of the same exact weight at some other temperature (possibly 175 to 275 °F?), what is the temperature setting that one should use if one wants the leg of lamb to spend 420 minutes in the oven? Is it suitable to calculate the temperature using linear interpolation?</p>
<p><em>The mid-length story:</em></p>
<p>The purpose of the question is to avoid the tyranny of recipes, where I have to go to my tablet, computer, or book shelves to do anything. I'd like to understand the ideas (in this case, for roasting lamb or beef) well enough to be able to cook without the handholding of recipe authors.</p>
<p>In this era of internet-sourced recipes, recipes seem to be, by and large, copied, or inspired (possibly even sometimes plain plagiarized). For example, search online for &quot;roast leg of lamb&quot; and you will find a hundred pundits claiming to provide a recipe. Search for &quot;slow roast leg of lamb&quot; and you will find more results. But these recipes are not gospel. We should be able to do anything we want, so long as it's flavorful and healthy. Is there such a thing as semi-slow, average-slow, and rather-fast-than-slow roasting, or are we stuck with just &quot;roasting&quot; and &quot;slow roasting&quot;?</p>
<p><em>The long story:</em></p>
<p>Cooking a whole lamb, starting by <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/110036/85398"">defrosting</a> it, will have to remain a 5- or 10-year project, when I will know that I can nail every detail right, and when I will know that a 40-or-so-large family reunion will happen, if they're ever in the same place at the same time.</p>
<p>At this time I have the much more modest objective of properly cooking a leg of lamb, defrosted for 36 hours in the fridge</p>

<p>and smeared with mustard, rosemary, and garlic</p>

<p>My intention was to leave it in the oven overnight at 275 °F / 135 °C. Slow roasting is much more of a foolproof method, because I don't have to calculate precise minutes-per-weight numbers. If it's in the oven two hours more or an hour less, it's still perfectly alright. (Yes, yes, no need to lecture me about food safety; I do make sure that the internal thermometer reading reaches whatever the thermometer says.)</p>
<p>Here is the problem: I really don't want the flavor, the texture, or, as mentioned above, the time sensitivity of roasting at 375 °F / 190 °C. I would like the fall-off-the-bone tenderness of 275 °F / 135 °C, <em>but</em>.</p>
<p>I was much too tired (tennis for just one hour did it) to think about standing on my feet for the 5-10 minutes that it takes to prepare the roast before going to bed. I'm starting to roast early in the morning instead, for guests who will arrive 420 minutes after the roast went to the oven.</p>
<p>If I need 90 minutes at 375 °F / 190 °C and 840 minutes (14 hours) at 275 °F / 135 °C, I am speculating that there is a precise temperature that I can use for 420 minutes, and the roast will be just perfect when the guests arrive. (Then the roast will rest outside during chatting and appetizers.)</p>
<p><em>How do I determine roasting temperature as a function of time?</em> Would, for example, linear interpolation</p>
<pre><code>375 + (420-90) * (275-375) / (840-90) = 331 °F
</code></pre>
<p>make sense?</p>
<p>N.B.: This might be a difficult question, in the sense that cookbooks do not discuss it. Feel free to &quot;throw me a bone&quot;, figuratively speaking, and make a suggestion that I can try. If the roast is under-cooked, I can always use one of various remedies and apologize that I didn't get it quite right. The guests will be gracious. But if a better answer comes along later, it's fairer, and better fitting for a reference site, that I update the &quot;correct&quot; answer. Cooking is an art form anyway. There isn't just &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;.</p>
",110101,09-08-2020 13:00,Is there a general algorithm for calculating the amount of time to roast meat?,"<p>Often, when you buy meat from the store, it comes with guidance on how long the meat needs to be roasted, presumably calculated as a function of its weight. Is there some well known general algorithm for calculating how long to roast various types of meat (e.g. for display on packaging).</p>
<p>Perhaps something like:
<code>
roasting time = c * weight of meat
</code></p>
<p>Assuming the algorithm is this simple, is there some reference of ideal oven temperatures and scaling constant <code>c</code> for each type of meat (chicken, beef, pork etc)?</p>
<p>Relatedly, is there a well known set of algorithms for converting between say, fan oven, AGA, and/or gas mark standards for oven temperature?</p>
<p>I'm assuming these facts must be well known in meat supplier's product development departments, due to the labeling I see on meat that I buy. However, having Googled it a fair bit, I can't find these details summarized anywhere.</p>
