The Autonumerigram Challenge,"<p>Some phrases both refer to a number, <em>n</em>, and are comprised of <em>n</em> alphabetic characters. I call any such phrase an <strong><em>autonumerigram</em></strong>.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>four</em></strong> has 4 letters</li>
<li><strong><em>seven plus seven</em></strong> has 14 letters</li>
<li><strong><em>fifteen times one</em></strong> has 15 letters</li>
<li><strong><em>one followed by six</em></strong> has 16 letters </li>
<li><strong><em>one before two</em></strong> has 12 letters</li>
<li><strong><em>four before twenty</em></strong> has 16 letters</li>
</ul>

<p>The challenge is to discover the longest and most interesting autonumerigram!</p>

<p>This challenge is open-ended, of course, and I will award the coveted green check to the current longest submission (provided that it's not cheap). I will, however, upvote any interesting submission, regardless of length, so don't be discouraged if you can't discover a long one!</p>

<hr>

<p>Guidelines:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Syntactically, your phrase should be substitutable in ""__ is n"".</strong></p>

<p>For example, all of my above examples fit this context:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>four</em></strong> is 4<br>
  <strong><em>seven plus seven</em></strong> is 14<br>
  <strong><em>fifteen times one</em></strong> is 15<br>
  <strong><em>one followed by six</em></strong> is 16<br>
  <strong><em>one before two</em></strong> is 12<br>
  <strong><em>four before twenty</em></strong> is 16</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Avoid extraneous and cheap additions.</strong></p>

<p>The phrase <strong><em>eight and nine, maybe</em></strong> does have 17 letters, but the <strong><em>maybe</em></strong> is rather extraneous and cheap.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Avoid cheap recursion.</strong></p>

<p>By appending <strong><em>and six</em></strong> to <strong><em>four</em></strong> repeatedly, we can create a phrase for any number of the form <em>6n+4</em>. For example,</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>four and six and six and six</em></strong> has 22 letters</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Strive for human readability and comprehension.</strong></p>

<p>If an autonumerigram is very long but hard for a human to parse, it loses points in my book.
<sub> <em>(Guidelines may be altered or added as the need arises.)</em> </sub></p></li>

<p>Yesterday morning I came to class as usual, and a student came up to me. He said he had a proof that could revolutionize mathematics.</p>

<p>Being a Grade 11 teacher, I didn't believe him.</p>

<p>So I asked him to tell me about the proof, he said <em>""I've divided it into several steps, and said it seemed to work perfectly well, with zero problems.""</em> Then he told me <em>""It's a proof that 1 is equal to 0.""</em></p>

<p>So I asked if he could find any mistakes, he responded <em>""None that I could find, sir, however it wouldn't surprise me if there was. I had thought of it after you taught us factoring. I think you'd like to take a look"".</em></p>

<p>I indeed did, and he showed me, mentioning <em>that it was indeed stating $1=0$.</em></p>

<p>Obviously this is false, and by looking at the paper I noticed his trivial error almost immediately.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assume x and y are two nonzero numbers.<br>
  $x = y$  <br>
  $x^2 = x*y $ <br>
  $x^2 - y^2 = x*y - y^2  $<br>
  $x + y = y  $<br>
  $2*y = y  $<br>
  $2 = 1  $<br>
  $1 = 0$</p>

Is the unexpected hanging paradox really a paradox?,"<p>The unexpected hanging is described in the Wikipedia article <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unexpected_hanging_paradox"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Unexpected hanging paradox</a>.</p>

<p>A hanging is said to be a surprise of on the morning that the prisoner is hanged, he cannot deduce that he will be hanged that day. I don't see the ability to derive a contradiction. If you assume that the judge is telling the truth, then you can deduce that the prisoner won't be hanged any of the days of the week. However, he gets hanged on Wednesday. Since he deduced that he won't get hanged on Wednesday, that must mean he cannot deduce that he will get hanged on Wednesday. Therefore, his hanging on Wednesday was a surprize. However, he also deduced that if he gets hanged on Wednesday, that won't be a surprize. The solution then is to break the assumption that the judge was telling the truth. Since the judge's statement was contradictory, it's totally possible that the prisoner can deduce that he won't be hanged on Wednesday but can also deduce that he will be hanged on Wendesday. Since he can also deduce that he will be hanged on Wednesday, the hanging wasn't a surprize. The judge did not tell the truth that the hanging would be a surprize. That seems like a perfectly good solution to the problem. I see no paradox in that solution.</p>
",84390,27-05-2019 05:30,Unexpected hanging paradox,"<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unexpected_hanging_paradox"">unexpected hanging paradox</a> is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A judge tells a condemned prisoner that he will be hanged at noon on
  one weekday in the following week but that the execution will be a
  surprise to the prisoner. He will not know the day of the hanging
  until the executioner knocks on his cell door at noon that day.</p>
  
  <p>Having reflected on his sentence, the prisoner draws the conclusion
  that he will escape from the hanging. His reasoning is in several
  parts. He begins by concluding that the ""surprise hanging"" can't be on
  Friday, as if he hasn't been hanged by Thursday, there is only one day
  left - and so it won't be a surprise if he's hanged on Friday. Since
  the judge's sentence stipulated that the hanging would be a surprise
  to him, he concludes it cannot occur on Friday.</p>
  
  <p>He then reasons that the surprise hanging cannot be on Thursday
  either, because Friday has already been eliminated and if he hasn't
  been hanged by Wednesday night, the hanging must occur on Thursday,
  making a Thursday hanging not a surprise either. By similar reasoning
  he concludes that the hanging can also not occur on Wednesday, Tuesday
  or Monday. Joyfully he retires to his cell confident that the hanging
  will not occur at all.</p>
  
  <p>The next week, the executioner knocks on the prisoner's door at noon
  on Wednesday — which, despite all the above, was an utter surprise to
  him. Everything the judge said came true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From this I ask:</p>

<ol>
<li>How is it that despite the prisoner's sound logic, the judge is correct just the same?</li>
<li>Assuming the prisoner is a logician, is it even possible for the judge to be wrong?</li>
</ol>

",85443,24-06-2019 10:09,The coolest checkerboard magic trick,"<p>In the small town of Terni (Italy), there's a couple of young friends named Marco and Leonardo, who like to perform magic tricks to a restricted audience of common friends and relatives. They like to call themselves <em>""The prodigious Duo""</em>. Every week-end, The prodigious Duo meets at the house of the leader, which happens to be Marco, to practice new magic tricks, learn new techniques, and, most importantly, to set up the magic show of the week, which will be shown to the audience in the late evening.</p>

<p>Recently, the leader of The prodigious Duo discovered what he claims to be ""the coolest magic trick ever done using a chessboard"" <sup>(which actually is a checkerboard, but that's basically the same thing)</sup>. 
Marco only tested the trick on a $2 \times 2$ squares checkerboard, nonetheless he's certain that the trick would work on any checkerboard with size $n \times n$, where $n$ is a perfect power of two (meaning that the binary logarithm $\log_{2}n$ of $n$ is an integer). 
So <strong>he managed to create a working strategy for a real checkerboard (with $n=8$)</strong>. Once tested the strategy for the bigger board on a piece of paper, Marco is now ready to explain the trick to Leonardo.</p>

<h3>He starts explaining the <em>peculiarities of the checkerboard</em> involved in the trick, since that it isn't a normal checkerboard:</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hXa3A.png"" alt=""Example of the checkerboard""></p>

<ul>
<li><p>""The checkerboard is composed by $8 \times 8$ squares, like a normal one, except that the squares are all red colored, and distinguishable because of the vertical and horizontal lines which define them. This red color choice is only made to avoid confusion when moving the pieces.""</p></li>
<li><p>""The pieces of the checkerboard are normal coin-shaped pieces, except that they're <strong>white on one side and black on the other one</strong>.""</p></li>
<li><p>""The checkerboard is <strong>always visible to all the members of the audience</strong> during the show, and so will be me and you, remember it, this is important.""</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Then he explains <em>the magical trick</em> from the spectators' point of view:</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>""At the beginning of the show, the checkerboard is filled with sixty-four pieces, each one placed inside a different square. <em>The pieces' sides facing up are of mixed color, and their initial color doesn't really matter</em> for the purpose of the trick (e.g. the quantity of black or white pieces doesn't matter).""</p></li>
<li><p>""Once the checkerboard is set up, <em>you will ask for a member of the audience</em> (we'll call him $P$) <em>to come up on the stage to participate in the trick</em>.""</p></li>
<li><p>""Once on the stage, I will cover my eyes and ears with a special mask which will make me unable to see or hear anything around me. Now you'll <strong><em>ask $P$ to rearrange the colors</em></strong> that he sees on the checkerboard flipping any number of pieces he wants, any number of times.""</p></li>
<li><p>""Now you will take a minute or less to <strong><em>look closely and meticulously at the checkerboard's configuration</em></strong>, and then <strong><em>ask $P$ to: choose a piece among the 64 pieces on the board, flip it only one time, and memorize its position</em></strong>.""</p></li>
<li><p>""Once $P$ has done its simple task, you'll do the same thing: you'll carefully <strong><em>choose a piece</strong> (which doesn't necessarily need to be different from the one chosen by $P$), <strong>and flip it one time</em></strong>. At this point, you will lock your head into the same kind of mask I used before, and, once done, ask $P$ to touch me to let me know you cannot see or hear anything.""</p></li>
<li><p>""Felt the touch and removed my mask, <strong><em>I'll reach the checkerboard, carefully observe it for a bit, and finally remove a single piece from it: the piece that has been chosen by $P$.</em></strong>""</p></li>
<li><p>""I'll now help you to remove your mask and bow down with you to the surprisingly cheering audience and the astonished $P$, which is trying to work out what sort of sorcery has been going on moments before.""</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Leonardo takes a minute to elaborate all the information provided to him by Marco, and then, excited, replies: ""This is an incredible magic trick, but man, I mean, sixty-four pieces... how could we ever even think about that? Tell me you've got a solving strategy which is as beautiful as this impressive trick!"". <strong>Marco starts now to explain <em>the real strategy</em> which they are going to apply to recognize the piece chosen by the volunteer on the stage...</strong></p>

<h3>You're asked to discover and explain the strategy which The prodigious Duo is going to apply to find the correct piece chosen by the volunteer.</h3>

<hr>

<h2>Clarifications and notes</h2>

<p>Now, stating some basic facts that might be misunderstood:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>During their show, none of the members of The prodigious Duo can communicate with each other, because of the masks they use to cover their heads.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This means that Marco cannot, in any way, see or listen to what's happening on the stage when the volunteer is mixing up the colors flipping the pieces on the checkerboard.</p></li>
<li><p>And also that Leonardo cannot, in any way, see or listen to what's going on when Marco removes his mask and looks at the checkerboard, revealing the piece chosen by the volunteer.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>No one knows, except for the two magicians, the strategy applied to recognize the piece moved by the volunteer.</p></li>
<li><p>The volunteer called on the stage isn't, in any way, collaborating with the magicians nor cheating; same goes for the rest of the audience.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid stupid answers like ""Marco checks for the fingerprint leaved by the volunteer on the chosen piece"" or similar.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I want to clarify that I didn't think up this puzzle by myself, I only made up some little story-line; I did listen to it years ago talking with some friends of mine, and it randomly came back in my mind recently. For this reason, <strong>I do not know the exact solution of this puzzle</strong> (and this is the main reason why I am asking for a solution here on SE), nonetheless I'm still able to provide additional details and explanations to anyone who asks for them, editing the question itself or answering the comments. <strong>Given that I do not know the real source of this puzzle, it would also be nice if someone could provide it</strong>. Oh, and in case you were wondering: yes, that ""Marco"" is me, ahah.</p>

Some of your students laugh and call it a bluff designed to scare and prevent theft of the treasure hidden in the cave.</p>

<p>You decided to take a chance and take the gem off of the pedestal. As you do, two darts fly out of nowhere, barely missing you, and hit two of your students.

Hunting for treasure in 1-d grid,"<blockquote>
  <p>In a castle, there are N rooms in a line. Each room has a door to the
  two neighbouring rooms (or the one neighbouring room, for the rooms at
  either end). A treasure is hidden in one of the rooms. Each night, you
  can break into one of the rooms and search for the treasure. If you
  break into the right room, you will find it, but otherwise the next
  day the guardian of the castle will move the treasure to an adjacent
  room (they never leave it in the same room, nor move it to a
  non-adjacent room).</p>
  
  <p>Is it possible to guarantee you find the treasure? How many nights do
  you need in the worst case?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could someone give me a pointer or two on how I could solve this? 
I tried breaking the problem into recursive subcases but I didn't get anywhere. </p>
",87090,14-08-2019 13:07,Why does this solution guarantee that the prince knocks on the right door to find the princess?,"<p>I found this puzzle <a href=""http://www.folj.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=12849"" rel=""noreferrer"">online</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the top floor of a castle lives a princess. The floor has 17 bedrooms arranged in a row. Each bedroom has doors connecting to the adjoining bedrooms as well as to the outside corridor. The princess sleeps in a different bedroom each night by opening the door to an adjoining bedroom and spending the night and the next day in that room.</p>
<p>One day a prince arrives at the castle and is desirous of marrying the princess. The guardian angel at the castle tells him of the princess' sleeping patterns and informs him that each morning he may knock on one of the outside doors. If the princess happens to be behind that door, she will open it and consent to marry him. The prince also has a return ticket to his kingdom in 30 days, so he can make at most 30 attempts. Can the prince win the hand of the princess, and if so, what is his strategy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An unstated assumption here is that the princess can move to <em>any</em> adjacent room (she's not restricted to moving in one direction). So a possible sequence could be 3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2...</p>
<p>Further down the thread at the link, this solution is given:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Prince should knock on the second door from one of the ends of the corridor (call it door #2), and knock on the next adjacent door each successive day until he reaches the second door from the opposite end of the corridor (door #16). The day after that, he should begin the same process in reverse order (meaning he will knock on the 16th door two days in a row). By the time he reaches his starting point (door #2 on the 30th day), he will have found the princess.</p>
<p>Number the doors 1 thru 17.<br />
If the princess occupies an even numbered room on the day the prince first knocks on a door (#2), then she will either occupy the same room he knocks on or she will be an even number of rooms away. Since both move to an adjacent room each day, this will hold true so she will never be in a room adjacent to the one he knocks on, and thus never be in a position to move past him the next day. She will have nowhere else to go by the time he reaches the 16th door, and will have by then been located. If she, on the other hand, was in an odd numbered room when he began, then she will be in an even numbered room when the prince starts the process again on day 16 (when he knocks on door #16 the second time).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been trying to follow the solution, but I don't quite get it. The main assumption the logic in the solution seems to hinge on is this: <strong>&quot;she will never be in a room adjacent to the one he knocks on, and thus never be in a position to move past him the next day.&quot;</strong> I can't figure out what evidence from the puzzle supports that assumption. If we begin knocking at door #2 and the princess is in room #3, our next move (following this solution) will be to knock on door #3. But at this point the princess could have moved to room #2, and we will keep moving to higher numbered rooms, and the princess could easily remain in the lower-numbered rooms.</p>
<p>So I'm having trouble understanding why this is the solution. Can someone explain it more clearly/in a different manner? Why will this process ensure the princess is found?</p>

  <p> I believe the answer is C. For each column, move from top to bottom on each side (left/right) of the rectangle. If there are two occurrences of the black dot, it is cancelled out, so there's a blank in the bottom rectangle. If there's only one black dot, it is added to the bottom rectangle. So the right column is basically the same as the middle column apart from left/right being switched, hence the resulting image is the same.</p>

How to flip top row center pieces on a 4x4x4 Rubik's cube?,"<p>I'm trying to solve a 4x4x4 Rubik's cube by first reducing it to 3x3x3 and I'm stuck in the end. I've completed all sides, matched all corners, but two pieces remain and I can't figure out how to flip them without disturbing anything else. By the way even if I break it down to the point where it resembles a 3x3x3 and start solving it again, the same scenario repeats itself again in the end, but with a different color.</p>

",90120,13-10-2019 10:57,Rubik's cube 4x4 parity moves,"<p><sup>Note: since asking this question I've purchased several other twisty puzzles and now regret taking the ""look up algorithms online"" approach to solving - in the end I get much more enjoyment from the puzzles where I worked out to solve them myself than the ones where I didn't. If you're stuck at this point I would recommend seeking resources to understand the <em>concept</em> of parity and then try to come up with a solution yourself. You won't end up with a super efficient algorithm, but you will understand it, which is ultimately more satisfying. Or it is for me at least. That said, answers to this question are still welcome.</sup></p>

<p>I'm solving my 4x4 Rubik's cube (aka Rubik's revenge) for the first time, and I have the ""OLL parity"" case:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HQzpv.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HQzpv.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>There are plenty of algorithms for this available online, but different people use different notation and nobody ever says which one they're using, so I risk messing up my cube if I guess wrongly.</p>

<p>So, please give me algorithms for solving the OLL parity, <em>using the following notation</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>R</code>: turn just the rightmost face clockwise</li>
<li><code>Rw</code> (R wide): turn the rightmost half of the cube clockwise, i.e. the rightmost face and the slice adjacent to it</li>
<li><code>r</code>: turn the rightmost slice clockwise, but not the rightmost face</li>
<li><code>R2</code>, <code>Rw2</code>, <code>r2</code>: as above but turning it twice</li>
<li><code>R'</code>, <code>Rw'</code>, <code>r'</code>: as above but turning it anticlockwise</li>
<li><code>L</code>, <code>F</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>U</code>, <code>D</code>: left, front, back, up, down. (All clockwise by default, can be modified as above)</li>
<li><code>x</code>: if you use this, <strong>please explain what it means</strong>, as I have no clue.</li>
<li><code>-</code> (hyphen): if you use this, <strong>please explain what it means</strong>, as I have no clue.</li>
<li><code>(</code>, <code>)</code> (parentheses): if you use these, <strong>please explain what they mean</strong>, as I have no clue.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you use <em>anything else at all</em> in your notation, please explain what it means. If you prefer a different notation from the above that's fine, but please explain it.</p>

<p>I'm holding my cube with the unsolved cubies facing me at the top. (i.e. the red face would be the front in the diagram above.) If I should start in some other orientation, please say so.</p>

<p><strong>It would be helpful to have an algorithm that leaves all other pieces alone, as my cube is in exactly the almost-solved state above.</strong> But if algorithms that don't do this are significantly shorter and/or easier to remember then that would be fine too.

Four coins on the corner of a rotating rectangular table,"<p>The game has two players (A) The leader (B) player (you)</p>

<p>Four coins are placed on the corners of a <strong>rectangular</strong> rotating table. Some of the coins are facing head and some tail. Your goal is to arrange the coins so that all heads are up or all tails are up. </p>

<p>Here are the rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>You can ask the leader to flip any at most two coins but you can't see any coin ever.</li>
<li>You can feel the table's orientation.</li>
<li>Once you are done, the table will be rotated by the leader by either 90 or 180 or 270 or 360 degrees in clockwise direction.</li>
<li>If all coins are either head or tail then a bell will ring.</li>
</ol>

<p>Devise a strategy so that you will win the game.</p>

<p>NOTE: You shouldn't play the game randomly.</p>

<p>This puzzle is somewhat similar to puzzle  <a href=""https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/20817/four-cups-on-a-table?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1]"">Four cups on a table</a></p>
",60969,23-02-2018 18:17,Sliding Bolt Puzzle,"<p>You are in a room with two adjacent doors locked by four sliding bolts. The bolts are movable and block only one door at a time; however, you do not know which bolt currently is blocking which door.</p>

<p>An example configuration:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Di9bU.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Di9bU.png"" alt=""two doors blocked by four sliding bolts (example configuration)""></a></p>

<p>Luckily, there are three buttons <kbd>A</kbd>, <kbd>B</kbd>, <kbd>C</kbd>, which cause some bolts to slide from the door they are curently blocking over to the other door. However, each button can trigger different actions, which one is used is determined at each push in a fully random way:</p>

<ul>
<li>Button <kbd>A</kbd> slides <em>at random</em> either

<ul>
<li>bolt 1 <em>or</em></li>
<li>bolt 2 <em>or</em></li>
<li>bolt 3 <em>or</em></li>
<li>bolt 4.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Button <kbd>B</kbd> slides at random either

<ul>
<li>bolt 1 and 2 <em>or</em></li>
<li>bolt 2 and 3 <em>or</em></li>
<li>bolt 3 and 4 <em>or</em></li>
<li>bolt 4 and 1.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Button <kbd>C</kbd> slides at random either

<ul>
<li>bolt 1 and 3 <em>or</em></li>
<li>bolt 2 and 4.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Your task is to find a sequence of button activations to get out of the room (i.e., to move all the bolts to one door so the other one is open) regardless of the unknown initial position of the bolts. (You may try the doors after each touch of a button to see whether they are open.) The sequence should be as short as possible.</p>

Engineers logic test for a job,"<p>Two engineers go to a job interview. They are introduced and told they are looking for people with team working skills.

Engineer B can see 4 turbines.  </p>

<p>They are told that in the park there are 24 or 26 turbines, none of them are seen by both engineers at the same time, and between the two they can see all the turbines in the park.<br>
During the next hours, an interviewer will ask them a question per round, always being the same question. He will ask first to engineer A, and, if he does not answer, will then ask to engineer B. The question is: ""Are there 24, or 26 turbines in the park?"".  </p>

<p>If one of the engineers answer correctly, both are hired.<br>

<p>EDIT: Oras found this puzzle asked 2 years ago (with a different story) <a href=""https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/45664/are-there-eighteen-or-twenty-bars-in-my-castle"">here</a>, however since the numbers differ and it's rather old I will keep the post. By the way, this is my first post here, glad to be part of the community!</p>
",73462,04-10-2018 10:21,Are there eighteen or twenty bars in my castle?,"<p>Two friends, Mark and Rose, are very famous logicians; they are so clever that they can deduce any logic connection possible in a matter of minutes even from the most vague situation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, one day, the two friends are abducted by the Evil Logician, who is envious of their fame, and believes they don't deserve it. He imprisons them in his castle and decides to test their cleverness. They are kept in two different cells, which are located on opposite sides of the castle, so that they cannot communicate in any way. Mark's cell's window has <em>twelve</em> steel bars, while Rose's cell's window has <em>eight</em>.</p>

<p>The first day of their imprisonment, the Evil Logician tells first Mark and then Rose that he has decided to give them a riddle to solve. The rules are simple, and solving the riddle is the only hope the two friends have for their salvation:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the castle there are no bars on any window, door or passage, except for the windows in the two logicians' cells, which are the only barred ones (this implies that each cell has at least one bar on its window).</li>
<li>The Evil Logician will ask the same question to Mark every morning: ""<em>are there eighteen or twenty bars in my castle?</em>""

<ul>
<li>If Mark doesn't answer, the same question will then be asked to Rose the night of the same day.</li>
<li>If either of them answers correctly, and is able to explain the logical reasoning behind their answer, the Evil Logician will immediately free both of them and never bother them again.</li>
<li>If either of them answers wrong, the Evil Logician will throw away the keys of the cells and hold Mark and Rose prisoners for the rest of their lives.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Both Mark and Rose know these rules.</li>

The sheep and the lions: is the conventional answer right?,"<p>I am challenging the solution to <a href=""http://www.braingle.com/brainteasers/teaser.php?op=2&amp;id=9026&amp;comm=0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this classic puzzle</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is an island filled with grass and trees and plants. The only inhabitants are 100 lions and 1 sheep.
The lions are special:</p>
<ol>
<li>They are infinitely logical, smart, and completely aware of their surroundings.</li>
<li>They can survive by just eating grass (and there is an infinite amount of grass on the island).</li>
<li>They prefer of course to eat sheep.</li>
<li>Their only food options are grass or sheep.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, here's the kicker:</p>
<ol start=""5"">
<li>If a lion eats a sheep he TURNS into a sheep (and could then be eaten by other lions).</li>
<li>A lion would rather eat grass all his life than be eaten by another lion (after he turned into a sheep).</li>
</ol>
<p>Assumptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assume that one lion is closest to the sheep and will get to it before all others. Assume that there is never an issue with who gets to the sheep first. The issue is whether the first lion will get eaten by other lions afterwards or not.</li>
<li>The sheep cannot get away from the lion if the lion decides to eat it.</li>
<li>Do not assume anything that hasn't been stated above.</li>
</ol>
<p>So now the question:
Will that one sheep get eaten or not and why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Read the link if you are unfamiliar with it.</p>
<p>The bottom line of the solution is that an even number of lions won't eat the sheep, and an odd number will. I fully understand the recursive reasoning behind this.</p>
<p>But suppose there were an even number of lions, and one of the lions decided to eat the sheep anyway. This would violate one of the conditions of the riddle -- that they all act rationally.</p>
<p>But, if this were to actually happen, all the other lions would have to abandon their belief that all the others are rational. Then, they could no longer trust their previous logic. Clearly, none of the remaining 99 lions would eat that sheep -- since that would leave an even number of lions, and a sheep just got eaten by an even number of lions!</p>
<p>Then, no lion would eat the lion who behaved irrationally and ate the sheep. Was he, then, truly acting irrationally?</p>
",49646,02-03-2017 01:40,Hungry lions and a goat,"<p>There are 53 lions in a cage and 1 goat. All the lions are very hungry and would want to eat the goat. But the problem here is that any lion who eats the goat can satisfy his hunger but he will himself become a goat and then other lions will eat him. All lions are intelligent and understand this fact, so obviously no one wants to die becoming a prey for others.</p>

<p>So, the question here is will the goat be eaten or not?</p>

What is this puzzle and what is this solving strategy?,"<p>This puzzle is a mini game in an app I recently downloaded. In the game it is referred to as a Mobius Puzzle(after some searching I found referenced as a TwoBik Puzzle). But I cant find any other names for it or how to solve it.</p>
<p>How it is Played:
The goal is to order the number left to right then top to bottom. You can slide each row or column in either direction moving every tile 1 space in that direction: the tile tht is pushed off the board loops to the other side of the same row or column.</p>

",99652,03-07-2020 17:56,Techniques for solving row & column sliding puzzles,"<p>This is a type of puzzle that at first looks like a tile-sliding puzzle, where you have a grid of tiles with 1 missing tile, and you can slide individual tiles into the blank spot, eventually arranging them in the right order.</p>

<p>But it's quite different -- there is no blank spot, and you slide an entire row or column of tiles at a time, where the title that overflows wraps around to the other side. It seems to have more in common with a Rubik's Cube than a sliding puzzle.</p>

<p>Here's an example:
<a href=""https://www.proprofs.com/games/row-slide-puzzle/"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.proprofs.com/games/row-slide-puzzle/</a></p>

<p>There is also an Apple Arcade game <em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qisFRUVTzl4"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Enchanted World</a></em> (trailer) with these types of puzzles -- only they aren't in perfect square shapes, each row can have a different number of tiles, and there is sometimes move count limitations, or a mobile bad guy that makes titles unmovable. What makes its puzzles more challenging is that half the puzzle is figuring out what the correct arrangement even is -- as if getting into that arrangement wasn't a challenge enough :)</p>

<p>I can't seem to find any information about solutions to these types of puzzles. All the information I find is about tile sliding puzzles, and Rubik's Cube type puzzles are more complex. This is like a 2D rubik's cube.</p>

<p>Is there a name for this type of puzzle? What movement techniques are useful for solving them?</p>

<p>For example, one technique I've identified lets you fix the order of titles in a particular row. Say the row is '1324' and you need it to be '1234'. This is really 2 separate steps -- the 2 and 3 are each in the wrong position, and you can fix each one separately. For the 2, slide its column up or down, separating it from the row. Then slide the row such that the position the 2 should be in is adjacent to the 2, then slide 2's column the opposite way as you originally did, and now 2 is in the correct position (and if necessary you may now slide the row back to how it originally was relative to the rest of the puzzle). Repeat for 3. The issue with this technique is that it does not leave the rest of the board as it was. You invariably end up trading one misplaced tile for another, just moving the problem around. Insights or academic links to similar puzzles would be helpful!</p>

Each player has the same 5 cards, showing A, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (Ace being low). Each player then has to choose a single card from their hand.</p>

<p>The objective of the game is to choose the <strong>lowest unique card</strong> that is displayed in the round. If two or more people show the same numbered card, they will not win. If no one chooses a card unique from anyone else, then the round is repeated until someone has a uniquely numbered card.</p>

<p>Each of them has 55 seconds to decide which card they want to draw, at which point they must each in turn show what they have picked. No one else knows which card anyone else has picked until they are displayed at the end of the time limit, but they are allowed to communicate with each other during that period.</p>

<p>The competent logician has to come up with a logical solution for which card to choose to maximize his chance of winning. What card should he choose? If the round needs to be repeated, should he choose the same card again?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Whilst I do have a specific ""correct"" answer in mind, it is not necessarily the one that I will choose, as any card could reasonably be chosen and win, or lose. I'll accept the answer that is accompanied by the best logical argument for the choice of card.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: To clarify, he has never played this game with any of his friends before, so he has no idea how they will initially think to play the game. He is unable to make any assumptions about their possible strategies, he is on the same playing field as they are, he simply needs his own strategy that he believes will give him an edge.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I should also clarify that this is only for the first game that they play. Only one game (with potentially multiple rounds) needs to be played until there is a winner. Once the game begins to be repeated the strategies will evolve based on what each person sees that the others are choosing. This question is for the first game only.</p>

Prisoners and their hats,"<p>This is a variant some of the existing questions on this exchange, but I can't see this exact problem.</p>
<p><strong>Basic example</strong> <a href=""https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/282/hats-and-aliens"">duplicates this question</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Some prisoners are going to be lined up, all facing forward.</li>
<li>A hat, either black or white, will be placed on their head.</li>
<li>The prisoners at the back of the line can see all of the hats in front of them, but they can't see their own, or behind them.</li>
<li>The prisoners at the front of the line can hear the people at the back of the line.</li>
<li>The prisoners can strategise before hand.</li>
<li>The prisoners have a perfect memory.</li>
<li>This is a logic puzzle, they don't use an vocal variance or intonation to communicate, they only say 'black' or 'white'.</li>
<li>Starting at the back of the line, the prisoner guesses the color of their hat, and if they are correct, they are free to go.</li>
</ul>
<p>The strategy for this is fairly straight forward, and all of the prisoners except the last one are guaranteed to go free.</p>
<p>Basically, the prisoner at the end of the line counts the number of white hats, and if this number is odd he says 'white' and if it is even he says 'black'.</p>
<p>The person in front of him can now deduce, by counting the number of white hats in front of him if he has a white or black hat, and the person in front of him, by keeping track of what the previous people have said can similarly deduce what color hat they have.</p>
<p><strong>Now with mulitple colors!</strong></p>
<p>Now let's extend the problem, and deal with more than two colors of hat. If we are ok with three prisoners dying, how many different color hats can we strategise a solution for?</p>
<p>I don't know the answer, but as far as I have reasoned, it is at least 10.</p>

The Green-Eyed Dragons Riddle,"<p>You visit a remote desert island inhabited by one hundred very friendly dragons, all of whom have green eyes. They haven't seen a human for many centuries and are very excited about your visit. They show you around their island and tell you all about their dragon way of life (dragons can talk, of course).</p>

<p>They seem to be quite normal, as far as dragons go, but then you find out something rather odd. They have a rule on the island which states that if a dragon ever finds out that he/she has green eyes, then at precisely midnight on the day of this discovery, he/she must relinquish all dragon powers and transform into a long-tailed sparrow. However, there are no mirrors on the island, and they never talk about eye color, so the dragons have been living in blissful ignorance throughout the ages.</p>

<p>Upon your departure, all the dragons get together to see you off, and in a tearful farewell you thank them for being such hospitable dragons. Then you decide to tell them something that they all already know (for each can see the colors of the eyes of the other dragons). You tell them all that at least one of them has green eyes. Then you leave, not thinking of the consequences (if any). Assuming that the dragons are (of course) infallibly logical, what happens?</p>

",38933,03-08-2016 06:38,In the 100 blue eyes problem - why is the oracle necessary?,"<h2>The riddle</h2>

<p>Randall Munroe (of <a href=""https://xkcd.com"">xkcd</a> fame) has, a bit hidden on his site, <a href=""https://xkcd.com/blue_eyes.html"">a logic puzzle</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A group of people with assorted eye colors live on an island. They are
  all perfect logicians -- if a conclusion can be logically deduced,
  they will do it instantly. No one knows the color of their eyes. Every
  night at midnight, a ferry stops at the island. Any islanders who have
  figured out the color of their own eyes then leave the island, and the
  rest stay. Everyone can see everyone else at all times and keeps a
  count of the number of people they see with each eye color (excluding
  themselves), but they cannot otherwise communicate. Everyone on the
  island knows all the rules in this paragraph.</p>
  
  <p>On this island there are 100 blue-eyed people, 100 brown-eyed people,
  and the Guru (she happens to have green eyes). So any given blue-eyed
  person can see 100 people with brown eyes and 99 people with blue eyes
  (and one with green), but that does not tell him his own eye color; as
  far as he knows the totals could be 101 brown and 99 blue. Or 100
  brown, 99 blue, and he could have red eyes.</p>
  
  <p>The Guru is allowed to speak once (let's say at noon), on one day in
  all their endless years on the island. Standing before the islanders,
  she says the following:</p>
  
  <p>""I can see someone who has blue eyes.""</p>
  
  <p>Who leaves the island, and on what night?</p>
  
  <p>There are no mirrors or reflecting surfaces, nothing dumb. It is not a
  trick question, and the answer is logical. It doesn't depend on tricky
  wording or anyone lying or guessing, and it doesn't involve people
  doing something silly like creating a sign language or doing genetics.
  The Guru is not making eye contact with anyone in particular; she's
  simply saying ""I count at least one blue-eyed person on this island
  who isn't me.""</p>
  
  <p>And lastly, the answer is not ""no one leaves.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He admits the puzzle isn't his:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I didn't come up with the idea of this puzzle, but I've written and rewritten it over the the years to try to make a definitive version. The guy who told it to me originally was some dude on the street in Boston named Joel.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The answer</h2>

<p>He gives <a href=""https://xkcd.com/solution.html"">his solution</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The answer is that on the 100th day, all 100 blue-eyed people will leave. It's pretty convoluted logic and it took me a while to believe the solution, but here's a rough guide to how to get there. Note -- while the text of the puzzle is very carefully worded to be as clear and unambiguous as possible (thanks to countless discussions with confused readers), this solution is pretty thrown-together. It's correct, but the explanation/wording might not be the best. If you're really confused by something, let me know.</p>
  
  <p>If you consider the case of just one blue-eyed person on the island, you can show that he obviously leaves the first night, because he knows he's the only one the Guru could be talking about. He looks around and sees no one else, and knows he should leave. So: [THEOREM 1] If there is one blue-eyed person, he leaves the first night.</p>
  
  <p>If there are two blue-eyed people, they will each look at the other. They will each realize that ""if I don't have blue eyes [HYPOTHESIS 1], then that guy is the only blue-eyed person. And if he's the only person, by THEOREM 1 he will leave tonight."" They each wait and see, and when neither of them leave the first night, each realizes ""My HYPOTHESIS 1 was incorrect. I must have blue eyes."" And each leaves the second night.</p>
  
  <p>So: [THEOREM 2]: If there are two blue-eyed people on the island, they will each leave the 2nd night.</p>
  
  <p>If there are three blue-eyed people, each one will look at the other two and go through a process similar to the one above. Each considers the two possibilities -- ""I have blue eyes"" or ""I don't have blue eyes."" He will know that if he doesn't have blue eyes, there are only two blue-eyed people on the island -- the two he sees. So he can wait two nights, and if no one leaves, he knows he must have blue eyes -- THEOREM 2 says that if he didn't, the other guys would have left. When he sees that they didn't, he knows his eyes are blue. All three of them are doing this same process, so they all figure it out on day 3 and leave.</p>
  
  <p>This induction can continue all the way up to THEOREM 99, which each person on the island in the problem will of course know immediately. Then they'll each wait 99 days, see that the rest of the group hasn't gone anywhere, and on the 100th night, they all leave.</p>
  
  <p>Before you email me to argue or question: This solution is correct. My explanation may not be the clearest, and it's very difficult to wrap your head around (at least, it was for me), but the facts of it are accurate. I've talked the problem over with many logic/math professors, worked through it with students, and analyzed from a number of different angles. The answer is correct and proven, even if my explanations aren't as clear as they could be.</p>
  
  <p>User lolbifrons on reddit posted <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/khhpl/reddit_what_is_your_favorite_riddle/c2kdlr6"">an inductive proof</a>.</p>
  
  <p>If you're satisfied with this answer, here are a couple questions that may force you to further explore the structure of the puzzle: </p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>What is the quantified piece of information that the Guru provides that each person did not already have? </li>
  <li>Each person knows, from the beginning, that there are no less than 99 blue-eyed people on the island. How, then, is considering the 1 and 2-person cases relevant, if they can all rule them out immediately as possibilities? </li>
  <li>Why do they have to wait 99 nights if, on the first 98 or so of these nights, they're simply verifying something that they already know? </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>These are just to give you something to think about if you enjoyed the main solution. They have answers, but please don't email me asking for them. They're meant to prompt thought on the solution, and each can be answered by considering the solution from the right angle, in the right terms. There's a different way to think of the solution involving hypotheticals inside hypotheticals, and it is much more concrete, if a little harder to discuss. But in it lies the key to answering the four questions above.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2>The question</h2>

<p>Everybody on the island could have come to the conclusion that 'There is at least one person with blue eyes', simply by looking around, seeing 100 people with blue eyes, and realising that everybody can see at least one person with blue eyes.</p>

<p><strong>So why is it necessary for the Guru to say 'I see at least one person with blue eyes' to get the ball rolling?</strong></p>

  <p>Hi this is Paul, also known as ""Mr. Party Cog"". I'm inviting you to my
  place so you can join the party! The party started around a year ago and
  is fairly new and I plan to keep it going. I know you will be interested
  because reading this tells me that we share a common thing. But first
  you need to know the address.</p>
  
  <p>Here are the landmarks and a guide:</p>
  
  <p>I'm located at a commercial area. Look for Stock Trade street and
  expect 3 stops going there.</p>
  
  <p>Once you have reached the street, look for a light blue gate with a big ""P""
  on top of it. Don't get lost, a lot of parties are also held on this
  street. Just to be sure, your name will be posted above the gate
  unless you are not on the list. </p>
  
  <p>Once inside, you may ask your questions on anyone there for directions
  because my place is big. Don't worry, a lot of people are also asking
  and many are willing to answer.</p>
  
  <p>When you get to the house, my butler will give you the key to your own
  room. That room is just made for you for being on the list. The best
  part is, you can personalize it! Arrange it based on your personality
  or even put a picture of yourself!</p>
  
  <p>During the party, you can socialize and ask other people and you may
  gain popularity! Just make sure to have sense or else they will put
  you down. </p>
  
  <p>Did you get the address? I know that after you read my invitation, you
  will find the right party. Hope to see you here!</p>

Blue eyes riddle: what information is gleaned after the first night?,"<p>There are good explanations on this site and xkcd of the inductive reasoning leading to the <a href=""https://xkcd.com/blue_eyes.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">riddle’s</a> <a href=""https://xkcd.com/solution.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">solution</a>, but nowhere have I found an answer to the following aspect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exactly what information is learnt — and by whom — after the first night?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My question is triggered by the following train of thought:</p>
<ul>
<li>everybody knows that everybody sees at least 98 blue pairs of eyes</li>
<li>with this knowledge, everybody concludes that nobody will leave during the first night</li>
<li>since everybody knows that everybody will <em>derive</em> this, it seems to me that “nobody leaves” is common knowledge</li>
<li>if it indeed is common knowledge, then no new information is learnt, so the second day is exactly like the first</li>
<li>in this case, nobody would ever leave, because the system is static</li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming that Randall Munroe’s solution is correct, my statement on common knowledge must be incorrect. However, I am unable to prove that.</p>
<p>I think the crucial point here is that all hypotheses that involve less than 98 pairs of blue eyes are irrelevant because every observer knows that no observer can observe a lower number. This intuition collides with the tower of nested hypotheses constructed in the inductive proof. So which way is right, and which way will lead to the immediate collapse of this universe?</p>
<p>EDIT: IMPORTANT NOTE</p>
<p>Please refrain from answering with cases that involve less than 4 blue-eyed people: consider that my reasoning above requires that everybody knows that everybody sees at least two pairs of blue eyes. There are no induction steps within my question nor should they be needed to answer my question.</p>
<p>EDIT2: Thanks to @TimC’s answer I was able to come up with a more precise way of asking my question, the core of it is <a href=""https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/100313/blue-eyes-riddle-why-do-all-nested-hypotheses-need-to-be-considered"">“why do all nested hypotheses need to be considered?”</a>.</p>
",100217,22-07-2020 18:22,In the 100 blue eyes problem - why is the oracle necessary?,"<h2>The riddle</h2>

<p>Randall Munroe (of <a href=""https://xkcd.com"">xkcd</a> fame) has, a bit hidden on his site, <a href=""https://xkcd.com/blue_eyes.html"">a logic puzzle</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A group of people with assorted eye colors live on an island. They are
  all perfect logicians -- if a conclusion can be logically deduced,
  they will do it instantly. No one knows the color of their eyes. Every
  night at midnight, a ferry stops at the island. Any islanders who have
  figured out the color of their own eyes then leave the island, and the
  rest stay. Everyone can see everyone else at all times and keeps a
  count of the number of people they see with each eye color (excluding
  themselves), but they cannot otherwise communicate. Everyone on the
  island knows all the rules in this paragraph.</p>
  
  <p>On this island there are 100 blue-eyed people, 100 brown-eyed people,
  and the Guru (she happens to have green eyes). So any given blue-eyed
  person can see 100 people with brown eyes and 99 people with blue eyes
  (and one with green), but that does not tell him his own eye color; as
  far as he knows the totals could be 101 brown and 99 blue. Or 100
  brown, 99 blue, and he could have red eyes.</p>
  
  <p>The Guru is allowed to speak once (let's say at noon), on one day in
  all their endless years on the island. Standing before the islanders,
  she says the following:</p>
  
  <p>""I can see someone who has blue eyes.""</p>
  
  <p>Who leaves the island, and on what night?</p>
  
  <p>There are no mirrors or reflecting surfaces, nothing dumb. It is not a
  trick question, and the answer is logical. It doesn't depend on tricky
  wording or anyone lying or guessing, and it doesn't involve people
  doing something silly like creating a sign language or doing genetics.
  The Guru is not making eye contact with anyone in particular; she's
  simply saying ""I count at least one blue-eyed person on this island
  who isn't me.""</p>
  
  <p>And lastly, the answer is not ""no one leaves.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He admits the puzzle isn't his:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I didn't come up with the idea of this puzzle, but I've written and rewritten it over the the years to try to make a definitive version. The guy who told it to me originally was some dude on the street in Boston named Joel.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The answer</h2>

<p>He gives <a href=""https://xkcd.com/solution.html"">his solution</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The answer is that on the 100th day, all 100 blue-eyed people will leave. It's pretty convoluted logic and it took me a while to believe the solution, but here's a rough guide to how to get there. Note -- while the text of the puzzle is very carefully worded to be as clear and unambiguous as possible (thanks to countless discussions with confused readers), this solution is pretty thrown-together. It's correct, but the explanation/wording might not be the best. If you're really confused by something, let me know.</p>
  
  <p>If you consider the case of just one blue-eyed person on the island, you can show that he obviously leaves the first night, because he knows he's the only one the Guru could be talking about. He looks around and sees no one else, and knows he should leave. So: [THEOREM 1] If there is one blue-eyed person, he leaves the first night.</p>
  
  <p>If there are two blue-eyed people, they will each look at the other. They will each realize that ""if I don't have blue eyes [HYPOTHESIS 1], then that guy is the only blue-eyed person. And if he's the only person, by THEOREM 1 he will leave tonight."" They each wait and see, and when neither of them leave the first night, each realizes ""My HYPOTHESIS 1 was incorrect. I must have blue eyes."" And each leaves the second night.</p>
  
  <p>So: [THEOREM 2]: If there are two blue-eyed people on the island, they will each leave the 2nd night.</p>
  
  <p>If there are three blue-eyed people, each one will look at the other two and go through a process similar to the one above. Each considers the two possibilities -- ""I have blue eyes"" or ""I don't have blue eyes."" He will know that if he doesn't have blue eyes, there are only two blue-eyed people on the island -- the two he sees. So he can wait two nights, and if no one leaves, he knows he must have blue eyes -- THEOREM 2 says that if he didn't, the other guys would have left. When he sees that they didn't, he knows his eyes are blue. All three of them are doing this same process, so they all figure it out on day 3 and leave.</p>
  
  <p>This induction can continue all the way up to THEOREM 99, which each person on the island in the problem will of course know immediately. Then they'll each wait 99 days, see that the rest of the group hasn't gone anywhere, and on the 100th night, they all leave.</p>
  
  <p>Before you email me to argue or question: This solution is correct. My explanation may not be the clearest, and it's very difficult to wrap your head around (at least, it was for me), but the facts of it are accurate. I've talked the problem over with many logic/math professors, worked through it with students, and analyzed from a number of different angles. The answer is correct and proven, even if my explanations aren't as clear as they could be.</p>
  
  <p>User lolbifrons on reddit posted <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/khhpl/reddit_what_is_your_favorite_riddle/c2kdlr6"">an inductive proof</a>.</p>
  
  <p>If you're satisfied with this answer, here are a couple questions that may force you to further explore the structure of the puzzle: </p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>What is the quantified piece of information that the Guru provides that each person did not already have? </li>
  <li>Each person knows, from the beginning, that there are no less than 99 blue-eyed people on the island. How, then, is considering the 1 and 2-person cases relevant, if they can all rule them out immediately as possibilities? </li>
  <li>Why do they have to wait 99 nights if, on the first 98 or so of these nights, they're simply verifying something that they already know? </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>These are just to give you something to think about if you enjoyed the main solution. They have answers, but please don't email me asking for them. They're meant to prompt thought on the solution, and each can be answered by considering the solution from the right angle, in the right terms. There's a different way to think of the solution involving hypotheticals inside hypotheticals, and it is much more concrete, if a little harder to discuss. But in it lies the key to answering the four questions above.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2>The question</h2>

<p>Everybody on the island could have come to the conclusion that 'There is at least one person with blue eyes', simply by looking around, seeing 100 people with blue eyes, and realising that everybody can see at least one person with blue eyes.</p>

<p><strong>So why is it necessary for the Guru to say 'I see at least one person with blue eyes' to get the ball rolling?</strong></p>

Ali Hamza also gave him <span class=""math-container"">$30$</span> melons, but these one were a little bit more costly: he will have to sell them at the price of <span class=""math-container"">$1$</span> dirham for two melons.

What is my number in circle?,"<p>N > 1 people sit in a circle clearly seeing all others. They are going to be blindfolded and, while in this state, hats are put on their heads - one per person, naturally. On each hat there is written a number from 0 to N-1. The numbers may be different or some may be equal. Nothing is known about that, except that each is picked up from the set {0, 1, 2, ..., N-1}. When blindfolds are removed the numbers are in full display: everyone sees all the numbers except one's own. Each is tasked with guessing his number. They are not allowed to communicate in anyway. Each is given a piece of paper on which to write his guess. The papers are collected and the responses are examined. The team wins if there is at least one right guess.</p>

<p>This is the puzzle. But there is one more stipulation: before blindfolds were put on, the proceedings of the experiment were explained to the participants. At this point they were to allowed to discuss the matter and devise a protocol, i.e., the manner in which they would be going to make their guesses. Subsequently, no communication would be possible?</p>

A minimal stalemate with no possible illegal moves,"<p>Imagine that the main goal of the game of chess were to actually capture the opponent's king, not just checkmating him. So a stalemate would (usually) no longer be a draw, but a loss for the stalemated side (since they are compelled to expose their king into check, and he will be captured next move). However, some exceptional positions exist (let's call such a position an <em>absolute stalemate</em>), where the stalemated side still has no moves even if it were allowed to move the king into check / stay in check.</p>

<p>Here is an example of an absolute stalemate with 8 pieces on the board (Black to move):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ajWgs.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ajWgs.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>(in text: W: Kh8, Nc1; B: Ka1, Rb2, Bb1, Pa2, b3, c2).</p>

<p>So, here Black has <em>absolutely</em> no moves: Black's king is surrounded by his own pieces which are not pinned;  all black pawns are blocked by the pieces and cannot capture anything, and the rook and the bishop are also blocked. The white knight cannot be captured and does not give check to the black king.</p>

<p><strong>The question:</strong> What is the minimum number of pieces to achieve an absolute stalemate?</p>
",84183,21-05-2019 10:09,"No moves at all, not even to put yourself in check","<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qx58O.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qx58O.png"" alt=""stalemate max""></a></p>

<p>Here, white is stalemated. The king is not in check, but white has no legal moves. Not because any move white makes would put the king in check -- which is how stalemates normally happen -- <em>but because no white piece can move at all, even if we temporarily ignore the no-self-check rule</em>.</p>

<p>(Black is not stalemated: king takes bishop.)</p>

<p>Now, this example is a bit wasteful, 62 white pieces plus the two kings. Also, it can't be reached from the starting position.</p>

<p>Come up with an example, using the fewest pieces (total both sides). Can it actually be reached from the starting position?</p>

<p>Two persons stand outside the room, They can decide on a tactic <strong>before</strong>
the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>One person enters the room, he can see the order, he can make one switch between places of two numbers. (e.g: (3,1,2) ---switch 3 and 1---> (1,3,2)).</li>
<li>After the switch (Or not switching) the person flips the cards and exits the room. (Other than the switch, the person does not change the order)</li>
<li>The second person enters the room, A number between [1,100] is called out of the void, he has 50 guesses to get that number.</li>

<li>The cards are identical, There are no particular features for specific cards or something like that.</li>

"Ten users, ten deadly collars and three lights","<p>One day, 10 puzzling.SE users, including you, find yourselves in a horrible prison. Each of you has a deadly collar, presently lethal. It is safe to take off only when <em>all</em> of the 10 collars have been unlocked, or you will <em>all</em> be dead.</p>

<p>A supervisor shows up and tells you about a game that you have to follow to unlock and take off your collars. (As for escaping, that's not important for now.)</p>

<p>For now, you may communicate freely and devise a plan. After the game begins, however, you will each work in isolation.</p>

<p>There is a room with a collar unlocking device and 3 lights with switches. In a random fashion, each of you will be taken into the room. When inside, your collar will unlock, you will be able to see the state of the 3 lights, and you will be able to turn on/off the lights at will.</p>

<p>At some point, one might know that everyone's collar has unlocked, and can take their own off.</p>

<p>Can you devise a plan where <em>everyone</em> can get their collar off surely and safely?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Details:</strong></p>

<p>You <em>do not</em> know the state of lights at the beginning.</p>

<p>The 3 lights are your only means of communication, and it's not possible to see them from outside. This basically means only one will be able to receive and send information at a time.</p>

<p>As for unlocking and taking off, you can think it as that you can take off the collar when you're sure everyone has entered the room at least once.</p>

<p>Each person <em>will</em> be taken inside multiple times. You will keep getting taken inside, but the game is considered 'done' when everyone's collar is off.</p>

<p>It is impossible to know, between two entries, whether anyone else has entered, or how many has entered.</p>

<p>'Random' means picking one uniformly randomly each time. However, a plan that fails sometimes, even with arbitrary low probability, is not acceptable. Your goal is to get everyone's collar off in finite entries <em>with probability 1</em>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Example solution with 2 users and 1 light:</strong></p>

<p>Let's define 'wait until' as 'do nothing in each entry until'.</p>

<ul>
<li>User 1: On first entry, get the light off no matter what. Then, wait until seeing the light on. It must be because User 2 turned it on, and it means User 2 has unlocked, so after seeing, turn the light off, and take off collar.</li>
<li>User 2: Wait until seeing the light off. Then turn it on. Wait until seeing the light off again. It must be User 1 that turned the light off, so take off collar.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>Extra credit:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Can you do it with only 2 lights?</li>
<li>Can you do it with arbitrarily many users <em>and</em> only 2 lights?</li>
<li>What if you get bored? Can you set up a 'chatroom' with the 3 lights? (A 'hardware bus protocol' that allows sending arbitrarily but finitely long messages in finite time with probability 1.)</li>
<li>What about a 2-light chatroom?</li>
<li>I did not come up with this. Do you happen to know the source of the problem? It would be great if someone could tell.</li>

<p>James awoke to find himself yet again imprisoned by an evil genius. At least, that's what he presumed. He was alone in a room with a strange device: it consisted of a person-sized glass chamber, with a single tube feeding out of it, splitting into 23 tubes which headed God knows where.</p>

<p><em>I do hope you're comfortable, since you will be here for quite a while. We're going to play a little game.</em> </p>

<p><em>Nothing so routine, Mister Bond. What I want is to test your mettle. The device in front of you is a cloning machine: it will completely vaporize your body, but will create 23 identical copies in your place, each to be housed in separate prison cells.</em> </p>

<p><em>After this I will, at random times, bring a random clone out of his cell into the Light Bulb Room. This room has <strong>two</strong> lightbulbs, one red and one blue, which are each either on or off. The clone may then toggle none, either or both of the bulbs, before I return him to his cell. I will take care to ensure the clones can't communicate with each other, or change the Light Bulb Room in any other way then toggling these bulbs.</em></p>

<p>""And what exactly am I supposed to accomplish through all this?""</p>

<p><em>A clone may at any time make the declaration that <strong>every</strong> clone has visited the Light Bulb Room room. If he is right, you win and may all go free. If he is wrong, you will all be executed.</em></p>

<p><em>I'll give you some time to think of a plan before this begins. Since my machine copies your brain state exactly, all of the clones will follow the exact same plan.</em></p>

<p><em>Time to see if you really are the stuff of legends, Mister Bond.</em> </p>

<p>Compare and contrast this with the classic ""100 prisoners and one lightbulb"" puzzle. In that one, the prisoners could use an asymmetric strategy where one prisoner was singled to count the others. This asymmetry is now ruled out since all prisoners are clones.

I made one dollar from thin air!,"<p>Two friends went to a store to buy a gift worth 50 dollars. The owner of the shop was not present so they bought the gift from his assistant and left. When the owner returned to the shop he told his assistant that the price of the item was not 50 dollars but 45 dollars. He asked his assistant to return 5 dollars to them. But the assistant kept 3 dollars to himself and gave the two friends 2 dollars. The friends divided the money among themselves. Thus they paid 24 dollars each.

Marking the safe cup,"<p>My friend just told me this riddle and I cannot for the life of me figure out the answer. But he assures me there is one.</p>

<p>There's a room with 64 cups, one of them is water and the rest are poisoned. In front of each cup is a light when you go into the room, you will know which cup is safe, and you will be able to turn one light on or off to let your friend know which cup to drink. However the lights will be randomly on and off, and you won't know the configuration until you're in the room. </p>

<p>You know the organization of the cups (for example we can just say it's a straight line of them), but you aren't allowed to move the cups, or mark them in any way. And my friend assures me it's not 'leave the light on until the cup is warmer'. Basically, it's a light pattern, not some sneaky unexpected answer.</p>

<p>Obviously you need to establish a code with your friend, but how do you establish a way to tell him which cup in a line of 64 while only being able to change one light?</p>

",53318,11-07-2017 23:58,The coolest checkerboard magic trick,"<p>In the small town of Terni (Italy), there's a couple of young friends named Marco and Leonardo, who like to perform magic tricks to a restricted audience of common friends and relatives. They like to call themselves <em>""The prodigious Duo""</em>. Every week-end, The prodigious Duo meets at the house of the leader, which happens to be Marco, to practice new magic tricks, learn new techniques, and, most importantly, to set up the magic show of the week, which will be shown to the audience in the late evening.</p>

<p>Recently, the leader of The prodigious Duo discovered what he claims to be ""the coolest magic trick ever done using a chessboard"" <sup>(which actually is a checkerboard, but that's basically the same thing)</sup>. 
Marco only tested the trick on a $2 \times 2$ squares checkerboard, nonetheless he's certain that the trick would work on any checkerboard with size $n \times n$, where $n$ is a perfect power of two (meaning that the binary logarithm $\log_{2}n$ of $n$ is an integer). 
So <strong>he managed to create a working strategy for a real checkerboard (with $n=8$)</strong>. Once tested the strategy for the bigger board on a piece of paper, Marco is now ready to explain the trick to Leonardo.</p>

<h3>He starts explaining the <em>peculiarities of the checkerboard</em> involved in the trick, since that it isn't a normal checkerboard:</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hXa3A.png"" alt=""Example of the checkerboard""></p>

<ul>
<li><p>""The checkerboard is composed by $8 \times 8$ squares, like a normal one, except that the squares are all red colored, and distinguishable because of the vertical and horizontal lines which define them. This red color choice is only made to avoid confusion when moving the pieces.""</p></li>
<li><p>""The pieces of the checkerboard are normal coin-shaped pieces, except that they're <strong>white on one side and black on the other one</strong>.""</p></li>
<li><p>""The checkerboard is <strong>always visible to all the members of the audience</strong> during the show, and so will be me and you, remember it, this is important.""</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Then he explains <em>the magical trick</em> from the spectators' point of view:</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>""At the beginning of the show, the checkerboard is filled with sixty-four pieces, each one placed inside a different square. <em>The pieces' sides facing up are of mixed color, and their initial color doesn't really matter</em> for the purpose of the trick (e.g. the quantity of black or white pieces doesn't matter).""</p></li>
<li><p>""Once the checkerboard is set up, <em>you will ask for a member of the audience</em> (we'll call him $P$) <em>to come up on the stage to participate in the trick</em>.""</p></li>
<li><p>""Once on the stage, I will cover my eyes and ears with a special mask which will make me unable to see or hear anything around me. Now you'll <strong><em>ask $P$ to rearrange the colors</em></strong> that he sees on the checkerboard flipping any number of pieces he wants, any number of times.""</p></li>
<li><p>""Now you will take a minute or less to <strong><em>look closely and meticulously at the checkerboard's configuration</em></strong>, and then <strong><em>ask $P$ to: choose a piece among the 64 pieces on the board, flip it only one time, and memorize its position</em></strong>.""</p></li>
<li><p>""Once $P$ has done its simple task, you'll do the same thing: you'll carefully <strong><em>choose a piece</strong> (which doesn't necessarily need to be different from the one chosen by $P$), <strong>and flip it one time</em></strong>. At this point, you will lock your head into the same kind of mask I used before, and, once done, ask $P$ to touch me to let me know you cannot see or hear anything.""</p></li>
<li><p>""Felt the touch and removed my mask, <strong><em>I'll reach the checkerboard, carefully observe it for a bit, and finally remove a single piece from it: the piece that has been chosen by $P$.</em></strong>""</p></li>
<li><p>""I'll now help you to remove your mask and bow down with you to the surprisingly cheering audience and the astonished $P$, which is trying to work out what sort of sorcery has been going on moments before.""</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Leonardo takes a minute to elaborate all the information provided to him by Marco, and then, excited, replies: ""This is an incredible magic trick, but man, I mean, sixty-four pieces... how could we ever even think about that? Tell me you've got a solving strategy which is as beautiful as this impressive trick!"". <strong>Marco starts now to explain <em>the real strategy</em> which they are going to apply to recognize the piece chosen by the volunteer on the stage...</strong></p>

<h3>You're asked to discover and explain the strategy which The prodigious Duo is going to apply to find the correct piece chosen by the volunteer.</h3>

<hr>

<h2>Clarifications and notes</h2>

<p>Now, stating some basic facts that might be misunderstood:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>During their show, none of the members of The prodigious Duo can communicate with each other, because of the masks they use to cover their heads.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This means that Marco cannot, in any way, see or listen to what's happening on the stage when the volunteer is mixing up the colors flipping the pieces on the checkerboard.</p></li>
<li><p>And also that Leonardo cannot, in any way, see or listen to what's going on when Marco removes his mask and looks at the checkerboard, revealing the piece chosen by the volunteer.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>No one knows, except for the two magicians, the strategy applied to recognize the piece moved by the volunteer.</p></li>
<li><p>The volunteer called on the stage isn't, in any way, collaborating with the magicians nor cheating; same goes for the rest of the audience.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid stupid answers like ""Marco checks for the fingerprint leaved by the volunteer on the chosen piece"" or similar.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I want to clarify that I didn't think up this puzzle by myself, I only made up some little story-line; I did listen to it years ago talking with some friends of mine, and it randomly came back in my mind recently. For this reason, <strong>I do not know the exact solution of this puzzle</strong> (and this is the main reason why I am asking for a solution here on SE), nonetheless I'm still able to provide additional details and explanations to anyone who asks for them, editing the question itself or answering the comments. <strong>Given that I do not know the real source of this puzzle, it would also be nice if someone could provide it</strong>.

Is it necessary to state that there is a logician with a blue hat in this 100 logicians puzzle?,"<p>I've been discussing the logic puzzle where 100 logicians, all wearing blue hats, are trapped in a room and told:  they can leave when a bell rings if they know they know they are wearing a blue hat, they are all perfect logicians and at least one of them is wearing a blue hat. The bell rings every five minutes.</p>

<p>I solved this by reasoning that if one person is in the room they can leave immediately as they know they are wearing a blue hat. If there are two people in the room then they will each reason that if they are wearing a red hat the other person would leave immediately and if the other person doesn't they can leave after the second bell ring. For three people they each reason that if they are wearing a red hat then the previous situation for two people would play out and if that doesn't happen they can leave after the third bell ring and so on until with 100 people they all leave after the 100th bell ring.</p>

<p>My solution to the problem relies on the fact that they are told one of them is wearing a blue hat but I've been told it should be enough that they all know that everyone can see a blue hat and therefore they don't need to be told at the start that at least one person is wearing a blue hat. Is it still solvable without that information?</p>

",90409,18-10-2019 22:00,In the 100 blue eyes problem - why is the oracle necessary?,"<h2>The riddle</h2>

<p>Randall Munroe (of <a href=""https://xkcd.com"">xkcd</a> fame) has, a bit hidden on his site, <a href=""https://xkcd.com/blue_eyes.html"">a logic puzzle</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A group of people with assorted eye colors live on an island. They are
  all perfect logicians -- if a conclusion can be logically deduced,
  they will do it instantly. No one knows the color of their eyes. Every
  night at midnight, a ferry stops at the island. Any islanders who have
  figured out the color of their own eyes then leave the island, and the
  rest stay. Everyone can see everyone else at all times and keeps a
  count of the number of people they see with each eye color (excluding
  themselves), but they cannot otherwise communicate. Everyone on the
  island knows all the rules in this paragraph.</p>
  
  <p>On this island there are 100 blue-eyed people, 100 brown-eyed people,
  and the Guru (she happens to have green eyes). So any given blue-eyed
  person can see 100 people with brown eyes and 99 people with blue eyes
  (and one with green), but that does not tell him his own eye color; as
  far as he knows the totals could be 101 brown and 99 blue. Or 100
  brown, 99 blue, and he could have red eyes.</p>
  
  <p>The Guru is allowed to speak once (let's say at noon), on one day in
  all their endless years on the island. Standing before the islanders,
  she says the following:</p>
  
  <p>""I can see someone who has blue eyes.""</p>
  
  <p>Who leaves the island, and on what night?</p>
  
  <p>There are no mirrors or reflecting surfaces, nothing dumb. It is not a
  trick question, and the answer is logical. It doesn't depend on tricky
  wording or anyone lying or guessing, and it doesn't involve people
  doing something silly like creating a sign language or doing genetics.
  The Guru is not making eye contact with anyone in particular; she's
  simply saying ""I count at least one blue-eyed person on this island
  who isn't me.""</p>
  
  <p>And lastly, the answer is not ""no one leaves.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He admits the puzzle isn't his:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I didn't come up with the idea of this puzzle, but I've written and rewritten it over the the years to try to make a definitive version. The guy who told it to me originally was some dude on the street in Boston named Joel.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The answer</h2>

<p>He gives <a href=""https://xkcd.com/solution.html"">his solution</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The answer is that on the 100th day, all 100 blue-eyed people will leave. It's pretty convoluted logic and it took me a while to believe the solution, but here's a rough guide to how to get there. Note -- while the text of the puzzle is very carefully worded to be as clear and unambiguous as possible (thanks to countless discussions with confused readers), this solution is pretty thrown-together. It's correct, but the explanation/wording might not be the best. If you're really confused by something, let me know.</p>
  
  <p>If you consider the case of just one blue-eyed person on the island, you can show that he obviously leaves the first night, because he knows he's the only one the Guru could be talking about. He looks around and sees no one else, and knows he should leave. So: [THEOREM 1] If there is one blue-eyed person, he leaves the first night.</p>
  
  <p>If there are two blue-eyed people, they will each look at the other. They will each realize that ""if I don't have blue eyes [HYPOTHESIS 1], then that guy is the only blue-eyed person. And if he's the only person, by THEOREM 1 he will leave tonight."" They each wait and see, and when neither of them leave the first night, each realizes ""My HYPOTHESIS 1 was incorrect. I must have blue eyes."" And each leaves the second night.</p>
  
  <p>So: [THEOREM 2]: If there are two blue-eyed people on the island, they will each leave the 2nd night.</p>
  
  <p>If there are three blue-eyed people, each one will look at the other two and go through a process similar to the one above. Each considers the two possibilities -- ""I have blue eyes"" or ""I don't have blue eyes."" He will know that if he doesn't have blue eyes, there are only two blue-eyed people on the island -- the two he sees. So he can wait two nights, and if no one leaves, he knows he must have blue eyes -- THEOREM 2 says that if he didn't, the other guys would have left. When he sees that they didn't, he knows his eyes are blue. All three of them are doing this same process, so they all figure it out on day 3 and leave.</p>
  
  <p>This induction can continue all the way up to THEOREM 99, which each person on the island in the problem will of course know immediately. Then they'll each wait 99 days, see that the rest of the group hasn't gone anywhere, and on the 100th night, they all leave.</p>
  
  <p>Before you email me to argue or question: This solution is correct. My explanation may not be the clearest, and it's very difficult to wrap your head around (at least, it was for me), but the facts of it are accurate. I've talked the problem over with many logic/math professors, worked through it with students, and analyzed from a number of different angles. The answer is correct and proven, even if my explanations aren't as clear as they could be.</p>
  
  <p>User lolbifrons on reddit posted <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/khhpl/reddit_what_is_your_favorite_riddle/c2kdlr6"">an inductive proof</a>.</p>
  
  <p>If you're satisfied with this answer, here are a couple questions that may force you to further explore the structure of the puzzle: </p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>What is the quantified piece of information that the Guru provides that each person did not already have? </li>
  <li>Each person knows, from the beginning, that there are no less than 99 blue-eyed people on the island. How, then, is considering the 1 and 2-person cases relevant, if they can all rule them out immediately as possibilities? </li>
  <li>Why do they have to wait 99 nights if, on the first 98 or so of these nights, they're simply verifying something that they already know? </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>These are just to give you something to think about if you enjoyed the main solution. They have answers, but please don't email me asking for them. They're meant to prompt thought on the solution, and each can be answered by considering the solution from the right angle, in the right terms. There's a different way to think of the solution involving hypotheticals inside hypotheticals, and it is much more concrete, if a little harder to discuss. But in it lies the key to answering the four questions above.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2>The question</h2>

<p>Everybody on the island could have come to the conclusion that 'There is at least one person with blue eyes', simply by looking around, seeing 100 people with blue eyes, and realising that everybody can see at least one person with blue eyes.</p>

<p><strong>So why is it necessary for the Guru to say 'I see at least one person with blue eyes' to get the ball rolling?</strong></p>

Don't Fail MY Exam,"<p>A professor decides the following grading scheme in his class. After the final exam is graded, he keeps all the papers upside down on his table in a random order so that no student can recognise his own paper. Each student during his turn can overturn at most n/2 of these papers (where n is the total number of students in the class) and guess whether he received an A or a B on the final (there are only two grades given). Obviously the student doesn't know which paper is his, so it is not guaranteed that he will find his own score by looking at n/2 scores. The papers are then turned back and kept in the original order. The students cannot pass any information to others. All the students pass the course if <em>everyone</em> guesses their grade correctly, and they fail otherwise. Come up with a strategy that the students can decide on beforehand, so that the probability that they all will pass is more than a positive constant independent of n. </p>

A spy in Fruitland,"<p>The army of the big and violent-prone country of Fruitland is planning to launch a nuclear rocket that could possibly destroy the near pacific little country of Vegetablesland.
It is well known that there are exactly sixteen rocket stations in Fruitland, but no one in Vegetablesland knows which one is going to launch the rocket.</p>

<p>The intelligence services of Vegetablesland will send their best agent miss 00F to investigate the case. In their codename that space station is called STX.
She is a very skilled secret agent - she will figure out in very few time which station is STX - but she is also well known by the counterintelligence of Fruitland: she will be followed anytime, her phone will be tapped and she won't have any chance to communicate back what she discovered.</p>

<p>An employee of the intelligence of Vegetablesland receives every month a long basket of fruit from their friends in Fruitland. They thought that maybe miss 00F can use this basket to communicate with the agents in their native country.
There are fifteen fruits in a row with a very precise order in the prepackaged basket, each fruit can be either an apple or a pear.</p>

<p>Once miss 00F has discovered STX she will have very little time to:</p>

<ul>
<li>have a quick look to the basket; and</li>
<li>replace at most one fruit in the basket.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means she can remove an apple from the basket and put a pear in the same position, or take a pear and replace it with an apple, or do nothing. 
She cannot change the order of the fruits, she cannot remove a fruit without replacing it nor replace more than one fruit otherwise she will arouse suspicion and the Fruitland police will catch her.</p>

<p>Before she leaves, the Vegetablesland intelligence and agent 00F came up with a strategy that she will use abroad to communicate back which station is STX. What is this strategy?</p>

<p>Clarifications:</p>

<ul>
<li>the fruit basket is prepackaged and no one knows what it's inside it in advance: it can contain any fruit sequence.</li>
<li>the fruit inside the basket is sorted. The basket is actually a long-shaped container with a tip on a side. Both agent 00F and their intelligence knows that the first fruit is the one at the beginning of the basket and the last one is the one near the tip.</li>
<li>the order of the fruits will not be scrambled during the delivery. Of course the fruit that 00F replaced will arrive in Vegetablesland instead of the original one. </li>
<li>in Vegetablesland they can't tell which fruit was touched by agent 00F.</li>

",91906,11-12-2019 18:44,The coolest checkerboard magic trick,"<p>In the small town of Terni (Italy), there's a couple of young friends named Marco and Leonardo, who like to perform magic tricks to a restricted audience of common friends and relatives. They like to call themselves <em>""The prodigious Duo""</em>. Every week-end, The prodigious Duo meets at the house of the leader, which happens to be Marco, to practice new magic tricks, learn new techniques, and, most importantly, to set up the magic show of the week, which will be shown to the audience in the late evening.</p>

<p>Recently, the leader of The prodigious Duo discovered what he claims to be ""the coolest magic trick ever done using a chessboard"" <sup>(which actually is a checkerboard, but that's basically the same thing)</sup>. 
Marco only tested the trick on a $2 \times 2$ squares checkerboard, nonetheless he's certain that the trick would work on any checkerboard with size $n \times n$, where $n$ is a perfect power of two (meaning that the binary logarithm $\log_{2}n$ of $n$ is an integer). 
So <strong>he managed to create a working strategy for a real checkerboard (with $n=8$)</strong>. Once tested the strategy for the bigger board on a piece of paper, Marco is now ready to explain the trick to Leonardo.</p>

<h3>He starts explaining the <em>peculiarities of the checkerboard</em> involved in the trick, since that it isn't a normal checkerboard:</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hXa3A.png"" alt=""Example of the checkerboard""></p>

<ul>
<li><p>""The checkerboard is composed by $8 \times 8$ squares, like a normal one, except that the squares are all red colored, and distinguishable because of the vertical and horizontal lines which define them. This red color choice is only made to avoid confusion when moving the pieces.""</p></li>
<li><p>""The pieces of the checkerboard are normal coin-shaped pieces, except that they're <strong>white on one side and black on the other one</strong>.""</p></li>
<li><p>""The checkerboard is <strong>always visible to all the members of the audience</strong> during the show, and so will be me and you, remember it, this is important.""</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Then he explains <em>the magical trick</em> from the spectators' point of view:</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>""At the beginning of the show, the checkerboard is filled with sixty-four pieces, each one placed inside a different square. <em>The pieces' sides facing up are of mixed color, and their initial color doesn't really matter</em> for the purpose of the trick (e.g. the quantity of black or white pieces doesn't matter).""</p></li>
<li><p>""Once the checkerboard is set up, <em>you will ask for a member of the audience</em> (we'll call him $P$) <em>to come up on the stage to participate in the trick</em>.""</p></li>
<li><p>""Once on the stage, I will cover my eyes and ears with a special mask which will make me unable to see or hear anything around me. Now you'll <strong><em>ask $P$ to rearrange the colors</em></strong> that he sees on the checkerboard flipping any number of pieces he wants, any number of times.""</p></li>
<li><p>""Now you will take a minute or less to <strong><em>look closely and meticulously at the checkerboard's configuration</em></strong>, and then <strong><em>ask $P$ to: choose a piece among the 64 pieces on the board, flip it only one time, and memorize its position</em></strong>.""</p></li>
<li><p>""Once $P$ has done its simple task, you'll do the same thing: you'll carefully <strong><em>choose a piece</strong> (which doesn't necessarily need to be different from the one chosen by $P$), <strong>and flip it one time</em></strong>. At this point, you will lock your head into the same kind of mask I used before, and, once done, ask $P$ to touch me to let me know you cannot see or hear anything.""</p></li>
<li><p>""Felt the touch and removed my mask, <strong><em>I'll reach the checkerboard, carefully observe it for a bit, and finally remove a single piece from it: the piece that has been chosen by $P$.</em></strong>""</p></li>
<li><p>""I'll now help you to remove your mask and bow down with you to the surprisingly cheering audience and the astonished $P$, which is trying to work out what sort of sorcery has been going on moments before.""</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Leonardo takes a minute to elaborate all the information provided to him by Marco, and then, excited, replies: ""This is an incredible magic trick, but man, I mean, sixty-four pieces... how could we ever even think about that? Tell me you've got a solving strategy which is as beautiful as this impressive trick!"". <strong>Marco starts now to explain <em>the real strategy</em> which they are going to apply to recognize the piece chosen by the volunteer on the stage...</strong></p>

<h3>You're asked to discover and explain the strategy which The prodigious Duo is going to apply to find the correct piece chosen by the volunteer.</h3>

<hr>

<h2>Clarifications and notes</h2>

<p>Now, stating some basic facts that might be misunderstood:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>During their show, none of the members of The prodigious Duo can communicate with each other, because of the masks they use to cover their heads.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This means that Marco cannot, in any way, see or listen to what's happening on the stage when the volunteer is mixing up the colors flipping the pieces on the checkerboard.</p></li>
<li><p>And also that Leonardo cannot, in any way, see or listen to what's going on when Marco removes his mask and looks at the checkerboard, revealing the piece chosen by the volunteer.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>No one knows, except for the two magicians, the strategy applied to recognize the piece moved by the volunteer.</p></li>
<li><p>The volunteer called on the stage isn't, in any way, collaborating with the magicians nor cheating; same goes for the rest of the audience.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid stupid answers like ""Marco checks for the fingerprint leaved by the volunteer on the chosen piece"" or similar.</p></li>
</ul>

Oh, and in case you were wondering: yes, that ""Marco"" is me, ahah.</p>

An old man walks by and asks them, “After looking at both of your friends foreheads, raise your hand if one or both of them have mud on their foreheads.“ All three children look at both their friends and raise their hands.</p>
<p>He then asks, “For a dollar, without touching your own forehead or looking in a mirror or anything similar, tell me if you have mud on your own forehead, and how you know that.” All three children are bewildered. Finally, one raises his hand and says, “i have mud on my forehead.” He explains how he knew this and receives the dollar.</p>

<p>and you gave me 1,2,3,4 and 5, I'd say that third-ranked is 5 and fourth-ranked is 1. In the same way I'd give the third and fourth ranked out of any five given numbers.</p>

<p>How would one find the highest ranked out of all these numbers?(If it is possible at all) And in how many steps (one step is giving me one tuple of five numbers)?
I'd also appreciate if one could suggest better tags for this.</p>

<p><em>EDIT:- also find the last (lowest) ranked out of all these numbers if possible</em></p>

Then they'd close every even-numbered locker, and then open or close every third locker, then every fourth locker, and so on up to 100, &quot;toggling&quot; each locker in the sequence, opening if it was closed, closing if it was open.</p>
<p>Once the jocks had toggled the last locker for the last time, a certain sequence of locker doors would be open. It was the nerds' job to figure out in a more elegant way which locker doors would still be open, before the jocks finished going through their &quot;brute force&quot; routine.</p>
<p>If the nerds cracked it, they were excused from PE class for the rest of the year. If they couldn't, they'd face the jocks in the traditional first-day dodgeball game. In the P.E. teacher's 30 year career, not a single nerd ever avoided his fate.</p>

<p>A man is lying dead in a field. Next to him there is an unopened package. There is no other creature in the field. How did he die?  </p>

<p>My notes to try and avoid this being too broad:  </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> The man died where he lies. He was not moved to this spot. (He wasn't shot, stabbed, poisoned, etc.) 
 Nothing happened earlier in the day to cause this death to be expected.<br>
 He did not die of natural causes, old age, etc.<br>
 He was not killed by lightning, or anything weather related.<br>
 He was not killed by an act of God (lightning, earthquake, forest fire, etc.)<br>
 There are no other objects of note anywhere in the field, and no objects have been removed or added since his death.<br>
 There are no tire tracks or other signs of another human being around him.<br>
 The man was not killed by any creature (snake, spider, etc.) that then moved (walked, slithered, flew) away.<br>
 The man did not kill himself.<br>
 This happened in the typical world, with regular laws of physics, a depressing lack of magic, and (sadly) no aliens.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the first round of answers finding loopholes, a couple more notes. To those that this eliminates your answer, thank you for helping me find those loopholes:  </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> The man's death was instant (no time for anything to leave the field before he died)<br>
 The man was not doing anything illegal.<br>
 The contents of the package did not cause his death.<br>
 There was nothing growing or living in, or recently added to the field that caused his death. The field is not toxic.   </p>

The Football Murder Mystery,"<blockquote>
  <p>""THE COACH IS DEAD"". 
  That's the news buzzing around the country.
  There always was a sort of hatred towards the coach after he failed to guide the Team into the Olympics in football even after they were one of the stronger teams. Yet, this was unprecedented. The Circumstances of his death clearly show murder. He was stabbed in the back with a knife in the dressing room of the stadium. The knife was nowhere to be found. He had been murdered between 1600-1700 hours in the previous day. Only the players were present in that time near the dressing room. Thus, suspicions landed on them and it was determined that it had to be one of the 11 players of the team that had murdered him. Further investigations show that the coach knew that his life was in danger. A diary was found on his table. </p>
  
  <p>It read: FbyirgurPelcgnevguz</p>
  
  <p>He was a fan of ciphers. This was a good way not to arouse any suspicions in the mind of the murderer. </p>
  
  <p>Further on the next page it read:</p>

  <p>Now this confused everyone. No one could make head or tail of it.</p>

The mystery of the lost coin,"<blockquote>
  <p>Three travellers are on the road. As the day comes to an end, they pass through a village and agree they should stay here for the night. As luck would have it, the Brown Bear Inn is just down the road. They enter the building and ring a bell that is lying on the counter.</p>
  
  <p>The innkeeper emerges from a room behind the counter. ""Gentlemen!"" he says. ""What can I do for you?"". The travellers explain that they would like to have a room for the night. They ask if it is okay to share a single room with the three of them, as this will be less demanding of their tight budget. ""No problem! I'll give you our family room. It is 30 coins for one night"". The travellers pay 10 coins each and go up to their room to rest.</p>
  
  <p>A couple of minutes later, the innkeeper has a sudden realisation. It is not Sunday, as he thought, Monday has come already. This means that all rooms are a bit cheaper and that he has charged the travellers 5 coins too much. So he grabs five coins, goes up to their room, and knocks on their door. ""Excuse me"", he says, ""I just realised I charged you a bit too much for your stay, I somehow thought it was the weekend still. Your room is five coins cheaper on a Monday, so I've come to bring you your money back"".</p>
  
  <p>The travellers appreciate the innkeeper's honesty, but face a minor issue. How are they going to divide these five coins between the three of them? They discuss briefly and come to the following solution: each of the travellers will get 1 coin back. The last two coins will be a tip for the innkeeper as a reward for his honesty.

The travellers have now each paid 9 coins, or 27 coins in total, and the innkeeper has 2. They started with 30 coins, but the total is now 3*9 + 2 = 29. Where has the last coin gone?</p>

<p><strong>Not part of the riddle</strong>:
This is an old riddle that we had to get our heads around in primary school back in the Netherlands. I've occasionally used it as a 'party trick' and found that some peers also have a hard time solving it (university graduates, believe it or not). I feel like this might be one of those riddles that is easier if you see it written down, like here, in stead of just being told. But since I'm not sure if this riddle is well known outside the old country, I thought I'd share anyway. :-)</p>

Where should the Armor go?,"<p>At the end of World War III, the country of Puzzandia has lost many of their planes due to lack of armor. As Puzzandia's plane maker, it is your duty to put armor on the planes. Each plane has been divided into 4 sections; The engine, the fuel tanks, the wings, and the rest of the plane. The only problem is, Puzzandia has only provided you with enough armor to cover 1 section. You are given statistics from the planes that have came back:</p>

<pre><code>Section      Bullet Holes per square foot

Engine       1.12
Fuel Tanks   1.43

<p>During WWII, Allied airforces were having a difficult time getting their bombers to withstand German artillery. Their planes desperately needed some armour to increase the chances of them surviving bomb runs. Unfortunately armour is heavy, so it could only be applied in specific areas where it was absolutely needed.</p>

<p>A mathematician named Abraham Wald examined the surviving planes, making a note of where the artillery damage was most severe. The military felt these damaged areas were obviously the most vulnerable parts of the plane and therefore should should have the armour applied to them. Wald, however, recommended that armour be added to the areas that <em>hadn't</em> been damaged by the artillery fire.</p>

Maximum number of the same word in an English language sequence (punctuation allowed),"<p>An old  school boy riddle is how to to  have  5  x  ""and"" in sequence and yet  still make grammatical sense. The answer is that a man saw a sign advertising Dogs and Cats for sale. He commented that the  sign was badly laid out because there was too much space between Dogs and ""and"" and ""and"" and Cats.  = 5 x ""and""
QUESTION: Can you make grammatically correct sequence with more than  5 x the  same word (not necessarily ""and"") ? If so, what is the maximum number of times of that word in sequence? 
NOTE:  By ""sequence"" I do not mean a single sentence. The ""sequence"" can be any number of consecutive sentences (and/or phrases) which themselves may include  as many punctuation and quotation marks as  you like as long as the whole ""sequence"" is correct grammatically.</p>
",70726,27-08-2018 08:01,Make a sentence with the most different uses of the same word,"<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I recently stumbled across the following grammatically correct sentence:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sentence relies on the fact that the word buffalo could be multiple things, and that each of these is used as a different part of speech, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li>A city in New York (used as a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_adjunct"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">noun adjunct</a>).</li>
<li>The American Bison (used as a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">noun</a>).</li>
<li>A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">verb</a> meaning to intimidate of confuse.</li>
</ul>

<p>The sentence roughly translates to: ""Bison from Buffalo, which other bison from Buffalo intimidate, intimidate bison from Buffalo.""</p>

<p>There's also a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia article</a> for this sentence, which explains things more in depth than I do here. On a side note, it has my new favorite title for a Wikipedia article.</p>

<h2>Challenge</h2>

<p>With that background, the goal of this question is to <strong>create a sentence made up of the <em>most</em> different homonyms of the same word.</strong> This is <em>not</em> a challenge to find the longest sentence consisting of one word. The ""buffalo"" sentence above has eight words, but only uses three definitions. And, as Deusovi pointed out on <a href=""https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/33704/39637"">this</a> somewhat similar question, a sentence using just the word buffalo could be made arbitrarily large.  </p>

<p>I know this changes the scope of the original question, but hopefully previous answers can still be used to help form new answers.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>While the buffalo sentence is nice in that all words used in it are spelled the same way, I will allow a mix of singular and plural variations of the word. I would also like a link or formal definition for each different use of the word, to ensure that each use is in fact an actual, even if narrow, use.</p>

I have a good question for thinkers out there. Mr. Mike's Retirement Party,"<p>When Mr.Mike finally retires, he is going to have a party on a cruise ship with all
12,184 of his former students. Each of the students will be given a number as they
board the carrier.
All his former students will line up around the edge to cheerfully greet him.
Mr.Mike will shake hands with student number one, then push number two overboard;
shake hands with student number three and then push number four overboard; shake
hands with number five and push six overboard. This pattern continues as he repeatedly
goes around and around and around the whole ship, shaking then shoving, until finally
there is only one student left. Which of the 12,184 students will that be?</p>

<p>This problem is different from the table one. You have a fixed amount of 12, 184 students.</p>

<p>Anyway, can anyone provide the explanation for this problem? I tried finding the solutions since this is identical to the Josephus problem.</p>
",81485,07-04-2019 05:04,How do you solve the circular table problem?,"<p>One classic puzzle has many different forms, but the basic strategy is the same.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time there was a crazy king who had a very wise minister
with him. The king had a habit of playing a strange game on a circular table.</p>
<p>The game was played as follows: The king told his minister a different number everyday -
let's say he says 5. Then minister would then arrange five people and ask
them to sit in a circular table with five chairs. Starting from a specific person, the king would then kill every
second person on the table, until only one remained at the end, to which he would give 1,000 gold coins.</p>
<p>For example, if there were five people on the table, starting from
person 1, he would kill person 2, person 4, person 1, and person 5 (skipping over persons 2 and 4 since they are already dead),
leaving person 3 as the survivor and winner.</p>
<p>Now the wise minister was so clever as to calculate the winner
beforehand as soon as king said the number, and asked his man to sit
at particular seat so as to not be killed and also win some gold.</p>
<p>How did the minister decide the winner?</p>

The king and two poisons,"<p>There is a kingdom and in the kingdom when you drink a poison the only way to cure yourself is to drink a stronger poison to neutralize it. The King wants to make the strongest poison possible in order to make sure he can neutralize any other poison he may be given. To do this he enlists the two best chemists of the land: Tom and Bob.</p>

<p>The king is going to have them both create a poison as strong as they can then have them drink the other person's poison then their own. Whoever dies created the weaker poison. Tom knows that Bob is much better at making poisons and he is sure to make a stronger poison. Knowing this, Tom makes a plan that ensures he lives and Bob dies.</p>

<p>The day of the contest arrives and Bob realizes that Tom must have known he had no chance against his prowess as a poison maker. So Bob thinks quickly and creates a new plan that ensures that once again he will live and Tom will die.</p>

",66318,28-05-2018 09:18,Duel between the knight and the dragon,"<p>A dragon and a knight live on an island where the only sources of fresh water are a pond (containing ordinary water) and six wells, numbered 1 to 6. Each well's water is completely indistinguishable from the pond water, but contains a magical poison that has no immediate symptoms, yet suddenly kills the drinker about an hour after drinking.</p>

<p>To make things complicated still, each well contains a different variety of poison. If a drinker who has been poisoned by a well drinks the water from another well, the result depends on the relative numbers. If the second well has a higher number then both poisons will eliminate each other and the drinker will be cured. If the second well has the same number or a lower one, it is as though the drinker had only drunk from the first well. For example, if you drink from well 1 and then from well 4 you will not be poisoned, but if you drink from well 4 and then well 1 you will be poisoned as though you had drunk only from well 4.</p>

<p>As a result of these rules, water from well 6 can cure poison from any of the other wells, but, when drunk by someone who is not poisoned, is incurably lethal.
Furthermore, while wells 1-5 are a short walking distance from each other, well 6 is located at the top of an unclimbable mountain on the island that the knight cannot reach but the dragon can fly onto very quickly.</p>

<p>This sets the stage for the following puzzle: both knight and dragon understand these rules completely, know the numbering of each of the wells, and each want the other dead. Being evenly matched in combat, they arrange a special sort of duel. Each secretly fills a glass of water from one of the island's sources, then meets the other in a field, where they exchange glasses, and drink. They may seek water from any of the island's sources that they can personally reach before and after.</p>

<p>Is it possible for either the knight or the dragon to ensure it will survive this duel?</p>

<p>Note: drinking the same poison twice in a row (or 20 times in a row) has exactly the same effect as drinking the poison once.</p>

<p>You propose your friend to make the game more interesting by replacing the usual playing dice with three special dice you have designed.
Your dice have a number of dots between 1 and 6 on each face like regular dice, but some numbers are repeated on different faces and some numbers are missing, and no two dice are identical.
Apart from this twist, those are pretty normal playing dice, not unbalanced towards any side.

<p>Your friends accepts, thinking that, if at all, he's being offered an advantage.
If one of your dice were stronger than the other two, your friend could use that die at every turn because he can choose first, and that would make his winning chances better.

Flip one of the 64 coins on chess board,"<p>I know the answer of this puzzle. I want to know does this puzzle works perfectly for every n × n chess board? Is there a upper bound to n?
What is the upper bound for n, if m coins are allowed to flip?</p>

<p>Puzzle:</p>

<p>You and your friend are imprisoned. Your jailer offers a challenge. If you complete the challenge you are both free to go. The rules are</p>

<p>The jailer will take you into a private cell. In the cell will be a chessboard and a jar containing 64 coins.
The jailer will take the coins, one-by-one, and place a coin on each square on the board. He will place the coins randomly on the board. Some coins will be heads, and some tails (or maybe they will be all heads, or all tails; you have no idea. It's all at the jailers whim. He may elect to look and choose to make a pattern himself, he may toss them placing them the way they land, he might look at them as he places them, he might not …). If you attempt to interfere with the placing of the coins, it is instant death for you. If you attempt to coerce, suggest, or persuade the jailer in any way, instant death. All you can do it watch.
Once all the coins have been laid out, the jailer will point to one of the squares on the board and say: “This one!” He is indicating the magic square. This square is the key to your freedom.
The jailer will then allow you to turn over one coin on the board. Just one. A single coin, but it can be any coin, you have full choice. If the coin you select is a head, it will flip to a tail. If it is a tail it will flip to a head. This is the only change you are allowed to make to the jailers initial layout.
You will then be lead out of the room. If you attempt to leave other messages behind, or clues for your friend … yes, you guessed it, instant death!
The jailer will then bring your friend into the room.
Your friend will look at the board (no touching allowed), then examine the board of coins and decide which location he thinks is the magic square.
He gets one chance only (no feedback). Based on the configuration of the coins he will point to one square and say: “This one!”
If he guesses correctly, you are both pardoned, and instantly set free. If he guesses incorrectly, you are both executed.
The jailer explains all these rules, to both you and your friend, beforehand and then gives you time to confer with each other to devise a strategy for which coin to flip.</p>

",54079,07-08-2017 18:22,The coolest checkerboard magic trick,"<p>In the small town of Terni (Italy), there's a couple of young friends named Marco and Leonardo, who like to perform magic tricks to a restricted audience of common friends and relatives. They like to call themselves <em>""The prodigious Duo""</em>. Every week-end, The prodigious Duo meets at the house of the leader, which happens to be Marco, to practice new magic tricks, learn new techniques, and, most importantly, to set up the magic show of the week, which will be shown to the audience in the late evening.</p>

<p>Recently, the leader of The prodigious Duo discovered what he claims to be ""the coolest magic trick ever done using a chessboard"" <sup>(which actually is a checkerboard, but that's basically the same thing)</sup>. 
Marco only tested the trick on a $2 \times 2$ squares checkerboard, nonetheless he's certain that the trick would work on any checkerboard with size $n \times n$, where $n$ is a perfect power of two (meaning that the binary logarithm $\log_{2}n$ of $n$ is an integer). 
So <strong>he managed to create a working strategy for a real checkerboard (with $n=8$)</strong>. Once tested the strategy for the bigger board on a piece of paper, Marco is now ready to explain the trick to Leonardo.</p>

<h3>He starts explaining the <em>peculiarities of the checkerboard</em> involved in the trick, since that it isn't a normal checkerboard:</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hXa3A.png"" alt=""Example of the checkerboard""></p>

<ul>
<li><p>""The checkerboard is composed by $8 \times 8$ squares, like a normal one, except that the squares are all red colored, and distinguishable because of the vertical and horizontal lines which define them. This red color choice is only made to avoid confusion when moving the pieces.""</p></li>
<li><p>""The pieces of the checkerboard are normal coin-shaped pieces, except that they're <strong>white on one side and black on the other one</strong>.""</p></li>
<li><p>""The checkerboard is <strong>always visible to all the members of the audience</strong> during the show, and so will be me and you, remember it, this is important.""</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Then he explains <em>the magical trick</em> from the spectators' point of view:</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>""At the beginning of the show, the checkerboard is filled with sixty-four pieces, each one placed inside a different square. <em>The pieces' sides facing up are of mixed color, and their initial color doesn't really matter</em> for the purpose of the trick (e.g. the quantity of black or white pieces doesn't matter).""</p></li>
<li><p>""Once the checkerboard is set up, <em>you will ask for a member of the audience</em> (we'll call him $P$) <em>to come up on the stage to participate in the trick</em>.""</p></li>
<li><p>""Once on the stage, I will cover my eyes and ears with a special mask which will make me unable to see or hear anything around me. Now you'll <strong><em>ask $P$ to rearrange the colors</em></strong> that he sees on the checkerboard flipping any number of pieces he wants, any number of times.""</p></li>
<li><p>""Now you will take a minute or less to <strong><em>look closely and meticulously at the checkerboard's configuration</em></strong>, and then <strong><em>ask $P$ to: choose a piece among the 64 pieces on the board, flip it only one time, and memorize its position</em></strong>.""</p></li>
<li><p>""Once $P$ has done its simple task, you'll do the same thing: you'll carefully <strong><em>choose a piece</strong> (which doesn't necessarily need to be different from the one chosen by $P$), <strong>and flip it one time</em></strong>. At this point, you will lock your head into the same kind of mask I used before, and, once done, ask $P$ to touch me to let me know you cannot see or hear anything.""</p></li>
<li><p>""Felt the touch and removed my mask, <strong><em>I'll reach the checkerboard, carefully observe it for a bit, and finally remove a single piece from it: the piece that has been chosen by $P$.</em></strong>""</p></li>
<li><p>""I'll now help you to remove your mask and bow down with you to the surprisingly cheering audience and the astonished $P$, which is trying to work out what sort of sorcery has been going on moments before.""</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Leonardo takes a minute to elaborate all the information provided to him by Marco, and then, excited, replies: ""This is an incredible magic trick, but man, I mean, sixty-four pieces... how could we ever even think about that? Tell me you've got a solving strategy which is as beautiful as this impressive trick!"". <strong>Marco starts now to explain <em>the real strategy</em> which they are going to apply to recognize the piece chosen by the volunteer on the stage...</strong></p>

<h3>You're asked to discover and explain the strategy which The prodigious Duo is going to apply to find the correct piece chosen by the volunteer.</h3>

<hr>

<h2>Clarifications and notes</h2>

<p>Now, stating some basic facts that might be misunderstood:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>During their show, none of the members of The prodigious Duo can communicate with each other, because of the masks they use to cover their heads.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This means that Marco cannot, in any way, see or listen to what's happening on the stage when the volunteer is mixing up the colors flipping the pieces on the checkerboard.</p></li>
<li><p>And also that Leonardo cannot, in any way, see or listen to what's going on when Marco removes his mask and looks at the checkerboard, revealing the piece chosen by the volunteer.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>No one knows, except for the two magicians, the strategy applied to recognize the piece moved by the volunteer.</p></li>
<li><p>The volunteer called on the stage isn't, in any way, collaborating with the magicians nor cheating; same goes for the rest of the audience.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid stupid answers like ""Marco checks for the fingerprint leaved by the volunteer on the chosen piece"" or similar.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Personal notes</h3>

<p>I want to clarify that I didn't think up this puzzle by myself, I only made up some little story-line; I did listen to it years ago talking with some friends of mine, and it randomly came back in my mind recently. For this reason, <strong>I do not know the exact solution of this puzzle</strong> (and this is the main reason why I am asking for a solution here on SE), nonetheless I'm still able to provide additional details and explanations to anyone who asks for them, editing the question itself or answering the comments. <strong>Given that I do not know the real source of this puzzle, it would also be nice if someone could provide it</strong>. Oh, and in case you were wondering: yes, that ""Marco"" is me, ahah.</p>

Last Person Remaining Avoids Death,"<p>There are 1600 people sitting around a circular table. The first person (person 1) has a sword and kills the second person then hands it to the next alive person (in this case person 3). Person 3 stabs person 4 and gives the sword to person 5. This goes on until person 1599 kills person 1600. Then person 1 kills person 3 and so on. This is repeated until there is only a single person remaining.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time there was a crazy king who had a very wise minister
with him. The king had a habit of playing a strange game on a circular table.</p>
<p>The game was played as follows: The king told his minister a different number everyday -
let's say he says 5. Then minister would then arrange five people and ask
them to sit in a circular table with five chairs. Starting from a specific person, the king would then kill every
second person on the table, until only one remained at the end, to which he would give 1,000 gold coins.</p>
<p>For example, if there were five people on the table, starting from
person 1, he would kill person 2, person 4, person 1, and person 5 (skipping over persons 2 and 4 since they are already dead),
leaving person 3 as the survivor and winner.</p>
<p>Now the wise minister was so clever as to calculate the winner
beforehand as soon as king said the number, and asked his man to sit
at particular seat so as to not be killed and also win some gold.</p>

"playing ""Coins on a table"" against a distracted friend","<p><sup>This puzzle is a follow-up of <a href=""https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/2534/coins-on-a-table"">Coins on a table</a> (<strong>warning</strong>: the link contains the answer to the original question).</sup></p>

<p>You are playing a game against your friend Alice: </p>

<ul>
<li>first Alice places one coin on a rectangular table (she can choose where to put it).</li>
<li>Then it's your turn: you choose where to place the second coin on the table.</li>
<li>Then Alice places another coin.</li>
<li>Then you place another coin.</li>
<li>and so on, until there is no space left to place any other coins. The player who cannot place its coin loses.</li>
</ul>

<p>You have an unlimited supply of identical coins -although you can use them only for this game, I'm sorry. The coins cannot overlap nor lie outside the boundary of the table.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If Alice plays first, who has a strategy to win this game? (this was the original question)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Original part of the puzzle:</strong></p>

<p>It is well known that Alice is a bit distracted. Even if she has a strategy to win this game (i.e. even if she can choose whether to go first or second depending on the answer of the previous question) she always get her first move wrong. That means that she does not play the move that allows her to win: she plays another move of their choice.
Then she realizes her mistake and she plays correctly for the rest of the match.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this scenario can you always win this game?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words: do you always have a strategy after Alice's first move or does it depend on ""how wrong"" is Alice's first move? </p>
",94789,10-03-2020 19:43,Perfect strategy for the 2nd player in 'The coins on a table game',"<p>I've just seen <a href=""https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/33548/the-diamond-game"">this</a> and looked at the duplicate <a href=""https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/2534/coins-on-a-table"">post</a> it directs me to. I'm interested in a point raised in one of the comments in the answer, although it wasn't resolved in that question. It is already established that the perfect strategy for the first player is to place a coin in the exact middle before mirroring their opponent's every move. </p>

<p>However, if the first player has no idea of what they are doing, what is the perfect strategy for the player going second if there is one?</p>

<p>If the first player has no idea of what they are doing, does the second player still have a reasonable chance of winning by playing perfectly?</p>

<p>How badly does a player have to blunder until they would 'throw' the game away to a perfect player? I'm not so sure that only one poorly made move could necessarily achieve this.</p>

<p>Summary of the rules for the game:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a 2-player game. You have a large (elevated) rectangular surface, and each player takes turns placing identical (circular) coins on the surface. Stacking is not allowed, and coins already placed aren't allowed to be moved. The player who is not able to place a coin on the surface without it falling off on their turn loses the game.</p>

<p>What is the missing number in the following sequence?:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>0, 4, 10, 32, ?, 317 ... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hint # 1: </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>It has nothing to do with differences between given terms such as (4-0 = 4, 10-4 = 6...).  Try a different pattern.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hint # 2: </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>The 10 should be a clue. We use base 10 numbers so 10 is a special number and is a key part of the pattern.  There is a reason it is not 9 or 11 for example.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hint # 3: </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>Don't bother with + or -, those wont help.  That is, for the function part (see hint 7), F(0), F(4), F(10)... don't use + or -.  Take a close look at the pattern in the 5 numbers given, and think about a function of those numbers having some pattern too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hint # 4: </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>Look carefully at the number sequence.  Do you see any pattern of how they are increasing in value?  I can tell you they will continue to increase.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hint # 5: </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>The pattern doesn't involve any complex mathematical expression, rather, it is quite simple.  Run some function on each of the 5 numbers given, and analyze the output of that function, then look for a pattern.  F(0), F(4), F(10)... will all follow this pattern.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hint # 6: </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>The 5th term (after 32) is a 3 digit number in the range 100..316 inclusive so 100, 101, 102... 315, 316.  Take your pick, but if you randomly guess, you only have a 1 in 217 chance of getting it right.  Also the correct answer, (to get the checkmark), needs an explanation but ""I guessed"" wont ""cut"" it.  There is a ""simple"" solution (pattern) to this puzzle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hint # 7: </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>There is no conditional solution, meaning that there is no particular term in the sequence (such as the first one), that is treated differently than the rest.  For example, if you found a solution that works with all terms except the 1st one (at least one person submitted an answer like that but it may have been deleted), a solution that states 0 for the first term, and some other pattern for the rest, although technically a valid solution, is not what I am looking for.  My solution works for any and all terms in the sequence regardless of position (1st term, 75th term, 1000th term...).  However, the pattern has a relation between the function of neighboring terms.  For example, suppose we define a function called F.  F(0) has a relationship with F(4) and that relationship is preserved the same way between F(4) and F(10).  That is, the pattern is invariant between neighboring terms.  Lets us call this relationship R.  Thus we have R(0,4) = R(4,10) = R(10,32) = R(32, x) = R(x, 317)...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hint # 8: </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> The even # terms (2nd, 4th, 6th...), if scaled to 1 digit before the decimal point only, (4.0, 3.2, 3.17...) will become asympototic to a certain irrational number as the term positions get higher and higher (20th, 22nd, 24th...).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am looking for a particular answer with a particular pattern that applies to all 6 numbers (5 given plus missing one).  Please give your answer as a number with an explanation why you think that is the correct answer.  I guess this problem is not as simple as I thought.  Good luck.</p>

<p>Jane and John were discussing a business idea. John wanted to make a little set to keep track of the date. It was to include two cubes with a single digit on each face that could be rearranged to show any day of the month (1-31).</p>

<p>""Look,"" he said, ""there are 72 ways of arranging the cubes, so it must be possible to design it for just 31 days!""</p>

<p>""No,"" responded Jane, ""there's less than 72. Presumably each cube has 6 different faces, so at least 2 are going to be overlapping. That's going to reduce it to... mmm""</p>

<p>[Question 1: how many different ways are there to put down the cubes to read out a two digit number in the condition that Jane just described?]</p>

<p>""Well, that should still be plenty."" John replied.</p>

<p>""Hang on, there's another problem."" Said Jane. ""You have got 10 digits altogether. You will need 0, 1, and 2 on both cubes, since you need to make 11, 22, and 0n for all n between 1 and 9 inclusive. That means you need to pair 0 with at least 9 other numbers. So it's got to be on both. Amiright?""</p>

<p>""I guess so. The argument for 0 applies to 1 and 2 also. Either way, I agree. Both cubes are going to need 0, 1, and 2""</p>

<p>""That leaves 3 spaces on each cube for the other numbers, or a total of 6 spaces. But there are 7 numbers left: 3 to 9."" Jane continued.</p>

<p>""I see what you mean. Maybe I should use dodecahedrons. I prefer them anyway."" Said John thoughtfully.</p>

<p>""Wait!"" Said Jane. ""Here's one for sale on the internet. How do they do it?""</p>

Find the lowest floor from which Venus eggs break,"<p>Venus gave you two eggs because she wants to test their strength.</p>

<p>She lives in a 100 floor building and she wants to find the first floor above which the eggs break when thrown out of the window.</p>

<p>More formally, there exist exactly one so-called critical floor such that:
- if you climb up to the critical floor or to any floor above it and then you throw an egg out of the window: the egg will break.
- if you climb up to any floor below the critical floor and then you throw an egg out of the window: the egg will not break. In this case you can reach the ground floor, pick up the egg and use it again.</p>

<p>The critical floor is the same for the two eggs; the eggs do not get weaker as you throw them outside.</p>

<p>You have to develop a strategy that find the critical floor using the smallest number of throws in its worst-case scenario. </p>

<p>What does ""number of throws in the worst-case scenario"" means:
Your strategy will likely take a different number of throws depending on which is the critical floor, but it has to work for every possible situation.</p>

<p>Take for example this simple strategy: go to the first floor and throw an egg. If it does not break, go to the second floor and throw it outside again.</p>

<p>Repeating this procedure by climbing up a floor at a time allows you to find the critical floor when the first egg breaks.
This strategy uses only a throw if the critical floor is the first one, it takes two throws if the critical floor is the second one and so on.</p>

<p>The worst-case scenario for this strategy is when the critical floor is the last one. In this case you are able to solve the problem using 100 throws: every strategy has a worst-case scenario in which the number of throws used to find the critical floor is maximum.</p>

<p>Your goal is to find a strategy that uses a very small number of throws even in its worst-case scenario.</p>

Weigh eight balls and find the lighter one,"<p>There are similar puzzles but I think this one is different.</p>

<p>You are given eight metal balls. You know one weighs less than the rest.</p>

<p>You are given a balance scale. What is the smallest number of weighings it takes to find the lighter one?</p>

</blockquote>
",45998,23-11-2016 17:04,Derivative of the coin weight problem,"<p>Most people are familiar with the following problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A well-known example has nine (or fewer) items, say coins (or balls), that are identical in weight save for one, which in this example is lighter than the other —a counterfeit (an oddball). The difference is only perceptible by weighing them on scale—but only the coins themselves can be weighed. Is it possible to isolate the counterfeit coin with only two weighings?</p>
<p>To find a solution, we first consider the maximum number of items from which one can find the lighter one in just one weighing. The maximum number possible is three. To find the lighter one we can compare any two coins, leaving the third out. If the two coins tested weigh the same, then the lighter coin must be one of those not on the balance. Otherwise, it is the one indicated as lighter by the balance.</p>
<p>Now, imagine the nine coins in three stacks of three coins each. In one move we can find which of the three stacks is lighter (i.e. the one containing the lighter coin). It then takes only one more move to identify the light coin from within that lighter stack. So in two weighings we can find a single light coin from a set of 3 X 3 = 9.</p>
<p>By extension, it would take only three weighings to find the odd light coin among 27 coins, and four weighings to find it from 81 coins.</p>

Can a group of professors determine their average salary without learning any information about each other's?,"<blockquote>
  <p>A group of at least 5 jealous professors are locked in a room. There is nothing else in the room but pencils and one tiny scrap of paper per person. The professors want to determine their average (mean, not median) salary so that each one can gloat or grieve over their personal situation compared to their peers. However, they are secretive people and do not want to give away any personal salary information to anyone else. Can they determine the average salary in such a way that no professor can discover any fact about the salary of anyone but herself? For example, even facts such as ""3 people earn more than $\$$40,000"" or ""no one earns more than $\$$90,000"" are not allowed.</p>

It's the end of the first quarter of 2017.<br>
This means it's the end of the 2016 fiscal year (at least in my country it is).<br>
It's time to draw the line.<br>
So the CEO did his calculations and said we did a good job so we should get a bonus.<br>
Yippeee...<br>
But there is a catch.  Or two.<br>
The CEO values smart people more than hard working people.<br>
So here is his bonus scheme straight from the CEO's mouth.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You all know your own monthly salary but not those of your colleagues.<br>
  If you can guess how much it costs me to pay all of you in one month you get a bonus. Otherwise I'll just take you out for beers, but no bonus.<br>
  You cannot ask the financial department. And you cannot find out how much the other people make a month.  </p>

<p>Now what strategy should we apply in order to know the total sum of the salaries per month? 
I really want the bonus.<br>
All I can tell you is that we are at least 3 employees and you can ignore the tax calculations. </p>

Three coins for the fair king,"<p>Based on the question <a href=""https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/77750/eight-coins-for-the-fair-king"">Eight coins for the fair king</a>:</p>
<p>I saw a comment saying <em>&quot;There isn't a good solution known even with three coins in all cases&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>So the challenge here is to try to solve the same problem placed above, except with only 3 coins.</p>
<p>The rules are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>You must create 3 coins of different value, no more.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Any sum of money must be paid with only 3 coins. This sum should be paid without giving change.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You must set N such that no price is allowed to be greater than N.</p>
</li>

<p> Coins of <code>1</code>, <code>2</code> and <code>5</code>, which can get me to a maximum of N = <strong>12</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The highest number that follows the rules wins, and if there's proof that it's definitely the highest answer possible, it gets the tick.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> You may only use up to 3 coins to pay every amount, rather than 8.</p>

<li>A proper noun. </li>

",78945,28-01-2019 10:57,longest sentence using only one word and variants,"<p>This is an open ended puzzle of wordplay.  Here's an example of acceptable words: reed, read, read, red, etc.  They are linked by either different spellings of the same pronunciation (reed and read), or different pronunciations of the same spelling (read, read). Only words in the OED are acceptable.</p>

<p>The puzzle is to create a long sentence using only words from such a pool.  Not all words in the pool need to be used, and adjacent words do not need to be linked.  Which sentence is the longest? </p>

<p>Answers must start with the proposed sentence in bold, followed by explanations or commentary as desired.</p>

<p>Degenerate approaches are not acceptable.  For example, suppose some buffalo are named Buffalo, after the spicy chicken wings.  Both of these words are in the OED, including the capitalization of the later, however the city name of Buffalo is not. Now suppose some of their offspring are named Buffalo Buffalo. And suppose some of their offspring are named Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo.  This leads to English sentences such as ""Buffalo buffalo buffalo."", where the first lowercase word is the verb, to quote the OED, <em>""To overpower, overawe, or constrain by superior force or influence; to outwit, perplex.""</em>, and the second lowercase word is the common name of a species of quadrupeds.  Similarly, another sentence is: ""Buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo."", as is ""Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo."" And so on. Grammatically simple sentences of any arbitrary length can be formed.  Without this exclusion, the puzzle certainly has no ultimate answer.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A judge tells a condemned prisoner that he will be hanged at noon on
  one weekday in the following week but that the execution will be a
  surprise to the prisoner. He will not know the day of the hanging
  until the executioner knocks on his cell door at noon that day.</p>
  
  <p>Having reflected on his sentence, the prisoner draws the conclusion
  that he will escape from the hanging. His reasoning is in several
  parts. He begins by concluding that the ""surprise hanging"" can't be on
  Friday, as if he hasn't been hanged by Thursday, there is only one day
  left - and so it won't be a surprise if he's hanged on Friday. Since
  the judge's sentence stipulated that the hanging would be a surprise
  to him, he concludes it cannot occur on Friday.</p>
  
  <p>He then reasons that the surprise hanging cannot be on Thursday
  either, because Friday has already been eliminated and if he hasn't
  been hanged by Wednesday night, the hanging must occur on Thursday,
  making a Thursday hanging not a surprise either. By similar reasoning
  he concludes that the hanging can also not occur on Wednesday, Tuesday
  or Monday. Joyfully he retires to his cell confident that the hanging
  will not occur at all.</p>
  
  <p>The next week, the executioner knocks on the prisoner's door at noon
  on Wednesday — which, despite all the above, was an utter surprise to
  him. Everything the judge said came true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From this I ask:</p>

<ol>
<li>How is it that despite the prisoner's sound logic, the judge is correct just the same?</li>
<li>Assuming the prisoner is a logician, is it even possible for the judge to be wrong?</li>

Is solving a puzzle using uniqueness invalid?,"<p>(I don't know if this is appropriate to ask here, since it's a bit of a soft question about puzzles, rather than a puzzle itself. I'm not certain about the tags either.)</p>

<p>When I was first introduced to Sudoku, I was told, in no uncertain terms, that there had to be one and only one solution. The way I took that to mean is that any 9 by 9 grid with numbers 1 to 9 in it, that could be completed in multiple ways (or no ways at all) was not a Sudoku puzzle (maybe just a cruel joke to play on puzzlers).</p>

<p>Since then, I've found a whole bunch of similar kinds of puzzles, and often the same rule carries over: there can only be one solution. Even if it's not explicitly stated, people still feel cheated if there is more than one.</p>

<p>But, whenever I see people doing these kinds of puzzles, the techniques tend to ignore this requirement. They're usually quite direct, of the form ""in order for there to be even one solution, we must have ...."". I just don't see many techniques of the form ""this can't be this way, or else this will cause at least two solutions"".</p>

<p>It's not that these techniques can't be helpful. I have had experiences in the past where I haven't been able to crack a problem by these ""existence"" methods, but I can identify situations that would break uniqueness.</p>

<p>Here's a concrete example of a uniqueness method. Take the puzzle found <a href=""https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/singles.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> (you can play online). You have an n by n grid, filled with the numbers 1 to n. You are supposed to black out numbers in the grid, until the grid satisfies the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Each number shows up, without being blacked out, <strong>at most</strong> once.</li>
<li>No two adjacent (orthogonally, not diagonally) squares maybe blacked out.</li>
<li>The remaining white space must be connected (again, when moving orthogonally, not diagonoally). That is, you cannot ""wall off"" certain white spaces with diagonally connected black squares.</li>
</ol>

<p>and of course, there is only one solution.</p>

<p>Here's a rule we can deduce from uniqueness that cannot otherwise be deduced: if there is a number that does not have any duplicates in the row and column in which it is found, then that number cannot be blacked out.</p>

<p>Why? Because we can always elect not to black out a number, and the only rule violated is rule 1. If no duplicate number appears in the row/column, then even rule 1 cannot be violated. So, we have another, distinct solution, which is not acceptable. Therefore, the number could never be blacked out in the first place.</p>

<p>From there, you could even go further! You could say that either an orthogonally adjacent square must be blacked out, or at least two diagonally adjacent square must be blacked out.</p>

<p>You'll find this stuff out eventually with other methods, but that's not the point. When things get really difficult, we sometimes need to take progress when we can get it, and if uniqueness methods help, then why don't we use them?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>tldr: Many puzzles require that their solution be unique. Why don't more people use this fact to solve them?</p>

 - <a href=""https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/2034/a-set-of-water-jug-challenges"">A Set of Water Jug Challenges</a> <br>
 - <a href=""https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/8244/pouring-problem"">Pouring problem</a></p>

<p>Now I'm asking for a generalised solution to that problem.</p>

<p>I define the problem as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You are required to measure exactly $n$ litres of water.</p></li>
<li><p>You have $j$ jugs. </p></li>
<li><p>Each jug has volume $v_m$ where $m$ is the jug-number ($1$ to $j$). </p></li>
<li><p>You have an infinitely large tub of water.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no indication on the jugs saying how much liquid is in them, and you can't judge it by eye. You do know for sure when they are empty and when they are full.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Question(s):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For what sets of values ($n$, $j$, $v_1$ to $v_j$) is this solvable?</p></li>
<li><p>For cases which are solvable, what algorithm can be used to find the solution?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is intended to be a math/algorithm problem, rather than a lateral thinking problem, so 'creative' solutions such as ""<em>I use the infinitely-large tub of water to solve the world's drought problems, am elected world president for my services to humanity, and keep the jugs as a souvenir</em>"" may be upvoted if they're witty/entertaining but won't be marked as correct.</p>

<p><strong>NB</strong>: Searching the entire possible space of jug-pouring actions is clearly <em>a</em> solution. But it isn't a very interesting or elegant one. </p>

How could Larry get his friends on a plane without knowing their weights?,"<p>This riddle was inspired when I watched the latest (as of this post) episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm (S10E4), in which Larry is faced with a dilemma that he never really solved. The dilemma is as follows:</p>

<p>Larry is ordering a private airplane to fly to Mexico for him and his friends: Jeff, Susie, Cheryl, Leon, and Donna. For safety and fuel efficiency reasons, the pilot needs to know the weights of the passengers and their luggage. Getting the weights of luggage is no big deal. However, to get the weights of the passengers there's one problem:</p>

<p><em>None</em> of Larry's friends will allow anybody to know their weight. To each person, their weight is a very private matter that nobody can know, not even Larry, their partner, or the pilot. So they refuse to tell Larry (or anybody) their weight.</p>

<p>Assume you can easily solve this with the tools in your own home (e.g. no industrial-sized scale). Assume everybody knows their own weight.</p>

<p><strong>How does Larry give the pilot the information he needs, while respecting everybody's wish to keep their weight private?</strong></p>

<p>I have a solution in mind. However, any solution that works just as well should be just as valid. Watching the episode won't help you because Larry doesn't solve this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You all know your own monthly salary but not those of your colleagues.<br>
  If you can guess how much it costs me to pay all of you in one month you get a bonus. Otherwise I'll just take you out for beers, but no bonus.<br>
  You cannot ask the financial department. And you cannot find out how much the other people make a month.  </p>

<p>Now what strategy should we apply in order to know the total sum of the salaries per month? 
I really want the bonus.<br>
All I can tell you is that we are at least 3 employees and you can ignore the tax calculations. </p>

"Is ""meta""-logic valid for solving puzzles?","<p>I think this question is best explained with a demonstration. In this case I'm playing a <a href=""https://www.ossblog.org/range-limit-visible-distance-black-squares-puzzle-game/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Range</a> puzzle, but this kind of concept seems to work with other puzzle types too.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fZNd0.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fZNd0.png"" alt=""image of partially solved Range puzzle""></a></p>

<p>Of interest here are the two blank squares in the last row of the puzzle. Let's call the left of the two blank squares A, and the right B.</p>

<p>If square A is black, then square B must be white, since two black squares cannot be orthogonally adjacent.</p>

<p>If square A is white, then square B may be white <em>or</em> black, and the puzzle would still be in a valid state. No other restrictions are placed on square B.</p>

<p>Therefore, square A must be black, to guarantee a unique solution to the puzzle.</p>

<p>My question is, when solving puzzles, is this kind of logic <em>sound</em>? If I follow this logic through in other contexts, is it always guaranteed to produce a correct conclusion? Is there a name for this kind of logic?</p>
",93899,19-02-2020 19:55,Is solving a puzzle using uniqueness invalid?,"<p>(I don't know if this is appropriate to ask here, since it's a bit of a soft question about puzzles, rather than a puzzle itself. I'm not certain about the tags either.)</p>

<p>When I was first introduced to Sudoku, I was told, in no uncertain terms, that there had to be one and only one solution. The way I took that to mean is that any 9 by 9 grid with numbers 1 to 9 in it, that could be completed in multiple ways (or no ways at all) was not a Sudoku puzzle (maybe just a cruel joke to play on puzzlers).</p>

<p>Since then, I've found a whole bunch of similar kinds of puzzles, and often the same rule carries over: there can only be one solution. Even if it's not explicitly stated, people still feel cheated if there is more than one.</p>

<p>But, whenever I see people doing these kinds of puzzles, the techniques tend to ignore this requirement. They're usually quite direct, of the form ""in order for there to be even one solution, we must have ...."". I just don't see many techniques of the form ""this can't be this way, or else this will cause at least two solutions"".</p>

<p>It's not that these techniques can't be helpful. I have had experiences in the past where I haven't been able to crack a problem by these ""existence"" methods, but I can identify situations that would break uniqueness.</p>

<p>Here's a concrete example of a uniqueness method. Take the puzzle found <a href=""https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/singles.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> (you can play online). You have an n by n grid, filled with the numbers 1 to n. You are supposed to black out numbers in the grid, until the grid satisfies the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Each number shows up, without being blacked out, <strong>at most</strong> once.</li>
<li>No two adjacent (orthogonally, not diagonally) squares maybe blacked out.</li>
<li>The remaining white space must be connected (again, when moving orthogonally, not diagonoally). That is, you cannot ""wall off"" certain white spaces with diagonally connected black squares.</li>
</ol>

<p>and of course, there is only one solution.</p>

<p>Here's a rule we can deduce from uniqueness that cannot otherwise be deduced: if there is a number that does not have any duplicates in the row and column in which it is found, then that number cannot be blacked out.</p>

<p>Why? Because we can always elect not to black out a number, and the only rule violated is rule 1. If no duplicate number appears in the row/column, then even rule 1 cannot be violated. So, we have another, distinct solution, which is not acceptable. Therefore, the number could never be blacked out in the first place.</p>

<p>From there, you could even go further! You could say that either an orthogonally adjacent square must be blacked out, or at least two diagonally adjacent square must be blacked out.</p>

<p>You'll find this stuff out eventually with other methods, but that's not the point. When things get really difficult, we sometimes need to take progress when we can get it, and if uniqueness methods help, then why don't we use them?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>tldr: Many puzzles require that their solution be unique. Why don't more people use this fact to solve them?</p>

Guessing the coin flips,"<p>Two prisoners, Alice and Bob, are captured by a dragon and placed in separate, isolated cells. The dragon then flips an infinite number of fair coins, and tells the outcomes of odd throws to Alice and of even throws to Bob. He then asks Alice to name an even number and Bob an odd number. If the throws corresponding to the numbers were the same (both heads or both tails), they can both go free. Otherwise the dragon eats them. Alice and Bob cannot hear each other's answers (i.e. they answer simultaneously).</p>

One contained peppermint candies, another contained chocolate candies, and the remaining contained peppermint candies and chocolate candies mixed. All the candies had the same packaging, so without tasting them it was impossible to tell which kind of candy it was.</p>

Each basket is closed and is labeled with ‘Apples’, ‘Oranges’ and ‘Apples and Oranges’. However, each of these labels is always placed incorrectly. How would you pick only one fruit from a basket to place the labels correctly on all the baskets? This happens to be usually the basic version of the problem Modification: What if no basket is labelled can we still label all the baskets. And if so how?</p>

<p>Analysis: Well its easy to label one of the 3 baskets as apples or oranges after 3 picks one each from one basket. But now we have a dilemma how to chose which is the random basket and which is the specific one(apples or oranges) from the two remaining baskets. And in the worst case all our picks will result in the same output. So I was wondering if there is any way we could label them and if not the worst case can we at least get a relation based on the distribution and probability of the apples and oranges in the random basket.</p>

You are given a timer of 4 minutes, and a timer of 7 minutes.  The time starts when the first timer is flipped.  Is there a time for which all larger integer values of time can be measured?  Prove why or why not.</p>

Same rules as above, but now your timers are 6 minutes and 11 minutes.</p>

N pirates on ship,"<p>I have a question quite similar to the 5 pirates and 100 coins puzzle, but mine is slightly different. Hopefully you can help me understand, because this question is a doozie.</p>

<p>There are N pirates on a ship, who have found 3 pieces of gold. Each pirate has the following priorities:</p>

<p>Life > Gold > Watching a pirate walk on a plank > Nothing</p>

<p>Essentially, each pirate values their own life over gold, and would rather win gold than watching their fellow pirates walk the plank. However, each pirate is definitely bloodthirsty, and would rather watch their peers die by the plank if anything. Also, do note that each pirate is infinitely intelligent and will make perfect decisions, if one exists.</p>

<p>The Nth pirate must make a division of gold across all N pirates.</p>

<p>If 50% or more are in favor of the proposed distribution of gold, then that pirate survives, and the planned gold distribution is carried out. If not, the pirate walks the plank, and the (N-1)th pirate is the next to propose a distribution.</p>

<p>Whats the maximum number of pirates that can survive on the vessel?</p>
",45336,02-11-2016 22:40,Pirates and gold coins,"<p>A group of N pirates has come by a chest containing 200 gold coins.  Their rules require that the coins be distributed by the following approach.  The pirates are ranked from fiercest to meekest and all pirates know the ranking.  The fiercest must propose a division, which is put to majority vote with the fiercest voting and winning ties.  If the proposal wins, it is implemented.  If not, the fiercest is fed to the sharks and the responsibility falls to the (newly promoted) fiercest.  The pirates are selfish and quite rational, with the following priorities:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Stay alive</li>
<li>Get as much gold as possible, as long as 1 is satisfied</li>
<li>If 1 is satisfied and two options are equivalent in terms of gold, feed somebody to the sharks by preference.</li>
</ol>

Logic Coin Question,"<p>Please view comments to see how it is not a duplicate....
I am looking at it from a CPU perspective.</p>

<p>If there are 23 coins that are on a screen, and there are two players and you get to pick if you go first or second, how can you guarantee that you will not get stuck with picking the last coin? Basically, the objective is to force the other person to pick the last coin.</p>

<p>every turn you can pick 1 or 2 coins</p>

 - <a href=""https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/8244/pouring-problem"">Pouring problem</a></p>

<p>Now I'm asking for a generalised solution to that problem.</p>

<p>I define the problem as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You are required to measure exactly $n$ litres of water.</p></li>
<li><p>You have $j$ jugs. </p></li>
<li><p>Each jug has volume $v_m$ where $m$ is the jug-number ($1$ to $j$). </p></li>
<li><p>You have an infinitely large tub of water.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no indication on the jugs saying how much liquid is in them, and you can't judge it by eye. You do know for sure when they are empty and when they are full.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Question(s):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For what sets of values ($n$, $j$, $v_1$ to $v_j$) is this solvable?</p></li>
<li><p>For cases which are solvable, what algorithm can be used to find the solution?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is intended to be a math/algorithm problem, rather than a lateral thinking problem, so 'creative' solutions such as ""<em>I use the infinitely-large tub of water to solve the world's drought problems, am elected world president for my services to humanity, and keep the jugs as a souvenir</em>"" may be upvoted if they're witty/entertaining but won't be marked as correct.</p>

<p><strong>NB</strong>: Searching the entire possible space of jug-pouring actions is clearly <em>a</em> solution. But it isn't a very interesting or elegant one. </p>

<p>Your job is to fill in mathematical operators in order to make all equations true.</p>

<ol>
<li>You can not connect two digits into one number. So for example you cannot connect two fives into fifty five. Each digit is it's own separate number.</li>
<li>You cannot add in more numbers, including in operators. So squaring is invalid, because in order to square you need to add in the number two. A square root is allowed, but not any other root that requires additional numbers.</li>
<li>A square root of a square root is a fourth root, which is also not allowed</li>
<li>You cannot change anything but the left side of the equation</li>
<li>Functions such as sine, tangent etc. Are not allowed.</li>
<li>Using ^ is not accepted</li>

Most Difficult Riddle I've Heard,"<p>My friend told me this riddle, and I have been struggling for weeks to find the answer.</p>

<p><strong>Riddle:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are in a circular room, the size doesn't matter. Meaning, the room
  could be 5 feet in circumference or billions of miles in
  circumference. There are lights periodically, but evenly placed in the
  room with switches that can turn them on and off, however, the lights
  originally start off in an either on or off position, in a random
  order. You can walk anywhere in the room, but you can only see the 4
  or 5 lights in front of you (you can't see every light in the room at
  the same time). You don't need to find how many lights are in the
  room, but, what is the METHOD for finding out how many lights there
  are?</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can't break the lights or spit on walls or take off your clothes
  to mark your location in any way possible. Also, the fact that they
  are lights is NOT important. It's important that it's a binary code
  that can be a random sequence of 1's and 0's. It's also NOT important
  that it's a room, but it is important that it is circular. For
  example, it could be a table with pennies periodically placed around
  the edges with them faced on heads or tails. However, it's easier to
  imagine it as a room. Since it's binary, you also have to assume that
  there is any possible combination, and the method of just walking
  around the whole room and counting and turning on all the lights won't
  work, because it's possible to believe that you have reached the end
  when you reach a random stretch of lights that are already turned on.</p>

What is the upper bound for n, if m coins are allowed to flip?</p>

<p>Puzzle:</p>

<p>You and your friend are imprisoned. Your jailer offers a challenge. If you complete the challenge you are both free to go. The rules are</p>

<p>The jailer will take you into a private cell. In the cell will be a chessboard and a jar containing 64 coins.
The jailer will take the coins, one-by-one, and place a coin on each square on the board. He will place the coins randomly on the board. Some coins will be heads, and some tails (or maybe they will be all heads, or all tails; you have no idea. It's all at the jailers whim. He may elect to look and choose to make a pattern himself, he may toss them placing them the way they land, he might look at them as he places them, he might not …). If you attempt to interfere with the placing of the coins, it is instant death for you. If you attempt to coerce, suggest, or persuade the jailer in any way, instant death. All you can do it watch.
Once all the coins have been laid out, the jailer will point to one of the squares on the board and say: “This one!” He is indicating the magic square. This square is the key to your freedom.
The jailer will then allow you to turn over one coin on the board. Just one. A single coin, but it can be any coin, you have full choice. If the coin you select is a head, it will flip to a tail. If it is a tail it will flip to a head. This is the only change you are allowed to make to the jailers initial layout.
You will then be lead out of the room. If you attempt to leave other messages behind, or clues for your friend … yes, you guessed it, instant death!
The jailer will then bring your friend into the room.
Your friend will look at the board (no touching allowed), then examine the board of coins and decide which location he thinks is the magic square.
He gets one chance only (no feedback). Based on the configuration of the coins he will point to one square and say: “This one!”
If he guesses correctly, you are both pardoned, and instantly set free. If he guesses incorrectly, you are both executed.
The jailer explains all these rules, to both you and your friend, beforehand and then gives you time to confer with each other to devise a strategy for which coin to flip.</p>
