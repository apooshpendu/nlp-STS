Using 14 ga on part of a 20A circuit?,"<p>I'm building an outdoor bbq and have a 20A circuit with 2 runs - 1 for outlets and 1 for lights. The outlets are done with 20A receptacles and 12 ga wire inside 1/2"" emc.</p>

<p>The lights will be hanging pull lights (16 ga wire in the cord) and because it's a little cheaper and easier, I wanted to get power to the fixtures by 14 ga wire, also in 1/2"" emc.</p>

<p>Is this a no-no? The only thing on this run would be 5 lights, so very low load.</p>

I am actually running new wire to the fluorescent fixtures from a 100amp sub panel in the basement, and not reusing then existing wiring that goes to the current light.</p>

<p>As I was taking the porcelain fixture down I discovered that there is 14 gauge wire going to it - ok.  There are 3 such fixtures in the basement.  There are also other things on this same breaker upstairs in the main living part of the house - 3 or 4 outlets that are on 12 gauge wire.  The breaker is a 20 amp breaker for all of these.  Is this ok to mix 14 &amp; gauge wire like this?  If not, why did they do it?</p>

How to protect a new wood floor from renovation traffic,"<p>I have had hardwood flooring installed in my home, with further renovation (kitchen) upcoming. The kitchen floor is tile which I'm not worried about, but to get to and from the kitchen means travelling over the hardwood (urethane finish). The installers used cardboard from the shipping boxes to protect the floor as they were working over it. To keep the cardboard from sliding around, it was taped down with painter's tape. It only took them a few days to complete the work, after which I had no trouble removing the tape. The kitchen work is another matter; there will be activity spread over a few weeks. </p>

<p>I'm thinking of using the same technique as the flooring installers - lay down cardboard and secure with painter's tape, but I've read that you can only rely on 7-14 day release. Is this true? Will I have problems removing the tape from the flooring if left in place for 3-4 weeks? Will it damage, discolor or cloud the finish if left that long?</p>

",108384,10-02-2017 04:48,Determine if wire in switch box is safe to re-purpose?,"<p>I need to pull a neutral wire to my light switch for a smart switch.  It's presently switching an outlet that I don't need switched, and the other side of the outlet already has unswitched power.  My plan is to use a smart switch, which requires neutral, to control a different device wirelessly.  </p>

<p>I can't feasibly run a new wire, because the wires aren't run through conduit.  Instead, my plan is to repurpose the switched wire to get neutral from the outlet.  </p>

<p>The switch, which controls an outlet has two wires, one black and one red.  The switched outlet has a white neutral wire, plus the red and black wires that I assume run directly to the switch.</p>

<p>I've completely disconnected the red and black wires from the outlet and the switch.  The black wire is measuring 120V AC when measured against ground using the box as ground, both at the outlet and at the switch. Using my DMM, the red wire is measuring 24V AC with respect to the box/ground at both sides.  I assume this is a <a href=""http://www.fluke.com/fluke/uses/comunidad/fluke-news-plus/articlecategories/electrical/dualimpedance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ghost voltage</a> caused by induction from the charged black wire over to the floating red wire.  </p>

<p>Our house is ~100 years old and this particular switch seems to be run using armored cable (note the paper wrap around each wire.)  There are literally only two wires in the switch box; no wire nuts.  </p>

<p>If relevant, we do have some old knob and tube wiring active, but I'm pretty confident there's none on this circuit.</p>

<p>Is there some way I can determine with enough confidence that the red wire isn't connected elsewhere such that I can know it's safe to connect the red wire at the outlet to netural?</p>

Installing electrical box in 2x4,"<p>I'm designing a custom headboard for our bed and I want to install electrical into the cubbies I am making in the headboard (primarily for cell phone charging). In my current design, the electrical box would be installed into a cut out 2x4.</p>

My primary question is this: <strong>Are there any U.S. electrical codes or even best practices I need to be aware of in regards to where and into what material I can install an electrical box?</strong> The only thing I could find was that a box can protrude through up to 1/2"" of drywall, so I'm wondering if that means that attempting to protrude through a larger (flammable) piece of material like this is against code. If you have any other related advice/caution about running electrical into furniture, that would be welcomed as well. Thanks!</p>

Push in vs Wire Nuts?,"<p>So I've been doing a lot of ""smart switch"" upgrades around the home. A lot of z-wave and lutron stuff. If anyone is familiar with installing these they take up a TON of space compared to a normal manual light switch (especially when there are two in a 2-gang box).</p>

<p>I always feel uncomfortable stuffing the mass of wires back in, and wire nuts don't make it any easier. Especially when you are making multiple connections.</p>

",182738,18-01-2020 03:23,Are push in connectors up to code?,"<p>Just came across a neat product at the local hardware store, but I wonder if they are up to code and safe to use.  They are a wire nut that allows you to simply push the wires in, instead of twisting on a traditional wire nut.</p>

<p>They cost slightly more, and you have to keep a wider variety of connectors on hand since they vary by the number of wires that can be connected.  </p>

<p>they accept 12-22 AWG solid and 12-22 AWG stranded wire, and are rated at 600 VAC.  They come in a variety of sizes from 2 - 8 'ports', so they should be up to any job.</p>

<h1>UPDATE:</h1>

<p>I finally got my hands on some of these things, and I'll tell you what. If you can pull the wires out through normal means once they're locked in, you deserve some type of prize.  I did find a way to pull the wires out, but I doubt they'll ever see enough movement while in use to allow the wires to slip out.  If you spin the wires back and forth while you pull, they will eventually work their way out (this is the official way to remove wires <a href=""http://diy.blogoverflow.com/2012/01/tool-review-ideal-in-sure-push-in-wire-connectors/#comment-71253"">according to an IDEAL spokesperson</a>).  Doing this chews the wire up pretty bad, leaving a bunch of nicks along the length of the wire.</p>

<p>They say not to reuse them, and I can see why. Removing the wire can leave fairly deep gouges in the wire. If you ever have to remove them, you'll likely have to trim the wire back and restrip it. However, Even after torturing them (including taking them apart), they still held the wire when it was reinserted.</p>

<p>So as long as your wiring is not subjected to constant twisting and pulling, you should have no problems with wires pulling out of these things.</p>

<h1>UPDATE:</h1>

<p>I think I finally found the relevant section in the code that would apply to these devices.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h1>National Electrical Code 2014</h1>
  
  <h2>Article 110 - Requirements for Electrical Installations</h2>
  
  <h3>I. General</h3>
  
  <p><strong>110.14 Electrical Connections.</strong>  </p>
  
  <p><strong>(B) Splices.</strong> <code>Conductors shall be spliced or joined with splicing devices identiﬁed for the use</code> or by brazing, welding,
  or soldering with a fusible metal or alloy. Soldered splices shall
  ﬁrst be spliced or joined so as to be mechanically and electrically
  secure without solder and then be soldered. <code>All splices and joints
  and the free ends of conductors shall be covered with an insulation
  equivalent to that of the conductors or with an identified insulating device.</code>  </p>
  
  <p>Wire connectors or splicing means
  installed on conductors for direct burial shall be listed for such
  use.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would say these devices fit both criteria. They are identified for the use, and they provide insulation equivalent to the conductors. </p>

Can I vent plumbing in an old house to the crawl space?,"<p>I have an old farmhouse with a bathroom vanity, laundry room, and kitchen sink/dishwasher draining into a single septic run. There aren’t any vents installed in the system with only a crawl space under the two rooms. Is there a way to add a vent in the crawl space or without running it up through the walls or ceiling?</p>

<p>I'll need to add a washer drain to the garage for the washer. Because this will need a p-trap, my understanding is that it also needs to be vented. </p>

<p>I could go straight up into the attic then through the roof, but my question is: do I need to actually go through the roof? Could I instead have it go into the attic then 90 degree it out to the back, second floor wall? I can't find any particular code rules on if it has to penetrate the roof or not. This is a septic system, if that matters. </p>

<p>The reason for trying to avoid the roof is that I'd prefer to not climb up onto the roof...it's about 45 degrees and in the PNW so perpetually wet and mossy. </p>

Basement plumbing vent,"<p>RE: I am installings a basement bath (toilet, shower and sink) Saniflo macerating  pump system.
The house has a 3"" vent pipe going from the basement ceiling thru the roof to vent the pump system into.
However, there are 2 vanities on the first floor above the basement using this 3"" vent pipe for both their drains and vents. 
Question 1:  Since the vanities use the vent as a drain (for about 2 feet) from the first floor (above the basement), can the pump system be workably vented into it.
Question 2:  Is the only possible drawback being the fact that the basement pump vent may be impeded when the vanities are draining?(not asking about any codes) Thanks</p>

Split sub-panel box with dual feeds?,"<p>Is this a thing? Kinda goes with my first question on here. Again i am not an electrician nor will i be doing the work. I am the builder and owner. In the designing stages of a tiny house on wheels and im trying to figure out if we will be able to have two feeds coming in. one 20amp and one 30. on separate circuits but in the same box?</p>

<p>So are split sub panels with dual feeds a thing? thats my question</p>

<p>Running solely off a 30 amp service would be really really tight given what we need to run. Mostly propane for the larger pulls but no need for a 50amp 240 nor do we have that set up like we already do with an existing 30amp rv hookup on site.

NOTE : I will be hiring a professional electrician to carry out the work but for now I'm looking for a better understanding of how this will all work.</p>

<p>Pretty much what I'm looking for is a sub-panel that will have two feeds powering it. One 20 amp regular heavy duty extension and one 30amp RV extension. Is it possible to have two feeds into a sub-panel like this? and have two separate circuits inside? My reasoning is for future purposes, either a small solar setup and even a generator during blackouts on the smaller 20amp circuit while keeping the 30amp on grid for our larger draw uses.</p>

<p>What kind of panel would i be looking for here?
Or which direction should i be starting?
Everything is 120V. </p>

Does the NEC allow splices inside a load center (main circuit breaker panel)?,"<p>I have built a detached garage which will have a 125A subpanel. (125A panel because it will double as a work shop with A/C and heat and power equipment). Power will brought in from the house load meter panel which only has 12 spaces which are all taken. In fact, several spaces are occupied by tandem breakers to carrying 220V circuits requiring the second hot leg to be carried by another tandem breaker with a space in between in order to pick up the other side of the bus. (I think this is illegal or should be. This is the way the panel was wired when we purchased it).  </p>

<p>With the second panel installed adjacent to the meter base, I plan to get rid of all tandem breakers (which I do not like anyway) and move several breakers to the new panel which has 24 spaces, freeing up spaces in the meter base panel where I will install the 125A breaker to power the subpanel in my detached garage. </p>

<p>Moving these circuits to the new panel will require splicing wires in order to reach the new panel breakers. My question is: Does NEC code allow for splices inside the circuit breaker panel? Are there special type splices needed for this situation or are wire nuts allowed? All splices will be done correctly and taped. A master electrician and electrical engineer have said it is legal but a NEC reference, page and paragraph, would be helpful incase my inspector objects. </p>

After getting the panel open and moving one circuit to a new, 15A single pole (non-CAFCI), I discovered that my second circuit, the one I want on the CAFCI, has too short of a neutral wire to reach the CAFCI breaker's neutral screw.  It looks to have been shortened to be just long enough to reach the neutral bus bar.</p>

<p>Is it against code to splice/pigtail a new, short piece of romex onto the existing neutral (w/ a wire cap) so I can connect it to the CAFCI's neutral screw?</p>

Leviton Vizia 24 hr timer - How do I install?,"<p>I bought a Leviton timer and when I went to install it, I ran into a problem. The outlet box has ONLY three wires - Black, White and a bare copper ground. Looking at the wiring diagram for the Leviton timer, I don't know where the RD wire is supposed to be connected. I connected the Black from the box to the Black on the timer, and similarly White to White on the timer. When switched on, the timer lights up and I can hear a click but the outside light does not turn on. That's because the Red wire from the timer is not connected. Can someone please help me figure this out? I am replacing the currently installed timer with this Leviton one. But the previous timer had only 3 wires - black, white and ground. So I had no problem installing that previous one. Am attaching a pic to show my arrangement.

<p>Situation is, we got our water heater replaced a few years back and ever since this has been an issue. It's more noticeable when it's cold outside it seems, but still seems to be a year round problem. Whenever we  use hot water, we basically run out of it within minutes. In order to get an acceptable amount of hot water (enough to take a 10 minute shower), we literally have to prime the water first. By that I mean I have to turn on the hot water, let it run for a couple of minutes, then turn it off and wait 20 minutes. Then when we go to use the hot water again we'll get hot water for a respectable amount of time. Now I am fairly ignorant to all this, but it seems a 71 gallon hot water heater should be capable of holding enough water to not need to be primed like this. I should be able to take a 30 minute shower, let alone 10 without running out. My shower this morning was decently warm for maybe 2 minutes before it was just warm-ish. </p>

<p>So if anyone can give me some ideas on what might be going on I would appreciate it. We've just put up with this for some years assuming perhaps it was some eco friendly thing. Like the system doesn't maintain much hot water in the tank so it's not always running and only heats water up when you start to use it? I hope that isn't the case though and even so, I should be able to get more hot water out of it. Any help?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> Sorry everyone, I meant to tell you all that the water heater was gas. The pilot light is lit. I don't recall the specific model though I can look that up if people think it will help. I have actually turned up the thermostat on it above the default and when the water heater is putting out hot water, it can be very hot. Too hot. But again, that requires us to prime it before we get any decent amount of hot water out.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong> Looked it up, I believe this is the model info if that helps anyone: State Select: High Output. Model number: GS675XRRS 300</p>

",130652,10-01-2018 19:15,Kitchen Installation new build: How long after heat goes on?,"<p><strong>In Short</strong></p>

<p>Our kitchen suppliers have told us that the kitchen should only go in 6-8 weeks after the heat has been turned on in our new build. Their concern is how dry the house is, I assume the issue they're talking about (in technical terms) is relative humidity? Would I be right in saying as long as we are achieving a reading of 50% or less humidity-wise, there should be no issue?</p>

<p>The reason I ask is we're working off a deadline which will only allow us 5 1/2 weeks of lead time with the heating on otherwise the whole thing gets pushed back 1-2 months.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR - A bit more background below</strong></p>

<p>House Area: 250m2
Construction Type: Concrete Block</p>

<p>Our floors have been poured 4 weeks ago:</p>

<ul>
<li>Upstairs: 50mm liquid screed</li>
<li>Downstairs: 100mm sand and cement</li>
</ul>

<p>The plastering was completed 5 weeks ago (gypsum all around and skim on ceilings)</p>

<p>I have been opening all the windows during the day and removing all condensation with a window vacuum before I close them up again at night.</p>

<p>For the past week the house has been receiving heat at night via 2 x 2.5kw heaters running for 8 hours.</p>

<p>The heating is to be provided by a heat pump (air to water) and distributed via underfloor heating, we also have a heat recovery system which should take some moisture out.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>

<p>We've be told not to install dehumidifiers as it will crack the plaster, so is there anything else we should be trying or anything that we <em>are</em> doing and should stop?</p>

<p>Another suggestion was to isolate the heat to the kitchen by taping up openings to other rooms? My thinking was the moisture would be drawn from other rooms once these temp barriers were removed?</p>

Replace existing swamp cooler thermostat with smart thermostat - any special differences between the two thermostat types in this application?,"<p>Has anyone replaced their swamp / evaporative cooler's <strong>existing</strong> <strong>thermostat</strong> with a smart WiFi-connected thermostat like Nest or Ecobee? </p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
",186679,15-03-2020 19:01,Controlling 110v swamp cooler using Nest thermostat,"<p>I currently have an HVAC system that is connected to a Nest thermostat (2nd generation) and I'm planning to use the same Nest thermostat to control a 110 swamp cooler that is currently not connected.</p>

<p>Before dealing with the trouble to connect both systems to the same thermostat (maybe using switches/relays to shut down one system while the other is on) I want to know if it possible to control the swamp cooler using the Nest thermostat. I don't have too much electrical knowledge, but I've been doing some research and I think it is possible if I buy some additional things.</p>

<p>The swamp cooler has a 2-speed motor, therefore I would like the Nest thermostat to control both speeds using Y1 and Y2 terminals. As far as I know 2 stage thermostats will apply power from the R terminal to the Y2 if more cooling power is required at the same time power is applied from R terminal to Y1. I also want the water pump to work everytime the thermostat calls for cooling (for both speeds), but I want the water pump to run alone for some minutes before the motor is started.</p>

<p>I have found that the Honeywell RC840T-120 might allow me to use the 24v Nest thermostat with the 110v swamp cooler and using a SPDT relay I could connect Y1 and Y2 to the 2 terminals of the 2-speed motor. Honeywell RC840T-120 was created to connect line-voltage controlled heaters to 24v thermostats but I think it will also work with the swamp cooler. This device will be the first relay that will decide if the pump and motor are going to receive power. This first relay will be connected to a PTD102 Delay that will delay the power to the SPDT relay, this last realy is the one that will control the power to the motor based on Y2 terminal from Nest thermostat. The thermostat will send power to Y1 only for 1st speed and in case it needs more cooling power it will start  sending power to Y1 and Y2 at the same time causing the SPDT relay to switch power to High through terminal 3 as the following diagram shows:</p>

<p>Please let me know if you think this way to connect the thermostat will allow me to control the swamp cooler and if it will also control both speeds</p>

Can you run a ground wire from stove directly to ground pole in the ground,"<p>Directly to ground pole outside drove into ground</p>
",159304,07-03-2019 14:19,Can I use a ground rod as an equipment ground for a detached garage?,"<p>I'm in a bit of a dilemma.  The house we bought has a detached garage supplied by 12/3 UF with ground.  The previous owner/handyman set this up as a multiwire branch circuit (MWBC) with a twist: one of the conductors is fed from the main panel in the basement to create a 20A circuit in the garage for plugs, but two other conductors in the 12/3 UF are used as switch legs for a 3-way switch, enabling the garage lights to be turned off either from the house or from the garage.  This leaves the equipment grounding conductor to be used as a shared neutral for both the plugs and the lights in the garage - definitely not code compliant, probably a bad idea all around.  The EGCs of the NM cables that feed the lights and plugs in the garage are tied together in a box in the garage, and not bonded to the makeshift neutral (EGC of the 12/3UF), as far as I can tell - so there is no true safety ground for the garage outlets.</p>

<p>I am not ready to dig up the yard and re-feed the garage, which will probably be the ultimate solution: reclaiming the 12/3 for only the lights, and adding thicker conductors in the trench for a proper subpanel in the garage.  I also realize that the easiest short-term solution would most likely be to rearrange the existing wiring connections to make either a single 20A circuit on a 3-way switch for all lights and plugs in the garage, or a single always-on circuit in the garage, to which I could connect the plugs and the lights, with a switch in the garage for the lights.  The first of these choices is not an option because the garage door opener needs to be always live for use with the car remote, and the second choice, though preferable, loses the significant advantage of the 3-way switch.</p>

<p>In general, I'm ok with using the ground of the 12/3 UF as neutral on a temporary basis because of the tough nature of UF cable, and because it hasn't caused any obvious problems yet.  I'm thinking of driving a grounding electrode at the garage and connecting the equipment grounding conductors of the branches in the garage to that electrode, which wouldn't be bonded to the neutral.  I know this would not be code-compliant, but I wonder if it would be an improvement.  I'm also wondering if GFI protection of either/both of the branch circuits in the garage would be possible and preferable - though I know that using GFIs on MWBC creates new issues.  </p>

<p>Again, I'm not yet ready to dig up the existing cable, and not willing to run anything overhead.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Thanks!

Removing a load bearing wall,"<p>We're remodeling our bathroom and I would like to remove a wall that appears to be there for looks because of the style in the late 60s. I'm wondering if there is any possibility that this wall is a load bearing wall or if I'll have any issues when I remove it. It appears to be more of a decorative wall to me but I would like a second opinion.

There are 3 or 4 ceiling joist that cross the wall and I plan to replace 1 (maybe more) of the ceiling joist because we found some termite damage when we pulled off the drywall. Any help would be greatly appreciated! </p>

<p>Well, like any project I get myself into, things didn't go as planned. The two switches on the left come from one circuit with the neutral bundle, the switch on the right is on a different circuit and there's no neutral.</p>

I was unaware of the equipment in the attic, which I discover all the wrong  wiring connections from the lights. i have work as a electrician and i have never see anything like this. Alot of fiberglass and tapes. </p>
",157399,12-02-2019 13:23,What's my health situation like living in an exposed fiberglass insulation for 2 weeks,"<p>My attic floor is covered with fiberglass insulation. I go to the attic very often. Sorting out winter/summer clothes. Or I go up to search for stuff as my attic is a short term storage. </p>

<p>2 weeks ago, we had water damage up in the attic which softened the floor and the ceiling of my son's room. A quarter of the ceiling collapsed and exposed some of fiberglass insulation. To dry up the wetness, windows were opened all the time. I am worried that particles of the fiberglass are all spread out throughout the house, through the ventilation, and my family may have been inhaling it for too long (2 weeks). </p>

<p>My hubby had a severe nose bleed the other day which required him to seek urgent help. At the hospital, they found out his big vein had burst. The bleeding only stopped after his nose was cultured . Now I wonder if we have all accumulated a handful of fiberglass in our lungs.  In particular I'm worried about my son's health in particular as he's only 14 years old. I have been having some pinching-like discomfort in my chest down to my abdomen and funny feeling in my mouth; a burning sensation.</p>

<p>I do not know if we should be at home while the ceiling will be ripped off... is it risky?</p>

<p>Insurance is carrying out the repairs.  Anything else I have to be aware off?</p>

Why do I see only 50 volts on my live wires?,"<p>I'm trying install a lamp to my apartment but it didn't light up as I expected. I recently moved in and this is the first time I'm trying to install a lamp here. The spot where I'm trying to install the lamp is just a hole in the ceiling with three wires hanging out: Two brown (live?) and one blue (neutral?). Some Googling revealed to me that the separate live wires can be used to control specific bulbs in a multi-bulb lamp. Nearby there is a switch on the wall with two buttons which I assume is for these wires. So apparently the idea is that current flows from each live wire through the bulbs to the common neutral wire when to buttons are toggled on. One live wire and the neutral were connected in parallel to a connection strip, while the other live wire was connected alone to its own connection strip.</p>

<p>My lamp has a spring-powered connection strip with L and N labeled holes so I simply took one of the brown wires to L and the blue wire to N.</p>

<p>I removed the connection strips and tried to measure the voltage to see if the problem was somewhere else in the circuit, and I noticed that each of the live wires measures around 50-54 volts with respect to the neutral, even though the AC line voltage in my country is 240 volts. Even stranger, I measured this voltage regardless of the positions of the switch buttons! Only when I removed the fuse I got 0 volts.</p>

<p>So I assume the reason why the lamp didn't light up was that the voltage was way too low. Could somebody point what is it that I'm doing wrong, or is there something wrong with the wiring on my apartment?</p>
",133624,26-02-2018 20:17,Why do I only have 30V going to my light fixture,"<p>I just replaced a broken light fixture in my closet. (The switch in the light fixture broke when I pulled too hard on the chain.) </p>

<p>When replacing the light fixture I noticed that there is only 30 V AC between the white and black wires. The ground wire is cut back and is not being used. By the way, the wiring in my house is all aluminum. </p>

<p>I know the new light fixture works. I checked it out with my multimeter, and I tried it in a different closet. But the light bulb won't turn on because there is only 30 V. (Even if I disconnect the light fixture completely there is still only 30 V. </p>

Are 15A receptacles acceptable on a 20A circuit?,"<p>I have a 20 amp breaker for my dedicated man cave home theater. It's a rental unit. Recently I had a few loose-fitting plugs on some of the receptacles so I just went downstairs and found the breaker and saw it was 20 amps. </p>

Is it ok to leave it like it is with both 15 and 20 amp receptacles in that room on the 20 amp breaker and if so what's the max amps i can pull through that circuit? </p>

<p>I think the 15 amp receptacles are on each end of the rooms circuit and the 20's are in the middle. Will that matter in any way? Right now i am pulling around 11-12 amps from that room but most is on a better quality power strip rated at 15 amps. Thanks in advance for the help.</p>

<p>Looking around on the web suggests that replacing the oven is the most common solution, but that seems extreme!  Any suggestions?</p>

<p>(In this case the oven is a ""Viking Professional"" (bottom of the line) 4 burner + oven freestanding range. I haven't yet been able to pull it out enough to check if it has removable panels or been able to find a manual online.)</p>

<p>I'm guessing the answer will be something like:</p>

<li>locate the manual for your appliance</li>
<li>remove access panels</li>
<li>remove insulation while being careful about ??</li>
<li>remove insulation that is ""stuck"" by doing ??</li>

In my design I settled on a hexagon as the logical shape for the frame, which I am considering for masonry construction. This would be a big house, each side being at least 30 feet wide (footprint 2340 sq ft). The advantages of a hexagon are obvious: simple roof shape, no valleys, space efficient, heat efficient (this would be in New England and subject to cold winters), good wind resistance.</p>

<p>What I can't understand is why there seems to be no-one building hexagonal houses? The only notable building I could find at all was the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Possible explanations would be that the shape is expensive for small houses due to the 6 corners, but for a large house like mine the room shapes work out fine, in fact they are better than a box house. Maybe its just tradition? People don't like it because it looks like church? Builders have some objection to 60-degree angles?</p>

1 bathroom is along an outside wall of the house.
1 bathroom is in the middle of the house with a support beam running along one wall (beam runs the whole length of the house).
Bathrooms share a wall in between them (total span of 10ft from outside wall to middle support beam of the house).
Both bathrooms are on the 2nd floor.
both bathrooms are above another heated/insulated room.
16in joist spacing.
I don't know how big the joists are because I haven't removed the existing subfloor yet.
We will most likely be installing ceramic tile.</p>

The chart linked to in one answer suggests looking at ambient temp ratings. I'm slightly out of my element there as all of the amp/gauge charts I've looked at in the past only considered length of conductor, because when length increases so does resistance, which means there's a drop in voltage.

Wiring ceiling light from switch that controls outlet,"<p>I am trying to add a ceiling light to a switch that currently controls a floor outlet (top plug only).  Coming into the light switch are a ground, a hot and a switched hot.  I have pulled an additional 12/2 wire from the ceiling light into the switch box and was wondering how I could wire it in to control both the outlet as it currently is, as well as the ceiling light.</p>

<p>The wire pulls into the attic are pretty difficult as there is 18"" of insulation and plaster, so avoiding another pull to the outlet would be preferable, but I understand you gotta do what you gotta do.</p>

Is this wiring safe,"<p>The wall box is from the mid-1950's and my multimeter shows that it is grounded. There are a solid 120 volts when testing between live and ground. I noticed a bare copper wire coming from the cloth wiring in the back tied to a screw connected to the box. I looked around for usable screw holes in the box to screw a ground screw into but they were all way too large. Does this look okay? I get good continuity here between the green insulated copper ground wire I added and the rest of the box.  The green wire will go to the grounding screw on the outlet.

<p><strong>Are 15A 3-prong grounded outlets actually rated to 20A, allowing them to be used on 20A circuits? And if so, why, when the outlet can never be asked to supply more than 15A by anything that would be plugged into it?</strong></p>

<p>More info:</p>

<p><a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/11803/would-there-be-a-problem-installing-20a-switches-on-a-15a-circuit"">This question</a> had a comment that 15A outlets were actually rated to 20A. However, by design, there is nothing that will plug into a 15A outlet that will draw more than 15A. An appliance that draws more than 15 amps would have a ""T-blade"" plug that wouldn't go into a standard 15A outlet. </p>

<p>In addition, outlets are always wired in parallel, meaning that a 15A outlet would never have to transmit the amperage draw of a ""downstream"" outlet; you never ""daisy-chain"" outlets by connecting hot to neutral, for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>So, there is AFAIK no situation in which a 15A receptacle would ever have to handle more than 15A, even if installed on a 12AWG, 20A-breaker circuit.</p>

<p>If all the above is true, why would a 15A receptacle even have to be rated to 20A?</p>

"Replacing a 1963 GE 125 Amp, 240V service panel","<p>In a recent question I asked about finding parts for my old 1960s electrical panel. I've given up on finding parts, and this new question is about replacing it with a new, modern panel:</p>

<p>One of the lugs burned up in my house's service panel. It was installed when the house was built in 1963. The lug is integral to the panel, and the panel is no longer available. I've looked for used panels of that model -- a GE TRX2012F -- but did not find any. So I'm told I need a new service panel. </p>

<p>I want to do the replacement myself. I've done minor DYI electrical work but nothing this involved. I'm reading and watching what I can find on replacing electrical panels. Can anyone offer answers to any of my questions below?</p>

<p>1) First, any suggestions on what panel to choose? The current one is installed flush in an unfinished stud wall. But surface-mount on top of the studs sounds fine to me too. There is about 14.5"" between the studs, and they are about 3.5"" deep. There is no real limit on height except that some bolts for the meter pipe extend into the wall about 6 - 7 inches above where the feeder wires come out of the wall from the meter.</p>

<p>2) Next, should I expect to reuse the breakers, or do I need new ones? If new ones, can you suggest what I need?</p>

<p>3) Regarding the fat black wires running from the breaker at the upper left down to between breakers below -- would I be duplicating that, or is that done differently in today's panels?</p>

<p>4) I'll need to know how to shut off the power to the panel box. If I understand correctly that would be done at the meter. And since the meter is locked by the power company, I believe that would mean calling them and asking them to turn it off, then asking them to come out and turn it back on when I'm done. Is that correct?</p>

<p>5) Are there any other components, or any special tools, I'll need?</p>

<p>Thanks! Pictures below:  </p>

",161416,04-04-2019 21:26,What options do I have to replace a failed service panel?,"<p>What are my options to replace an old service panel?   We had a terminal get burned up in our old 1960s GE (TRX2012S if it matters, it's a split-bus/rule-of-six panel). </p>

<p>The tech who looked at it said the part is no longer available, but that if I could find another old service panel just like it, he could swap in the part. Otherwise, it's going to be $2,000+ to replace it with a modern service panel, which also requires getting up to modern code, which involves a lot of other stuff. </p>

<p>EBay and Google isn't showing any direct replacements (or the flush-mount TRX2012F).  </p>

<p>What other options would there be to replace the panel internals?  Are the screw mounting holes compatible with modern GE panel internals? Is the main breaker separable and could that be changed alone?  </p>

<p>Enclosure dimensions are about 20.5"" x 12"". Front panel dimensions are about 22.25"" x 14"".</p>

<p>UPDATE:  </p>

<p>I'm looking at information on replacing the breaker box myself. As the homeowner I wouldn't be required to update anything else to get up to code. Does this sound like a good idea? I've done minor electrical DYI work but nothing this involved.</p>

What sort of dust is this?,"<p>I'm trying to identify the sort of dust shown below.<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/we18F.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/we18F.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
Several days after wiping a surface in my older apartment it shows up. It looks like synthetic fiber, yet there is no vent or isolation material that I can see, nor is there a carpet, bedding, or clothes in that room. No pet either.
Any idea?</p>

<p>As indicated in the comments I did ask a related question regarding the origin of the dust. The answers didn't solve the problem so I'm now asking about the nature of the dust, which isn't quite the same thing. Some folks may recognize it for what it is without wondering where it came from.</p>

<p><em>Answer: It's fiberglass, see <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/160127/apartment-dust-mystery/163884#163884"">Apartment dust mystery</a>.</em></p>

<p>I cleaned thoroughly, including the baseboard radiator (which, as a test, I covered with cloth to ascertain it's not the cause), behind the range and the fridge (there is a small open kitchen corner). Yet, here's what a surface looks like 3 days after wiping it clean:</p>

How can I tell if it is safe to clip these wires?,"<p>We recently bought a little old house with a detached garage that had been converted into a study or studio. There's a great sagging bundle of cables running from the main house to the studio. Some are obviously phone lines, some look like coax cable. None are obviously power lines, but there's definitely electricity in the studio. </p>

<p>We don't have a landline and when we set up our cable they ran a new cable line, and I assume that if we ever wanted a landline they'd start that from scratch, too. So I'd really like to cut these cables, but I obviously don't want to go out with my wire cutter and snip the power line. </p>

<p>Where the power lines come into the main junction box from the street they run through porcelain insulators. I haven't figured out where the power for the studio actually runs. </p>

<p>I've tried to trace them to their respective sources, but at various points they've been painted over and it is really hard to sort out where each wire is coming from or going to.  </p>

<p>So my question is: how do I ensure that I won't electrocute myself before I cut any particular wire? </p>

It had 0 answers at the time.  My best efforts to search for it yielded nothing. So I am re-summarizing the question here, and posting my answer.</em></p>

<p>I am in the Philippines, and I am getting shocked by my shower with electric hot water heater.   The Philippine codes are very similar to American NEC.  We are getting new 240V service installed. </p>

<p>While we wait, we are using the old service that was present.  This provides 220V/240V between only two wires, and does not provide a neutral.  I installed a new 8' grounding rod, and measured from the grounding rod to each wire, and got 120V.</p>

<p>The shower is a Panasonic DH-3JL2P.  It wants hot, neutral and ground.  It is giving me quite a strong shock.  Why is it doing this?  </p>
",109540,02-03-2017 00:44,Why am I getting shocked by a water heater?,"<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>I live in Metro Manila, Philippines where the electric distribution company, Meralco, delivers split-phase power to residential buildings. Our old (1980s) Meralco service drop consists only of 2 conductors, both phase conductors, and <em>no</em> neutral conductor. Phase-to-phase voltage is 240V, while phase-to-ground (measured with the help of an existing ground rod) is 120V.</p>

<p>We recently started the construction of a new house and wired it according to the Philippine Electrical Code (PEC). Based on my research, the PEC is very similar to the NEC. That said, the new house uses three-prong receptacles: 2 for the phases and one for ground. The grounding conductor is connected to a ground rod.</p>

<p>Since Meralco still hasn't energized the new house, it is temporarily connected to the old two-wire service drop, leaving the grounding conductor connected to the ground rod only (i.e. no connection to the load-side neutral yet).</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>

<p>The heater in question is a Panasonic Shower Heater DH-3JL2P (rated at 3.5 kW). Its terminals are labeled Line (L), Neutral (N), and Ground (G). When I tested this heater initially, I had no idea that Meralco's supply is split-phase, not single phase. So I just operated it under the assumption that the line and neutral conductors are connected correctly at the receptacle (which actually doesn't matter now knowing that the supply is split-phase, i.e. both are line conductors, there's no neutral conductor).</p>

<p>Upon testing, the heater functioned properly as far as heating the water is concerned. However, I felt a significant electric shock when I touched the shower head where the heated water was coming from.</p>

<p>What could cause this shock to happen? I have a couple of ideas on why this happened, but can't really say for sure:</p>

<ol>
<li>Grounding conductor is disconnected to the load-size neutral (of the transformer).</li>
<li>Heater is expecting a single-phase supply, not split-phase.</li>
</ol>

<p>I can post a picture of the heater internals later.</p>

Why the Neutral wire is hot,"<p>One of the outlet has no power in my house. I found the neutral wire is also hot like the black wire. There are only two wires, no ground wire involved. The wiring in the house is very new (~ 1 year). What would be the problem?</p>
",137246,12-04-2018 10:13,Getting shocked by a neutral wire,"<p>I'm trying to figure out how I got a shock from a neutral wire. I didn't think it was possible until I read <a href=""http://www.mikeholt.com/safety.php?id=unformatted/shockneutral&amp;type=u&amp;title=Electrocution%20from%20Neutral%20Wire%20%285-19-2K%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">this article</a> on being ""in series with the neutral."" Here's what happened:</p>

<p>I was disconnecting a ceiling fan remote receiver which has a hot and neutral connection and supplies power to the fan and light kit. The hot wire that supplies the box runs through a single-pole switch, so I shut off the switch and tested with a solenoid voltage meter to make sure it was in the off position. I then removed the wire nuts from the hot and neutral connections. I tested both the hot and neutral bundles with the voltage meter (between wires and the grounded box) and there was no voltage, but there was a small spark when I touched the lead to the neutral bundle. I tested it again and there was no voltage, so I assumed that it was static discharge (I don't know why I did that). So I tested the neutral bundle again, to be safe, and there was no voltage. I started unbraiding the neutral wires and that's when I got a shock.</p>

<p>I couldn't believe it. I got a multimeter out and tested again, but there was zero voltage from the neutrals to ground. I turned the switch back on and tested again (hot to ground and hot to neutral), and the black wire was indeed the hot. Then I realized that there were two neutral wires coming into the box, which seemed odd for a ceiling box with only one load (the fan controller). I tested both neutral wires with the switch on and off (neutral to ground): no voltage on either.</p>

<p>Is it possible to get a shock even though you can't detect voltage from a neutral wire? I think now that ""neutral one"" came from a mystery load that ran into the box and hooked up to  ""neutral two"", which runs to the neutral bar. I probably should have tested hot to each neutral separately to confirm this, but I didn't want another shock. Did I complete a circuit when I touched both neutral wires, and that is why I got the shock?</p>

How do I get these faucet handles off,"<p>I've got this same dang faucet, and it is leaky. There are some answers in the linked page, but there are some contradictory posts, so I thought I'd re-pose this query.</p>

Home Electric Panel Questions,"<p>I’m having a pool put in and the pool guys said they need a 20 amp breaker for the pool equipment. My outside panel says 100 amps (see picture). But my panel inside adds up well over 100 amps. Is this normal?  The breakers never trip even with the dryer, AC, and other appliances running. </p>

",137640,20-04-2018 02:11,Do the breaker amp readings sum up to dictate my current panels total / possible amperage?,"<p>So I know practically nothing about houses having rented for many years, just bought a house and was told by my inspector the panel is only a 70 amp panel and will need to be upgraded before I go to install AC.</p>

<p>I took him at his word, and had one AC consult, mentioning this to the guy he looked at my panel and agreed it needed an upgrade.</p>

<p>He gave a terrible quote ($5500 for a 3 ton goodman AC install without the electrical work, no ducting work necessary), so I got somebody else to give me a quote.</p>

<p>Now here's the problem: Fellow comes over and says I have a 150 amp panel and there's room (which I can see) for a couple more breakers on it, and gives me a considerably better AC quote (3500 for a lennox 3 ton 14 seer, all the same bells and whistles).</p>

<p>So now I'm thinking, considering how terrible the quote was from the first consult, perhaps he was just trying to squeeze even more money out of me? Why did my inspector tell me it was a 70 amp panel?</p>

<p>I look at the panel and there's like 6 or 8 15/20 amp breakers on it as well as a 30 amp double-breaker thingy (not sure if this is 30 per or 30 total) and a 50 amp double-breaker thingy.</p>

<p>I'll get a picture when I get home to post here, but off hand my question is:</p>

<p><strong>Is it accurate to say I definitely have over a 70 amp panel due to the sum of amps on breakers in there right now? Is the sum of those little labels on the breakers make up my panels current amperage?</strong></p>

<p>I look online for 70 amp panel and it's this tiny dinky thing with 3 breakers on it..</p>

<p>Edit:
Here are the pictures, if this is not a 70 amp can anybody identify the amps?</p>

<p>Appearances to me are the diagram on the box does not match the actual panel, as the panel has 20 breaker spots (as I read it) while the diagram shows 14. And yes, I realize it's missing a main breaker, so I included the other two pieces I understand identify the max amp load; the conduit and the meter.</p>

How can I ensure an angle valve points in the direction I want it to?,"<p>This may sound silly but after a few home improvement projects involving minor plumbing tasks (like changing faucets) this has always bothered me.</p>

<p>I'm going to talk about the specific example of an angle valve since it's the one I've faced more often, but this could apply to any kind of plumbing accessory that you twist on until its tight.</p>

<p>I've included an image below of the kind of thing I'm talking about in case the translation I googled is off.</p>

<p>In Europe at least, usually you have a shut-off valve like the one in the picture on every water point in the house. In my case, in the house I moved in, I had some very crappy ones with plastic handles that broke with time and didn't serve their purpose anymore (you couldn't use them to shut the water without using pliers)</p>

<p>When installing the replacement it bothered me that I could not get it tight and pointing to the direction more convenient to then connect it to the appliance/faucet.</p>

<p>Logic seems to dictate that it's however the ridges/groves align between the female point on the wall and the valve's male connection but it's weird for an amateur to see that such a detail would be left to luck or expecting that the female point on the wall was mounted with any intention regarding ridges or what will connect to it.</p>

<p>When I faced this, first I tried starting to twist at different points but found that they only engage at very specific points which makes sense and shows the same result (or same 2 results in some cases) no matter where you start. Then I thought just to tighten it to the maximum then go back enough until it's in the position I want it to be, but even when properly using Teflon tape around the grooves I've found that it needs to be absolutely tight to not have any sort of leaks.</p>

<p>Is there any trick to it?</p>

I have the option of doing solid concrete walls for the window well, or cement blocks (which he said he will fill with cement anyways). The concrete walls are significantly more expensive (about 1k more) so I am thinking of just going with concrete blocks, but are there significant reasons why I should choose the concrete walls instead and suck up the extra cost? </p>

<p>Also, do people typically put some type of drainage system in the bottom of the egress window well (sump pump or otherwise)? Is it necessary?</p>

Attaching cable to attic rafters,"<p>I am running approx 40' of cable thru the unfinished attic in order to install two additional receptacles in the kitchen.  The easiest and least obtrusive way for me to do this is to attach 1x3 or 2x4 lumber to face of the rafters to serve as a raceway, then staple the cable every 4 feet or so onto the surface of this raceway.  The wood strips will be attached to the rafters approx. 4' up from where the rafter tails meet the floor. At the end of the run, the cable will drop into the kitchen wall.</p>

<p>Does this installation meet current NEC code, or is there something else I need to do to make this meet code?  Tks.</p>

14/2 line with 12/2 outlet?,"<p>I'm doing some remodeling on a river cabin. It was built 50 years ago and most of it is not to code.</p>

<p>It's not mine and I'm trying to get my family to look at upgrading all the wiring. It doesn't even have outlets with grounds in them.</p>

<p>Also, for those who might be concerned, I do have some experience wiring. My uncle wired his whole home and came down to wire my dad's shop. He taught me and an inspector said it was wired better than some homes he'd been in. I know how to safely wire this project in, just not issue like this. If I can't find a satisfactory answer or I don't feel confident, I will call in a professional. </p>

<p>My issue is that I'm working on redoing a wall in the bathroom. There is currently a light fixture with a built in plug for plugging in something like a hair dryer. I'm replacing that light fixture and would like to add a gfci outlet in the wall before I add the FRP board I'm covering it with. The current gang box for the light is free floating and I'm going to replace it with a plastic one with the little wings that hold it in place. Being able to push it back I can read that the wire says 14/2.</p>

<p>Ideally all the wire would be 12/2, but I don't know when or if that will happen. I'll never use 14/2, so instead of buying a roll of that, can I use a piece of the 12/2 romex that I already have, and wire off the light to the outlet?</p>

<p>I understand that the outlet would only work when the light was on. I just want to make sure I'm not going to burn the cabin down. In my mind, it would be fine, because it's already wired correctly for 14/2, with the correct amp breaker, so if it hits a load too high for the 14/2, then the breaker shuts off. It just has the capability to run more power. I wouldn't be able to do the reverse, but this seems okay.</p>

<p>Am I correct on this or is there an issue I don't know about? Thanks. I did see similar questions, but none that I thought were exactly this issue.</p>

How do I tell this bird to nest elsewhere?,"<p>I seem to be dealing with a tenacious and stupid bird—tenacious for twice rebuilding its nest, and stupid because that location is inherently unstable for a nest, or so I think. From the movement of a suspected bird hovering on a nearby tree, I believe the bird in question is an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_robin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">American Robin</a>.</p>

<p>As much as I like the idea of a bird finding refuge near my house, and as much as I liked to offer space all the way until the hatching season is long over for a nest over the outdoor (but unused) speakers in my backyard, I know from experience that some birds can be pests. Pigeons are territorial, are very dirty, and are impossible to shoo off once they establish their territory.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7OUdn.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7OUdn.jpg"" alt=""undesirable robin nest""></a></p>

<p>The first time I saw it I pushed the nest away and put the strands in the leaf container nearby. (An open bag of tree leaves only acts as an invitation to birds and more). The bird returned immediately and asserted its space by building another nest. I tried again, ever so gently, to point out that this is really not the right place 1- because the residents really do not want to be attacked every time they step out of their front door (the bird could consider their passage trespassing so close to the bird's sanctuary), and 2- the bar holding the lamp in place is much too thin to act as adequate support for a nest.</p>

<p>Hence the second time I both pulled the nest down and added a plastic bag on top of the lamp to make it harder to access that spot, and more slippery to build on top. As you see in the picture, the bird dropped the bag down and rebuilt.</p>

<p>How do I tell this bird to nest elsewhere?</p>

<p>I may have an even more serious problem from the wasp nest you see in the picture. I believe it is uninhabited, or at least no longer inhabited. (In a previous incident I've seen that they make their presence known, if they're inside.) But I'll handle these nature elements one at a time. They're too strong for me.</p>

<p>This is the second such nest I have on two edges of the same outside wall on adjacent years. I'm either inattentive, or they are particularly fast: the nest is built before I notice. One idea that worked with the first one was to spray shaving foam over it. Luckily the foam stayed there long enough, and the entrance was no longer menacing. The second one, pictured, seems to have served its function and is now empty.</p>

<p>The wikipedia page linked above suggests they might reuse a previous nest, and so I'll pull this off soon to avoid a recurrence.</p>

<p>Apparently they find something particularly attractive at this location. The color of the bricks? That the spot is shielded from rain? Is there a way to dissuade them from building in this particular spot?</p>

<p>I have also had yet another wasp nest below a layer of leaves in a bag near this entrance. Is this the same species? Might the presence of leaves act as an incentive to build the ""organ pipe"" mud dauber?</p>

The ground is cut short and not grounded.</p>

<p>Now on to the outlet: the wire from the switch is connected to the top screw - but it's on the side that says ""white"". </p>

<p>There are two more sets of wires that connect to the outlet as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>the two black ones are on the the other screw terminal on the bottom (one on the ""white"" side) </li>
<li>the grounds are grounded to the screw terminal below that </li>
<li>the white ones are connected by the one from the switch to the bottom (black side), with one of the white ones from the other set on the screw terminal, and the one from the other cable is on the top screw terminal on the ""white"" side.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now to the light: there are the black and white that come out of the box, and that is the set that has the ground cut short.</p>

<p>The original light fixture was a single 660w/250v rated socket.  The one my friend put up was a fixture with two 660w /250v sockets.  At the light only black and white connected, not ground... It worked then made noise and this is where I'm at.</p>

Using existing wiring to run new wire,"<p>Fist off - I am not going to do this job myself, I would just like to try to do this without cutting open the ceiling.
We have a 110 GFCI outlet in our garage and I would like to add a 30 amp plug that would come from it's own breaker for our Airstream trailer when I'm working on it in the driveway.
The distance from breaker box to the garage wall is about 20 feet.
What is the possibility of tying on the new wiring to the existing wiring, pulling it back to the breaker using the existing wiring, and then pulling it all back to the garage together?
Is this an unreasonable request to ask the electrician?</p>
",123797,22-09-2017 05:35,(How) Can I use existing stapled electrical wire to fish new wire?,"<p>I nicked an electrical cable while doing a plumbing repair and so need to fix it. I previously <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/112676/how-can-i-repair-a-nicked-wire-without-adding-a-junction-box"">asked</a> about repairing the damage in place, but there are receptacles 6-10 feet away on either side of the damaged wire, so it may not be too difficult to just pull new wire. Most of the wire is run horizontally through the studs, which is great, but it will at least be stapled at both boxes (and possibly more). The horizontal run is ~18"" up from the floor, while the receptacles are ~6"". There is also an inside corner the wire is run through. Wire is 12/2.</p>

<p>Is it possible to use the existing wire to fish the new wire, even though the existing wire is stapled? Would I need to open up the wall to remove the staples?</p>

This 100amp sub feeds a kitchen (fridge, microwave, dishwasher, gas range), a bathroom, 3 bedrooms, and a living room.

Dedicated 240v 30A Circuit Switched for A/C and NEMA 14-30,"<p>I have a dedicated 240 volt circuit that's hard wired into my air conditioning unit.  The circuit has a 30 amp breaker at the main box and another 30 amp breaker on the wall next to my air conditioner.  Since the main breaker box is on the opposite side of the house from the garage, another run would be price preclusive.  Instead, I am considering the install of a switch (e.g. DPDT Center-Off) like the Leviton 1288:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.leviton.com/en/docs/PK-93107-10-02-0D-W.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.leviton.com/en/docs/PK-93107-10-02-0D-W.pdf</a>
(see figure 3)</p>

<p>The goal is to keep the circuit dedicated - regardless of which load it is directed to (i.e. air conditioner <strong>OR</strong> NEMA 14-30).  The NEMA 14-30 would be used in the garage for charging an electric vehicle.  The air conditioning unit is outside (just on the other side of the wall).</p>

<p>Two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does this use case violate NEC code?</li>
<li>Is DPDT a reasonable choice for this use case?</li>
</ol>

<p>Another answer in the forum (slightly different question) stated that it is 'more elegant' to switch the Neutral wire (since it too is a conductor).  I have not been able to locate a wiring diagram depicting Neutral with a DPDT.  What's the scoop?</p>
",167450,18-06-2019 04:49,I need to switch between two 240V 30A loads,"<p>I've got a situation where I have a 240V 30A dryer line, and I want to power something else from the same circuit, but NEVER at the same time as the dryer. I'm looking for a switch to use, like a DPDT ON-ON break-before-make switch. There are tons of DPDT switches I've found, and most seem to be ON-OFF. Hardly any show their wiring diagrams, so if they don't give more details, I don't know if they'll work. Note: the second circuit will not use more than 15A, maybe just 12A.</p>

<p>I'm hoping someone can recommend specific switches that will do what I want. Manufacturer and exact part# is what I'm looking for. </p>

<p>Personally, I don't care if it's a knife switch, something that looks like a standard light switch, two buttons, has relays, I don't care. The breaker box is full, it's a long and difficult wire run, and I do not need a separate circuit because I'll NEVER need to run both devices at once.</p>

<p>I could resort to just using one plug and unplugging one then plugging the other one in, but I don't see the point of constantly exposing live wires (the plugs) where something could inadvertently fall on them or water could be sprayed, instead of keeping things all sealed in the wall with a safe, simple switch between two plugs.</p>

31 volts on wall outlet circuit,"<p>I have a circuit on a 15 amp breaker. It was working fine yesterday and then suddenly everything stopped working. The breaker was not tripped. My non contact voltage detector goes crazy as soon as it gets near any of the outlets. Using a digital multimeter the outlets show 31 volts with the breaker on and 0 volts with the breaker off. At the breaker in the panel there is 120 breaker to neutral bus. Removed a couple of outlets and hot to neutral shows 31 volts(with breaker on, 0 with breaker off) 2 wire ungrounded circuit (house built in the 60s). There are two lights that are on this same circuit and they work just fine. I disconnected the lights from the circuit and still only 50 volts on the outlets. I continued to disassemble all of the outlets on the circuit with the same result, 50 volts hit to neutral. I believe the outlets are pig tailed out of the wall as each outlet( so far) only has one set of wires to it. This is not in a kitchen/bathroom and has no gfci on it.
This is not the same as having induced/phantom voltage. The circuit only shows the 31 volts with the power on to it at the breaker. If it were induced, it would show this when the breaker was off. However when the breaker is off it shows 0 voltage.</p>

<p>UPDATE: after disassembling all of the outlets, I still had the same problem. I found the main feed line and was getting 118 to it at the wall outlet it went to. The rest of the outlets on the circuit are fed from this point. I made a jumper using 12/3 from the feed to the last outlet on the circuit. Using wire buts to connect everything I then have 118.2 volts on the entire circuit, except the point where the circuit is fed from, 108 volts there. I believe I have a bad connection in the wall. This houses junction boxes are not easily accessible and have been hidden over the years. Proceeding to open the wall a bit and see what I can find. </p>

<p>I appreciate all of the input and help.</p>

Window air conditioner exhaust temperature,"<p>I'm planning to put a window air conditioner in an apartment awning window.

I have since discovered that I can't remove the part of the window that swings out or alter it so that it swings out farther. Has anyone found a solution to this, besides using a portable air conditioner, which I don't want to do?</p>

<p>I have thought of building a wooden enclosure for the air conditioner connected to and sealed with the window opening. In other words, a window extension. I would be concerned about a possible fire hazard because of the air (hot?) exhaust and if the exhaust would affect the material that the window is made of.</p>

Vapor barrier behind durock?,"<p>I am redoing a shower, tearing off old tile, replacing green board with Durock.  I need help on whether I should or should not put a plastic sheet, vapor barrier over the studs before putting in the Durock.  I am in a second floor condo and I don't want any water getting behind the shower walls and dripping down into the lower unit.
   I have read some other posts on this topic.  Some feel the Durock should ""breathe"" to dispense any moisture to prevent mildew for forget the plastic sheet. My worry is if my unit causes damage below- I have to pay to fix it.  I want things waterproof.
   I read another post suggesting a 12"" strip of plastic along the top of the tub area with the plastic overlapping the lip of the tub and sealed against it.  That ought to be water proof and leave the Durock above the strip free to breathe.

Solar system with both grid tie-in and backup power without battery?,"<p>My wife and I have been talking for a few years now about getting some solar panels installed on our roof.  We even went so far as to have a sales rep for an installer come out and talk through our options.  He told us that we could:</p>

<ol>
<li>Have a system that ties into the grid and sells electricity back
to the power company.  This sounds like a great idea, and seems
cost-effective as well.</li>
<li>Have batteries that store surplus power to provide our home with backup power in case of a blackout.  Again this sounds like a great idea, but it also sounds like the cost
would be prohibitively expensive for us.</li>
<li>Have a battery-less system that provides power to our house when the power goes out, but
only when the sun is shining.</li>
</ol>

<p>.... but that we could <strong>not</strong> have both (1) and (3) without (2).  He insisted that if we are connected to the grid, there is no way to switch our system to directly powering our house in the event of a blackout; if we wanted to be connected to the grid <em>and</em> have emergency power, a battery backup system is the only way.</p>

<p>This makes no sense to me, and he was unable to explain why (other than ""it's just a different kind of system"").  I suspect he was just trying to upsell me to a battery backup system. But since I don't really understand the technology I thought I would ask here.  Can someone explain to me what, if anything, are the issues here?  Please be gentle, as this stuff is well beyond my zone of competence.</p>
",195084,12-06-2020 18:45,"using solar when power grid down, why do I need batteries?","<p>I am considering a home solar photovoltaic installation, probably 5kw or so.   The usual configuration around here is with a grid-connected inverter and net metering.  But when the grid goes down, the inverter shuts off (to avoid back-feeding into the power grid and electrocuting linemen).</p>

<p>We are interested in being able to use the solar when the power goes down (not infrequent in this rural area).   According to the solar installer, the only way it is possible to do this is to also install a battery system like Tesla PowerWall.   The idea is that when the inverter loses the 60Hz sinewave from the grid it shuts off; the inverter in the PowerWall supplies this sinewave, so the inverter doesn't shut off, and there's also a mechanism to disconnect from the grid.  </p>

<p>That sounds reasonable.   But the cost is not.  Two PowerWalls would roughy double the cost of the installation.  During outages, we would be satisfied to only have power when the sun shines; this would keep food safe, allow us to draw water, etc.  Electrically, there is no reason this can't be done without the expensive battery system.  All that is necessary is to generate the 60Hz reference for the solar system's inverter, and to disconnect from the grid.  Has anyone been able to manage such an installation ?   Would it be strictly DIY (perhaps feasible as I'm a EE) ?</p>

Breakers loose in panel a problem?,"<p>So I had an old panel and subpanel replaced with a single new panel. The guys reused the old breakers, and the breakers wobble in the panel like loose teeth. With the old panel, they didn't wobble at all. </p>

Use of 20 Amp Breaker and 12/2 Cable for Circuit Containing 15 Amp Duplex Receptacles,"<p>What is the rationale behind using a 20 amp circuit breaker with 12/2 cable for a circuit that only contains 15 amp duplex receptacles? I understand the rationale behind using 12/2 cable instead of 14/2 cable, but do not understand the rationale behind using the 20 amp circuit breaker instead of a 15 amp circuit breaker. Without understanding the rationale, I would assume it would be prudent to either:</p>

<ol>
<li>Replace the 20 amp circuit breaker with a 15 amp circuit breaker.</li>
<li>Replace the 15 amp duplex receptacles with 20 amp duplex receptacles.</li>
</ol>

<p>References to the National Electric Code would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p><strong>Are 15A 3-prong grounded outlets actually rated to 20A, allowing them to be used on 20A circuits? And if so, why, when the outlet can never be asked to supply more than 15A by anything that would be plugged into it?</strong></p>

<p>More info:</p>

<p><a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/11803/would-there-be-a-problem-installing-20a-switches-on-a-15a-circuit"">This question</a> had a comment that 15A outlets were actually rated to 20A. However, by design, there is nothing that will plug into a 15A outlet that will draw more than 15A. An appliance that draws more than 15 amps would have a ""T-blade"" plug that wouldn't go into a standard 15A outlet. </p>

<p>In addition, outlets are always wired in parallel, meaning that a 15A outlet would never have to transmit the amperage draw of a ""downstream"" outlet; you never ""daisy-chain"" outlets by connecting hot to neutral, for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>So, there is AFAIK no situation in which a 15A receptacle would ever have to handle more than 15A, even if installed on a 12AWG, 20A-breaker circuit.</p>

<p>If all the above is true, why would a 15A receptacle even have to be rated to 20A?</p>

This is the first time I've had any water come out of the TPR when I wasn't testing it.</p>

<p>I moved into this house in 2011.  In 2012 I installed a water expansion tank, with a ball valve to disconnect the hot water system—the expansion tank plus water heater.  I realize the water expansion tank is probably near the end of its life.  The water heater is electric and over 20 years old (I know), but I've been flushing it thoroughly once a year and replacing sacrificial anodes as needed, and it hasn't leaked yet.</p>

<p>The only recent change to the system is that I used to have a pressure gauge connected to a hot water faucet instead of the normal connection to my washing machine, and I finally removed the gauge and reconnected the hot water hose for the washing machine.  When the washing machine runs, I can hear a knock in the pipes when the washer hot water valve turns on or off (which was why I installed an expansion tank in the first place).  Note that there is a PRV on the water main.</p>

<p>To test things, I opened the TRP valve and closed it against.  It took its good old time closing and kept leaking for a while.  So I opened and closed it again, and that time it closed more quickly and stopped leaking.  I had seen this once before in testing, so I didn't read anything into it.</p>

<p>Then I closed the ball valve to remove external pressure from the hot water system, I opened all of the hot water faucets above it, and I checked the air pressure inside my expansion tank.  It's down around 28 PSI from the 60 PSI that it's supposed to be at, so I'll have to address that.  But when I opened the ball valve again and individually closed each faucet, the TPR valve spit out a bit of water again when I closed the last valve.</p>

<p>Am I correct in my assumption that the TPR valve is failing?  Is it normal for them to fail gradually instead of opening catastrophically?  Would the underpressured expansion tank have any bearing on this? </p>

"First time testing old motion sensor outdoor light, with new LED bulbs, light flickers at constant fast hz, why?","<p>What could cause a motion sensor to blink at a steady frequency when it is turned on?</p>

<p>We've had an outdoor motions sensor flood light that hasn't worked, we presume because the bulbs died. After much delay and various electrical works on our house, we finally took the existing bulbs out, got replacements, and installed both of them. Testing it out now, we find the light flickering at a constant, relatively fast frequency! Before changing the bulbs it did not turn on at all. When switching it off, it turns off, and when switching it on it begins flickering almost every time we've tested it. The flickering is very steady and rapid, which makes me think it is not a loose wire anywhere but rather some more 'stable' or steady problem.</p>

<p>I've tested the different settings on the motion sensor and they didn't change or stop the flickering in any orderly way, though the flickering did in one case not start until it saw motion, and in another seemingly random case the flickering was slower and then got faster.</p>

<p>We've had electrical work done on the house, including on the circuit we think this light was on. We were never 100% sure which circuit the light was on because when testing circuits we presumed the bulbs were just dead and they're high up so we hadn't replaced them, but based on location of the light and other wiring we know of, we're pretty confident which it's on. So far there's no other signs of electrical issues in the house.</p>

<p>Here's a photo of the back label of the motion sensor light:

These seem to work as you'd expect with regular incandescent bulbs- you can set a timer for how long you want them to be on when motion is detected and they light up fine.</p>

<p>When replacing them with LED bulbs however they blink rapidly instead of staying on. I'm not talking about a 50hz buzz or whatever, they completely power off and on rapidly, almost like they are trying to strobe. The blinking is erratic, it will go for 10 seconds then go dark completely, then blink again for varying amounts of time. I see this same behavior with LED bulbs in both of the sockets, which are the same brand and model of motion detector outdoor light sockets. </p>

What is the right way to join aluminum house wiring to aluminum fixture wiring?,"<p>My home is 1970s construction with aluminum wiring. I have recently upgraded several fixtures in my bathroom and basement. These fixtures have all been internally wired with stranded aluminum wiring. The directions for these fixtures make no mention of special care needed for joining aluminum to copper. About half of the fixtures have shipped with some sort of crimp connector to join to the house wiring, the remainder have shipped with bog standard wire nuts. These fixtures are all LED lights. I expect them to be fairly low draw.</p>

It's worse in the summer (I live in central TX), but I've had the air conditioner inspected, and while the house is right at the maximum capacity for our unit, the unit should still be able to take care of the load. That also doesn't explain why our winter bills are larger than the comparables.</p>

How to build watertight containers that keep water out even if it is fully submerged?,"<p>Examples of appliances I want to protect are: monitors, computers, and printers.</p>
<p>I have looked everywhere and I cannot find a solution where I can simply buy a box in the market. These are often times very small and will not fit the appliances I need to be protected.</p>
<p>Assumption is that the container will be used for home use in case there is a great flood. So the water pressure isn't likely to be too strong--not like submarines where they dive down to deep altitudes.</p>
<p>I can say that a submarine is a massive watertight container that can allow many people and equipment to live inside it. So, creating a watertight container should be possible with similar concepts. I wonder what materials and techniques I should look into to build one myself.</p>

There was only one time in 26 years where our home was devastated by the flood reaching up to half of the 2nd floor. This destroyed so much of our things such as our car, electronics, furniture, documents, and etc. Other than that, there are a few instances of flooding that reaches only a few inches into the home but it was also rare.</p>
<p>I am considering buying quite an expensive monitor, CPU, and printer but I am thinking that rainy season just arrived and I am afraid they will just get destroyed. The only way I can be reassured I can buy these if I can find some kind of storage solution that if I place my appliances/electronics in them, there is an almost 100% certainty that water will not be able to enter and damage the objects in case it gets submerged (assume the entire thing is submerged for hours to days).</p>
<p>I have looked for flood bags, but all I can see everywhere are either sandbags or sandbag-like fibres that absorb water and create a barrier to prevent water from entering, but these are surely only for mild flooding. If it is on the scale where it will reach the items of value,  it will be a massive flood thus a watertight storage solution is the answer.</p>
<p>I have been looking but I cannot seem to find any good solution. I am thinking of something like a garbage bag, but I know garbage bags are not the best choice as they are not watertight despite having several layers of them</p>

Only My Circuit Tester Trips GFCI,"<p>I installed several GFCI’s throughout the house to bring things up to code.    After installation I tested each one per the instructions and indications are they’re all working properly.  I then decided to use my Commercial Electric brand plug-in circuit tester as a final check and all but one GFCI tested as it should.  The one at the kitchen counter, however, trips as soon as the tester is plugged in, but it doesn’t trip when appliances are plugged in, they all work properly.  That particular GFCI loads two (2) other outlets downstream so I disconnected them and ran the test at the GFCI by itself and sure enough, it tripped again.  I can plug things into the outlet and they all work fine but plugging the tester in trips it every time.  It seems strange that the tester works in all other outlets throughout the house but that one.  I even switched GFCI’s thinking maybe it’s a faulty unit but the same thing happens with either GFCI.   I verified that the incoming power source (white-black-ground) are properly connected to the LINE terminals on the GFCI.</p>

Try to determine who makes it and then if I can remove ONLY the adjustable wood sill filler since it is frozen and the screws are stripped. I would buy a new threshold and my hopes are to take it apart and just replace the adjustable sill.</p>
<p>Do not know who makes this. Wrote a few people with no luck.

Why does my refrigerator trip the GFCI outlet?,"<p>I've been reading around the net for about 20 minutes and came across a lot of talk about how the fridge should be on their own 15 or 20 Amp breaker and the defrost cycle can cause the interrupt in a GFCI causing it to flip</p>

<p>I have a 20 Amp GFCI receptacle on a 20A Breaker that also feeds 4 other 15A receptacles that have a load on the fridge, the oven and 3 other receptacles along the kitchen counter, My old fridge (one big door, freezer door on top) had no problems on the GFCI frosted good, made ice, defrosted, everything was fine, I got a new side by side fridge and every 24 hours or so the breaker is flipped. </p>

<p>If it didn't happen with my old one, why would it happen with my new one, I changed the GFCI thinking it was the loose wires or just an old receptacle, Nope. next day it flipped, so i tested and confirmed all of the others outlets were fine, no loss, no interruptions </p>
",147360,21-09-2018 03:03,Why would a GFCI trip on refrigerator circuit?,"<p>My refrigerator is tripping the GFCI on the socket into which it is plugged.  Searching about this topic seems to indicate that this is a reasonably common complaint.  However, I can't find any concrete information about general causes or potential solutions other than suggestions to replace everything and hope for the best; this seems unsatisfying.</p>

<p>This is a new fridge and all new electrical work by licensed professionals.  I believe that the electrical is installed correctly and grounded, and that there is no damage to the fridge. I believe this is a dedicated circuit from the breaker panel to the outlet for the fridge. Nothing else is on this circuit and nothing else is plugged into the other socket. Low humidity. Kitchen installation. No water, no ice-maker. This has never happened before, but now it trips the GFCI immediately after reset.</p>

<p>I've done the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reset the GFCI, then re-plugged the fridge; GFCI tripped again.</li>
<li>Plugged other things (alone) into the fridge's GFCI outlet: they work fine and GFCI does not trip.</li>
<li>Plugged refrigerator into other GFCI-protected outlet with nothing else on it; <em>this</em> GFCI outlet also tripped.</li>
<li>Plugged refrigerator into other non-GFCI outlet; works and doesn't trip the breaker.</li>
<li>Tested the socket wiring (using 3-lamp receptacle tester) -- it's correct.</li>
<li>Measured resistance between prongs on the refrigerator's electrical cord; ~300 kOhms between hot and neutral; no continuity to ground from either.  This all seems reasonable.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> per comment below, I should also note that I called the service line for the manufacturer: they said only that, if the appliance works when plugged into a non-GFCI outlet, that there's nothing more they can do.</p>

<p>To me, this seems to suggest the fridge is broken -- but it's brand new!  <strong>Why would my fridge be tripping the GFCI? Is this to be expected for a refrigerator?</strong> Should I just plug it into non-GFCI and ignore it ""like any normal person""? ;-)</p>

<p>Several other questions on this site suggest solutions for other GFCI issues, but I don't see any about refrigerators and GFCI.  <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/a/33227/28171"">This answer</a> seems to suggest that refrigerators shouldn't be on GFCI in the first place.  However, my electrician said it's now code to have refrigerator's on GFCI (at least locally), but <a href=""http://www.esgroundingsolutions.com/blog/720/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">there seems to be disagreement</a> about The Rules.</p>

<p>Other discussions quickly devolve to inaccurate and imprecise citing of NEC, or straying from erudite matters:</p>

<p>I have a 15A GFCI breaker.  Strangely, it is hooked up to the up stairs bathroom AND the outdoor outlets.  Recently it has started to perform poorly.  It either trips easily or doesn't work after reseting the breaker.</p>

<p>I opened up the panel and was surprised to see what looks like two circuits wired into the breaker.  That is, you have a two pairs of black/white (hot &amp; neutral I presume).  The hot lines are going into the breaker together (on the top) and the same with the neutrals (on the bottom).</p>

<p>Is there any valid reason for this? It seems like the installer was lazy and because there isn't much room left on the panel they wired these two circuits into one breaker.</p>

<p>UPDATE: 
This is a Bryant circuit breaker box from the late 80's.  The GFCI breaker was a 15 amp Sylvania which raised a bunch of eye brows when I brought it into the electrical supply place. Now it sounds like everyone makes ""BR"" compatible breakers including Eaton.</p>

<p>I ended up getting an Eaton breaker from Home Depot and only wiring in one pair of wires (the wiring to the outside sockets).  Seems to work fine.  I am going to buy another breaker and put it in one of the open spots in the box.</p>

<p>My guess is that whomever was last in this box didn't want to spring $40 for a second GFCI breaker.  </p>

<p>UPDATE 2:</p>

<p>Thanks for the comments!  Giving that the house was built in 1986 it seems like it was standard to use one GFCI for multiple outlets.  In my case - this certainly caused problems over time and I am replacing with multiple GFCI breakers.</p>

Proper way to run and fish electrical wire in Canada?,"<p>This is my first DIY electrical project, so I am looking for some advise about the proper way to run the following 3 new circuits that I'll need for a basement kitchen that I am building:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BErBM.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BErBM.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I am currently reading the ""Canadian Electrical Code, Part 1"" in preparation for this DIY electrical work, but it creates a lot of questions that I am hoping someone with experience can help me with.</p>

<p>Most of my ceilings in the basement is drop-ceiling, covering exposed joists above. All the existing wiring is stapled to the bottom face of the joists, which according to CEC is not allowed anymore, so I cannot do it that way, correct? I am basing this on <strong>Rule 12-514-b</strong>: </p>

<pre><code>Cables shall not be run on or across the lower faces of basement 
joists, unless suitably protected from mechanical damage.
</code></pre>

<p>So I guess that means that my only option is to drill holes through all the joist and run the cables that way. This creates 2 questions:</p>

<p><strong>Q1)</strong> What do I do when joists have HVAC ducts taking up the space between the joists that I need to cross? I know that cables require a minimum separation of 25mm from heating ducts, so what are my options? What kind of ""mechanical protection"" do I need to use, if I do need to staple to the bottom of the joist?</p>

<p><strong>Q2)</strong> I have one 3-wire circuit and two 2-wire circuits to run. Can they all be run in the same hole? I can't find any info in the code about how many NMD90 wires are allowed in one joist hole...</p>

<p>Next, there's the question of how to run the wire over the part of the ceiling that is not accessible to me. There's a dry-walled, dropped section of the ceiling running along the entire length of the basement, and that I need to cross before I can get from the panel to the side of the house where the drop-ceiling is. What are my options for crossing that space, considering that I cannot support the cable every 1.5m as per <strong>Rule 12-510-1-a</strong>, without completely opening up the ceiling? </p>

<p>I found this rule about fishing wire:</p>

<pre><code>== 12-520 Fished cable installation ==

Where the cable is used in concealed wiring and it is impracticable to 
provide the supports required by Rule 12-510, and where metal sheeting 
or cladding, metal joists, metal top or bottom plates, or metal studs 
are not used, the cable shall be permitted to be fished.
</code></pre>

<p>So my last question is:</p>

<p><strong>Q3)</strong> Did I understand correctly that I can simply fish the wire over the obstruction w/o any sort of conduit? What if that space contains metal HVAC ducts? Do I need to use some sort of conduit then? Is NMD90 wire even allowed to be run through conduits? What are my options?</p>

<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated!</p>
",149814,03-11-2018 02:37,Can I fish Romex cable through concealed part of basement ceiling in Canada?,"<p>I am running two 2-wire and one 3-wire Romex cables from the panel in the basement to another part of the basement. For most of the run I have access to the ceiling joists, but I need to cross a 2.5 meter section which is closed off and contains lots of ducts and pipes.</p>

<p>Here's the obstruction. I am thinking of fishing cable between the joists on the top right of the picture:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zszSB.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zszSB.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/blvw9.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/blvw9.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>This means that I can't support the cable every 1.5 meters, but Rule 12-520 in CEC says:</p>

<pre><code>Where the cable is used in concealed wiring and it is impracticable to 
provide the supports required by Rule 12-510, and where metal sheeting 
or cladding, metal joists, metal top or bottom plates, or metal studs 
are not used, the cable shall be permitted to be fished.
</code></pre>

<p>So I just want to make sure that I understood this correctly. Can I fish the cable through, despite the fact that there are some metal ducts in the space?</p>

<p>My question is, can I connect more than one wire to a breaker and still meet code or do I need to get a new breaker.  Both the wires and plugs are the same rating as the breaker - 15 amp.</p>

<p>Making the assumption that only one wire can be under each screw in the breaker, can I make a junction in the panel box?  IE, one wire to breaker, but two wires to a wire nut connecting them together, or does the junction need to be in a separate box?</p>

Will portable air con cool as well as temperature increases?,"<p>I have a portable air conditioner, it's currently reducing my room from 23-24C to 17-18C. 24C is not exactly hot and the main purpose of the unit is for when it does get hotter.

AFCI breakers - 30mA ground fault detection threshold - nuisance trips?,"<p>I'm trying to understand a bit about nuisance-tripping, and I'm wondering if anyone here has some insight.</p>

<p>I know (or think I know) that a Class A GFCI breaker should trip when there is a 6mA ground current (fault). I've also read that an AFCI breaker will generally trip when there is a 30mA ground current.</p>

<p>So my question is: are nuisance trips more likely on a GFCI due to that lower threshold (6mA), compared to AFCI (30mA)? </p>

<p>I apologize if my terminology isn't correct. I <em>think</em> I know what I'm asking, but... maybe not. </p>

<p>People seem to indicate that you should never use GFCI protection on your refrigerator due to the possibility of nuisance trips. But AFCI protection is required. I'm assuming the AFCI is less likely to nuisance-trip, and maybe this 6mA-to-30mA comparison explains why? The 30mA is low enough to mitigate fire risk, but high enough that most nuisance trips are avoided? (Whereas with a GFCI, the 6mA threshold is low enough to mitigate most risk of shock injury, but makes it more susceptible to nuisance trips?)</p>
",105418,31-12-2016 04:31,Why aren't GFCI and AFCI breakers combined or used together?,"<p>In household circuit breaker panels, you'll find two different types of breakers: Arc Fault and Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters.</p>

<p>Ground Fault (GFCI) breakers are typically used in places where water might come in contact with an outlet/wire, such as bathrooms and garages. They have circuitry to sense when the current out is different from the current in, which usually means the circuit is shorted to ground. This is to prevent electrical shock to humans.</p>

<p>Arc Fault (AFCI) breakers sensors to check for arcing, in order to prevent electrical fires.</p>

<p>(And then there's just regular circuit breakers, which trip if the current drawn through them is over their limit, such as 20 amps.)</p>

<p>Why are these two not combined into a single breaker which trips if it detects either condition? Or, alternately, why not have one of each breaker in series for each circuit, for the same result?</p>

<p>EDIT - Looks like AFCI and GFCI are sometimes combined by using an AFCI breaker combined with a GFCI outlet (the kind with the Test and Reset buttons, often seen in bathrooms). But that still leaves most outlets with only current-limiting protection, why?</p>

Voltage tester detecting voltage in non-hot wires when the light switch is off,"<p>I just switched the wiring of a single-pole light switch from back wiring to side wiring and noticed that my voltage tester (non-contact pen-style one, Klein Tools NCVT-3) detects voltage in both the other black wire going into light fixsture and the ground wire when the switch is off. The tester beeped with one or two yellow lights on, so the voltage seems lower side. </p>

<p>I did continuity testing with my multimeter and the reading looked fine (overload when the switch was off and 0 and beeping when the switch was on).</p>

<p>From my completely novice point of view, the switch should cut off any current when it is off and voltage should be detected in the hot wire only but not in others. Is it not true? Does what I see indicate something's wrong or is it actually normal (like picking up voltage from the nearby hot wire)?</p>
",194104,30-05-2020 23:30,"Electric shock - was I stupid, unlucky, or a combination of both?","<p>One of the double sockets in our garage needed replacing (damaged after a washing pole hit it) - a pretty trivial job that I'd done before. So I flipped the MCB for the ring main, used a non-contact voltage tester to check nothing was there, and set to work. I disconnected the old socket fine, and was lining the cables up to fit into the new socket when... ow.</p>

<p>My finger bridged the live and earth pins, and suffice to say the live wire was <em>very</em> much alive. Bar a few finger spasms I was fine fortunately, and believe me I realise I was very lucky in that respect (I'm in the UK, so that was 240V.) Before finishing the job I then shut off the entire property's electrics - I was taking no more chances.</p>

<p>Further inspection confirmed two things I immediately suspected at this point - the MCB in the garage (installed before we moved into the house) was shutting off power via the neutral, not the live, and the voltage tester was dodgy (I had tested it on the same socket earlier and it seemed fine, further testing showed it presumably had a loose connection internally and only worked sporadically.) <strong>Needless to say it's now in the bin, and an electrician has been called to sort the MCB and check the rest of the house for similar issues.</strong></p>

<p>Unsurprisingly this has shaken me up a bit - I would say I'm a rather safety conscious person, and in this case thought I'd done all the checks properly (including taping over the relevant trip switch to ensure no-one flipped it back on while I was working.) In some ways I can't help feeling I was unlucky that the MCB was wired by a cowboy, in combination with the voltage tester failing in the way that it did, at the time that it did. However, I'm not one to solely blame tools - clearly some, if not most of the blame here lies with myself also.</p>

<p>So in short, what should I have done differently - and was I primarily being stupid, or really quite unlucky?</p>

<p>Many shed designs recommend building the floor with equally spaced joists. This serves two purposes namely making the floor stronger and, since most sheds are built on soil or gravel, provides additional spacing and support between the ground and the plywood floor.</p>

<p>In my case, however, the weight isn't an issue since there won't be any heavy loads inside the cabin (unlike a shed) and the ground level is a concrete slab which provides structural support and some insulation.</p>

<p>My question is whether I can do away with the joists all together and only keep the outer bands? </p>

<p>This would save me time, money and make it easier to install foam board insulation since I won't need to cut it up to fit between the joists. It would also provide better insualtion since each foam board would cover a large area without need to be cut to fit between the joists.</p>

<p>Finally, am I correct in saying that I would put a sheet of poly to create a  vapor barrier between the concrete slab and the foam board insulation on top of which I would put the plywood? Would fixing cut and groove plywood around the edges of the 10 x 12 floor be enough or does anyone have other ideas to fix the ply?</p>

<p>Also is it necessary for me to install the foam board between the joists so that there isn't a gap between the foam and the plywood (which means more work because I may need to cut the foam to size in between the joists) or can I simply lay the foam boards down and put the joists on top (there will be an air gap between the foam and the plywood due to the height of the joists)?</p>

<p>Or a third option would be to insulate above the floor joists and then put the ply on top which would make it unnecessary to cut the foam? This would have the added benefit of having large continuous foam board areas rather than smaller pieces in between the joists.</p>

<p>Many shed designs recommend building the floor with equally spaced joists. This serves two purposes namely making the floor stronger and, since most sheds are built on soil or gravel, provides additional spacing and support between the ground and the plywood floor.</p>

<p>In my case, however, the weight isn't an issue since there won't be any heavy loads inside the cabin (unlike a shed) and the ground level is a concrete slab which provides structural support and some insulation.</p>

<p>My question is whether I can do away with the joists all together and only keep the outer bands?</p>

<p>This would save me time, money and make it easier to install foam board insulation since I won't need to cut it up to fit between the joists. It would also provide better insualtion since each foam board would cover a large area without need to be cut to fit between the joists.</p>

<p>Finally, am I correct in saying that I would put a sheet of poly to create a vapor barrier between the concrete slab and the foam board insulation on top of which I would put the plywood? Would fixing cut and groove plywood around the edges of the 10 x 12 floor be enough or does anyone have other ideas to fix the ply?</p>

New light bulbs light up even when switched off,"<h1>Edit:</h1>

<p>I have confirmed that my main question is answered in another post. But there are still things that bother me.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why is there a buzzing sound when the bulbs work?</p></li>
<li><p>The new bulbs do not light up in another bathroom with the same kind of dimmer switch. Why is that?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I understand these questions are tough nuts to crack without certain details that might be hard to obtain. For example, it might be hard for me to dismantle the existing switches and look under the cover or to know the brand/model of the switch.</p>

<hr>

<p>I just replaced my bathroom light fixture bulbs with newly bought bulbs (LED, A19, 40W equivalents). What I get is a head-scratcher: the bulbs light up dimly as soon as I screw them on and the switch is off. If I push the switch on, the bulbs function normally, but with a noticeable buzzing sound. Looks like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8rx8u.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8rx8u.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I am trying to figure out if there is something wrong with the new bulbs or the circuit. This is the box that the new bulbs came in.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gmFcj.jpg"" width=""400""></p>

<p>My previous bulbs are of the same brand and the same kind (LED) but a higher wattage. My money is on that this has something to do with the switch. Most of my switches have a dimmer and a little LED that helps locate the switch in the dark. Does this mean I will have to go back to my old bulbs? Do I need to worry about the circuit?</p>

Is the light/fan combo in my shower safe?,"<p>In all of the bathrooms, there is a recessed light/exhaust fan combo installed. I assume, due to the combo feature, is the reason there is no cover over the light fixture.  However, the same light/exhaust is also located inside the master shower - not in the damp area but, the actual wet area.  Visualize yourself taking a shower and looking directly above you as your washing your hair, with water spraying and splashing everywhere, you look right up into the can of the light!  So, out of precaution, we keep the switch off -ALL THE TIME! Is this safe and to code?</p>
",124520,04-10-2017 19:29,Can I put a recessed light in a shower?,"<p>I am in Montgomery County, Maryland and I had a contractor tell me it's against code to put a recessed light in my shower. The shower is 3' X 3' X 7'1"" (3 foot by 3 foot and the height is 7 feet 1 inch). </p>

<p>Here are my questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Can I put a recessed light with shower trim in that shower? (Everything I see says I can)</p></li>
<li><p>Do I need a special high pressure light as it's under 8 feet tall? (And If so, what do I buy?)</p></li>
<li><p>Any other code related questions that I should be aware of?</p></li>

LED bulbs in chandelier periodically all blink at once,"<p>Edit for clarity- The bulbs are not flickering or flashing. They periodically (> 10 minute intervals) turn off and then on in unison.</p>

<p>I have a chandelier with 5 bulbs. I recently replaced all 5 60w incandescent bulbs with 40w equivalent Philips LEDs. The chandelier is on a dimmer.  The bulbs work fine but after about 10 or 15 minutes, all 5 bulbs blink once at the same time. Then there will be another long pause and it will happen again. Rinse. Repeat.</p>

<p>I thought it might be the dimmer which is about 25 years old so I replaced it with a new Leviton slider dimmer(LED compatible). The same thing just happened again. The only common element to the five bulbs is the dimmer switch, right? There are no electronics in the chandelier.</p>

<p>What else could cause them all to act in unison?</p>
",124604,05-10-2017 22:04,Why are my some of my LED lights flickering?,"<p>Something is causing some of my LED lights to flicker in three locations. Here are two examples:</p>

</ol>

<p>There are a few peculiar aspects.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The lights flicker sometimes and not at other times. Each time the flicker period is prolonged. I would say the lights flicker about 30-40% of the time.</p></li>
<li><p>The lights flicker at different ""flicker frequencies"" as you can see in the videos. The flicker frequency also varies from time to time.</p></li>
<li><p>There are three different rooms/circuits where the LED lights flicker. (They don't flicker in other rooms/circuits.) In each of the rooms, the light bulbs are of a different brand. There are 4 brands in total: Torchstar, Feit Electric, Hyperikon, Philips.</p></li>
<li><p>Each of the three rooms uses a different kind of switch: Lutron dimmer (DV-600P), Lutron dimmer (DVW-600PH), and a <strong>dumb switch</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The flicker sometimes stops if I replace one of the lights on the switch with an incandescent bulb.</p></li>
<li><p>In one of the rooms, I have two sets of lights on two different switches, on a single circuit. Occasionally one set flickers more than the other.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A bad connection anywhere along the path is out of the question.</p>

<p>Any insight would be greatly appreciated!</p>

Indoor blower fan turns on and off intermittently in 10-15 min increments when system is off.,"<p>Bit of background: The furnace blower originally did not not turn off at all (or if it did, very rarely did so), even when set temps were reached or when the system was off (fan setting is set to auto, not on). The AC unit outside would shut off when the set temp was reached, but the fan inside continued to blow. I called a technician, who said the issue was probably a bad fan switch relay and it was replaced.</p>

<p>Now the fan does turn off, but it doesn't appear to remain off. Even when the system is set to off, the fan randomly turns back on and off every 10-15 minutes.

As the fan doesn't turn on for a while after the system is off, he wasn't really able to verify that the fan was doing this. He replaced the relay again with a more ""heavy duty"" one, and just told me that even if just the blower is running, it shouldn't draw much power/create a high bill (my HVAC is all electric).</p>

<p>Is there any other reason it could be doing this? Is the relay still the problem?  Or is this how they're supposed to operate (furnace/house is approx. 3 years old)?

Why do I still read voltage on outlet when I turn off breaker?,"<p>I have an GFCI outlet box wired with yellow coated wire, which I believe goes to a dedicated circuit breaker.

<p>This is on the 21st floor of a condo building in Montreal (built in 2014). The building manager said the drywall is approximately 1"" thick (a full inch! not a centimeter).</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is this really possible? (I haven't been able to get confirmation from anyone else).</p></li>
<li><p>If the drywall is really 1"" thick, will the usual drywall anchors be effective? Usually the pictures I see of drywall anchors have them exceed the thickness of the drywall by around 1/2"", and have expanders which end up significantly expanded after the screw is inserted. However, most anchors are at most 1"" long, and in a 1"" thick drywall, there probably won't be much room for the expanders to expand. Will this decrease the effectiveness of the anchors?</p></li>
<li><p>Another issue is the nearby thermostat/light switches. How do I make sure to avoid any of their wiring when drilling in the drywall anchors? Is it important to avoid them? Part of this I suppose comes down to how the wires are arranged behind thew all. Will they for example come bundled in a metal tube? (In this case hitting the metal tube may cause the tube to flex undesirably?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there anything else I need to watch for? How can I tell if there's plumbing behind the wall?</p></li>
<li><p>If I gently drill a small hole, poke into the hole with a toothpick and check there's nothing within an inch behind the wall to worry about, is that a guarantee I'll be fine?</p></li>

Does a sub-panel in an outbuilding require a ground wire or rod?,"<p>My main elect panel in the house has a common neutral/ground bar and not separate bars.  If I run from this panel to a sub panel in a detached pole barn and attach the two hots for 240V and one neutral that is connected to the neutral/ground combination bar in the main panel, am I grounded properly?  Would I also need a ground rod in the pole barn and if so, does it get connected to the neutral bar or is it grounded to the sub panel itself?</p>
",152764,16-12-2018 00:56,How to properly ground a subpanel in detached building?,"<p>I Will be installing a subpanel in a detached garage. The subpanel will be 60 amp. The garage is about 30' from the main-panel in-house, and I will of course get an exact length before selecting the proper gauge wiring. I'll be using pvc underground for the wiring. There is already existing wiring going underground from the house to the garage, which will no longer be used. When it comes to grounding this subpanel, should I run a grounding conductor from the main panel to the new sub, or ground the sub to earth?</p>

<p>Reading <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/a/35670/11105"">this</a> answer sounds like I would have to ground the subpanel to the main, primarily because in my situation this is a new install. All other variables I have control over. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>If so, I would be running 4 wires from the main panel to the sub, 2 hots, 1 neutral, and 1 ground correct? </p></li>
<li><p>Then, at the subpanel, the ground bus bar and the neutral bus bar would not be connected, and the grounding screw removed from the ground bus bar? </p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, a GFCI Breaker must be used at the main, right? I believe this is true for any subpanel in a detached building, just want to be sure.</p></li>

Toilet is leaking around the base,"<p>Last Wednesday, my toilet experienced a small leak around the base. I monitored it for a few days and I didn't see the leak again.

What could this be?</p>
",153060,20-12-2018 02:13,How can I repair a toilet that is leaking at the base?,"<p>Flushing the toilet causes a small amount of water to leak out from under the base of the toilet on one side. Stops after 2-3 seconds. Also noticed there is a higher pitch dripping of water which sounds like it is coming from the top part of the toilet. Lastly, the base of the toilet is slightly loose due to one of the bolts attaching it to the floor coming loose. How bad does this sound? I'm concerned this could cause some rotting to the floor (upstairs) - obviously needs to be fixed but do I really need a plumber or can I unscrew the toilet and fix this myself? I know zilch about plumbing.</p>

Total Amperage and Electical Box Availability,"<p>Good Afternoon Everyone,</p>

<p>I have a few question about amperage sizing. I am looking to install a tankless water heater in our home because its a small home and the current tank water heater is placed right next to the kitchen and upgrading to a tankless water heater would allow the addition of a very much needed pantry to the already small kitchen. Well in preparation to the project I wanted to make sure I had the amperage availability to do so and thus the research started and I have a few questions I couldn't find answers to.</p>

<p>One post a read (I cannot find the link) said that modern houses can have a ""dual pole"" incoming electrical service, so the home actually can have double total available amperage than what is listed. I think the poster was either misleading in his explanation or I am not using the right search terms to find more information on this. Is this a possibility?</p>

<p>I did information gathering and found the rated amperage of all of the major devices in the home and they totaled 176.8 AMPs which is about 88% of the total 200 AMPS my home is currently rated for. Is the AMPs listed in the the maximum amount the devices can pull (such as when the device is first turned on) or is this the average running amperage?</p>

<p>The tankless water heater I want to get is the ECOSMART ECO 24, which has an amperage draw of 100 AMPS.</p>

What could cause only one radiator to not become warm?,"<p>I have gas powered hot water heat in a home I purchased. When I tested it this morning I got a lot of whistling and other noises that subsided for the most part. After the heat had run for 20-30 minutes, I checked it radiator in the house. All the radiators were at least warm, with the exception of one of the radiators upstairs.</p>

<p>What could cause this single radiator to not get warm at all? I noticed slight temperature variances between the other radiators, but this one seemed to not be warm at all. I assume it should get warm if the hot water is flowing through it, and I also assume the hot water must be flowing through it to complete the circuit. So, what gives?</p>

",105128,27-12-2016 01:36,How can I replace a 4-way mechanical switch with occupancy sensor(s)?,"<p>There is a stairwell in our house, which is currently lit by a fixture controlled by three switches: a 4-way and two 3-ways. The wiring was done very recently and, I'm certain, in accordance to modern code (which may help you figure out the diagram, even if <em>I</em> don't know it).</p>

<p>I started with replacing the existing 4-way with a 3-way sensing switch from Lutron (<a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B005WM3C42"" rel=""nofollow"">MS-OPS5M</a>). Predictably, one of the remaining mechanical switches stopped having any effect whatsoever. I was hoping, the second of the remaining mechanical switches will remain in control to allow explicit control of the light. This proved to be incorrect - sometimes it has an effect, some times it does not, and some times it disables the sensing switch (it clicks, but the light stays off).</p>

<p>While the new sensor works perfectly well detecting humans on the same floor, if a person descends the stairs from the upper floor, the light does not go on until one descends to the middle of the stairs - when the feet come to about the same level, where the sensor is.</p>

<p>So, it seems, I need either:</p>

<ul>
<li>One occupancy sensor with a sensor looking up as well as sideways. This would, probably, be the easiest and most sensible option. It will let me remove the remaining mechanical switch.</li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
<li>Two occupancy sensors, that can work together - adding the second to where I currently have the semi-functional mechanical switch. This would provide the most complete sensor-coverage.</li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
<li>Figure out, what's wrong with the current setup - why is the existing mechanical switch misbehaving? I'm sure, I miswired something... Should I replace it with a 1-pole switch now, that I only have 2 switches on the circuit?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Update:</h2>

<p>So I tried to follow <a href=""http://www.lutron.com/TechnicalDocumentLibrary/Maestro_Occ%20Sensor_Switch_Instruction_Guide.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Lutron's diagram</a> linked to by mac and found it easy to connect the sole red wire on the 3-way mechanical switch to one of the black wires.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that did not improve the situation much. Depending on the position of the (newly rewired) mechanical switch, the sensor either works or it does not.</p>

<p>I'm certain, I mis-wired the sensor when replacing the old 4-way switch with it. Could somebody set me straight, please?</p>

<p>In addition to ground, there were four wires connected to the 4-way switch (duh!): two red on one side, and two black on the other. The new switch has 3 connectors: one blue and two black. What do I connect to what?</p>

How do I undo this connection?,"<p>How should I undo this connection? It doesn't seem to unscrew, though part of it will move down towards the boiler although this doesnt seem to make it disconnect (I havent tried forcing this though as I don't want it to break)</p>

<p>Its the mains cold water inlet to a small boiler by the way.</p>

",105344,30-12-2016 11:27,How do I disconnect (and reconnect) the tubing from this fitting?,"<p>The plastic tubing supplying filtered water to our refrigerator currently runs below a suspended ceiling. I want to reroute it above. How do I disconnect it without damage from either the union or tee, so I can reconnect once moved? The tee is labeled NSF-51 Parker Parflex size 4. The union has no discernible markings. I believe I would rather disconnect the union rather than the tee. I didn't want to just start tugging. I have found similar fittings for sale online, but no instructions for use.</p>

<p>Here is the union:<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/g1wxS.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/g1wxS.jpg"" alt=""union""></a> </p>

Heat register under dishwasher,"<p>So we bought a new build and found a heat register is directly under the dishwasher. Where the hvac is completely I stalled, the hardwood floor has not been cut and register dropped in. </p>

<p>My question is, should I complete the project or disconnect the supply line? Is it also normal for this placement? The builder says yes.</p>

<p>My question is, should I have a toe kick vent installed? The builder didn't even cut the floor opening for it, but it is installed under the house. </p>
