"If the universe is 'flat', what shape is it?","<p>As in the title, If the universe is considered to be 'flat', what shape is it?</p>

<p>Is it a disc, elliptical, square, rectangle?</p>

<p>Or is this still unknown as we can only study a small segment of the entire universe, known as the observable universe?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>This previous <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/1299/what-is-the-physical-geometric-shape-of-the-universe"">related question</a> did ask the same thing. However the OP was also asking about if the universe had a centre and if everything (galaxies, dust, stuff etc...) was evenly spread out only along the outer edges. </p>

<p><em>As far as I understand it, the Big Bang that started everything off isn't a typical 'explosion' with a central point. Shapley noted that it appeared as if galaxies are moving away from the Milky Way. We now realise that it is the space between galaxies that is expanding (and that we are not the centre of the universe). in 1998, Hubble then found that the far distant galaxies appear to be moving faster than closer galaxies. This means that the rate of expansion is accelerating. This acceleration rate is known as the Hubble constant.</em></p>

<p>I feel as if the answers focussed more on his sub questions. I found the comments to be more helpful than the answers. </p>

<p><strong>Can I assume that the answer is still as summarized in the related questions comments?</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>'We don't know?'</em></strong></p>

<p>Astromax commented on the question,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, it is indeed flat, meaning Euclidean geometry can be used. Since light travels at a finite rate and the universe is not infinitely old, our 'bubble' of observable stuff within the universe would be in the shape of a sphere centered on us. However, the center of the sphere would change if you decided to move to a different part of the universe. Is the universe infinite? This is not known, since we cannot see passed our observational horizon</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Accepted Answer</p>

<p>To be honest I didn't understand the first half of the accepted answer, and having attempted to read through the <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.5086v2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Planck paper</a> that was linked, I can tell you that I don't know much about astronomy! I kept getting lost in all the new (to me) astonomical terms being thrown about. </p>

<p>I read the second half of the accepted answer to be explaining that the universe has no centre.</p>

<p>Gerald commented on the OP's question about the shape 'shortly' after the big bang,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Something else: Roughly resembling the 3-dimensional surface of 4-dimensional sphere, but not quite symmetrical. The precise shape is not exactly known, but probably not too much distorted, like a torus, a cube or a dodecahedron. This is still under investigation; more precise results are expected within a few years, when polarization of the CMB will be analysed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and went further to clarify the linked Planck paper</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Neither the circles-in-the-sky search nor the likelihood method ﬁnd evidence for a multiply-connected topology"" of the Planck paper, section 6.1 means it's not a torus-like or more complex object with holes.  </p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Second Answer</p>

<p>The more popular second answer, definitely focussed more on answering the 'does the universe have a centre?' question. </p>

<p>Helpful comments to my focus, Astromax commented </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, that the universe is ""infinite"" is not something anyone can prove. The expansion of space-time seems to occur everywhere, but that does not mean that the universe is infinite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stan Lou commented </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Being infinite doesn't imply having no boundary (not by itself, at least). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and ended with </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, a flat 3-torus is a possible geometry, but the geometry does not have to be ""repetitive"" in the sense of wrapping around on itself. It doesn't have to be a torus. Beyond the horizon could be a Euclidean space instead of a flat torus. Or there could be pink unicorns. Or anything else. The point of the horizon is that we don't know what's beyond it. (But if one assumes that the universe is globally isotropic, then it can't be a torus.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the OP summarised it by saying </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So it seems like it boils down to this: It's probably flat, probably 3D. It might be edge-less, or not, we don't know. If yes, might be hypertorus and we could eventually do a round trip and came to starting point. If not, might be a ball, or anything else. We don't know, and can't imagine because of our limited scope. Is this at least remotely aligned with today's theories or are there still some gapping holes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The comments then end, as they moved the discussion to chat.</p>

<p><strong>Can I assume that the answer is still as summarized. 'We don't know?'</strong></p>

How can a black hole ever form?,"<p>We know that an object falling to the black hole, as observed from an observer far away, will freeze as it gets closer and closer to the event horizon. So my question is how can a black hole form in the first place? I mean we usually say thing a star collapses into a blackhole. But considering the effect of ""time-freezing"", how could that be possible in the first place?</p>
",17831,07-08-2016 09:12,Does matter accumulate just outside the event horizon of a black hole?,"<p>My understanding is that time slows and approaches stopping when approaching the event horizon of a black hole.  I have seen this explained several places, including a brief explanation in the last paragraph under: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole#General_relativity"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole#General_relativity</a>, quoted below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oppenheimer and his co-authors interpreted the singularity at the boundary of the Schwarzschild radius as indicating that this was the boundary of a bubble in which time stopped. This is a valid point of view for external observers, but not for infalling observers. Because of this property, the collapsed stars were called ""frozen stars"",[17] because an outside observer  would see the surface of the star frozen in time at the instant where its collapse takes it inside the Schwarzschild radius.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this mean then that no matter actually falls into a black hole (except possibly what was there at its formation)?  Would this also mean matter is accumulating just outside its event horizon?  As I understand it, this would be the perspective from outside the black hole.  If this is the case, I wonder if we would observe a tremendous amount of matter surrounding the event horizon, but it would be extremely red shifted?</p>

<p>I noticed an answer to a different question, especially the end portion, provides some insight here as well:

Is there mass i.e a physical bottom to a black hole?,"<p>All matter has a gravitational pull, a ball, a rock, a planet and a star - the bigger the matter the more it affects the space fabric around it thus having a greater gravitational pull.</p>

<p>I see black holes in the same kind of concept - matter that warps the space fabric/time around it - however as we can physically see a ball, a rock, a planet and a star I fail to visualize what would be the matter that continues a black hole to operate because we cannot see any physical element to it.</p>

<ol>
<li>When a star dies and collapses into a black hole, what is at its center? The star's mass compacted into the size of the plank length, or something similarly small? <strong>Is there really nothing at the center of a black hole?

Centerless expansion or a matter of perspective,"<p>I get this question a lot: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where is the center of the Universe?</p>

<p>I see this question on the internet all of the time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where is the center of the Universe?</p>

The question linked is the last question and answer that I saw before posing this question here, and is in no way the same question, as this question asks how the concept of a centerless universe can work, whereas the question below asks about how a universe can be perceived to be centerless even when it might not be.</p>

<p><strong>Is the Universe centerless? Or does it simply appear to be because of our perspective?</strong>  </p>

<p>$\\\\$<br>
This is about to be a bad example, but please bear with me.  </p>

<p>If you were a bird floating in the ocean, among a myriad of other birds, and you let time pass such that every bird floated away from the other birds in some random fashion. Would you, at some later time when everybirdy was roughly separated from one another, say that based upon your observations of the present conditions, and some evidence that at one point all of the birds were together, that the ocean is centerless? Or could you assume that because of your position in the flock, that from your perspective you can't tell where the center is, nor do you think that from a different birds position would you be able to tell? Creating the illusion of a centerless ocean.</p>

<p>Obviously this requires you not be at or close to the very edge of the flock.</p>

<p>Edit: Also see examples in KenG's posed answer and comments.</p>
",18773,19-10-2016 03:11,How does the concept of a universe with no center work?,"<p>I understand basically that the universe is homogenous (looks the same from every point) and I was told in my astro class that it's supposed to have no center, but how that works boggles my mind. I can't get over the feeling that from some point in the universe a civilization could look in a certain direction and see a sign indicative of the direction towards the edge or the center, like younger galaxies or a lack of galaxies moving a certain direction. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Thanks to Sir Cumference for highlighting some things that are unclear about my question. Sure, to a certain extent you might be able to think of the universe as being without a center, but if you think of a ball growing larger from nothing, and you pick a random point in the growing sphere, you can always say that the point is further from some points on the sphere than others, or in other words, that there is a direction towards a ""center"".</p>

<p>The code <a href=""http://www.iap.fr/magphys/magphys/MAGPHYS.html"" rel=""nofollow"">MAGPHYS</a> specifies Jansky (<code>Jy</code>) as the input unit for flux through a filter (see <code>Section 3.2.3</code> in the <a href=""http://www.iap.fr/magphys/magphys/MAGPHYS_files/readme.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a>). Meaning MAGPHYS wants me to use <code>Jy</code> as unit, when specify the total light of a whole galaxy in e.g. the SDSS-g band. But <code>Jy</code> is a unit of spectral <em>density</em>, i.e. <code>W/m²/Hz</code>. I would expect a flux as input unit when talking about the amont of light coming through a filter, i.e. in <code>W/m²</code> or in $L_\odot$ (solar luminosity), so integrated over all frequencies that go through the filter and weighted by the filter response function.</p>

<p>If I have the absolute AB magnitude of a galaxy in the SDSS-g band, how do I convert it to <code>Jy</code> so that MAGPHYS will be happy?</p>

<p>I'm aware of:</p>

<p>$m_{\text{AB}\nu} = -2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac{f_{\nu}}{3631\text{Jy}}\right) \qquad \text{or} \qquad \left(\frac{f_{\nu}}{\text{Jy}}\right) = 10^{-0.4\  (m_{\text{AB}\nu} - 8.9)}$</p>

<p>But that is in one frequency, not a whole band. </p>

<p>Additionally, I have found the formula below in <a href=""http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/"" rel=""nofollow"">TOPCAT</a>:</p>

Will we start seeing galaxies disappear due to Universe expansion?,"<p>Does the fact that universe is currently expanding at an accelerating rate means that far far away objects (<em>FAO</em>) might start disappearing with time, set aside the ""red shift""? </p>

<p>I'm saying this because from what I understand until now:</p>

<ul>
<li>we receive photons from <em>FAO</em> that were emitted long long ago</li>
<li>now due to space expansion, some of those objects are now moving away at speed greater than the speed of light, but at the time the photons we receive <em>today</em> were emitted, these <em>FAO</em> where not moving away faster than light</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>at t=-11 billion years(By), photons are emitted in a slow expanding universe, and today we can view the object as it was</li>
<li>at t=-2 By, the object moves faster than speed of light, so photon emitted at that time will never reach us, even if we wait the 9 by + ""expansion correction"" needed...</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $n$, $T$, and $x_i$ be the number density of hydrogen, the temperature of the gas, and $n_i/n$, where $n_i$ is the number density of the $i$th component of the interstellar medium. We can then write the criteria for thermal equilibrium as
  $$n^2\Lambda(n,T,x_i)-n\Gamma(n,T,x_i)\equiv n^2\mathcal{L}=0$$
  where $\Lambda$ and $\Gamma$ and the heating and cooling functions, respectively, and $\mathcal{L}$ is defined through those functions and $n$. If the equilibrium is unstable,
  $$\left(\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial S}\right)&lt;0$$
  for entropy $S$.  </p>
  
  <p>This leads to different instability conditions, termed the <em>isochoric</em> and <em>isobaric</em> instabilities (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1965ApJ...142..531F"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Field (1965)</a>, $\text{Eq } 4a,4b$). These can be determined from the temperature, pressure, and density of the gas (also assuming that the gas can be approximated as an ideal gas).</p>

I thought it was a numerical coincidence, until google turned up some results of a possible connection. A lot of it is beyond my head though. </p>

<p>I was under the impression that there are gaps in our knowledge regarding Jupiter's core, which would likely be the driver of its magnetic field. And since solar cycles are related to sunspot activity, which in turn is related to the magnetic field of the Sun, I am struggling to find even a basic understanding of the cause-effect relationship (if there is one). </p>

Is it coincidence that Einstein predicted exactly twice the outcome of Newton for the gravitational deflection of light?,"<p>During a solar eclipse Sir Arthur Eddington measured the deflection of star light by the Sun. Einstein predicted a deflection of 1.74 arc seconds, but according to Newton the deflection should have been 0.86 arc seconds. So is it a coincidence that the prediction of Einstein is twice as large or is there a kind of law involved which makes Einstein's outcome of his GR twice as big as that according to Newton?</p>

<p>Question is: Why? I've read a lot about this, and I can see how when one integrates the Newtonian acceleration along the photon path with constant |v|=c this gives the 'correct' Newtonian value - but intuitively, I can't wrap my head around it.

Plumes vs Geyser,"<p>I've read, that on Enceladus scientists observed plumes containing water vapor. Can I use plumes and geysers interchangeable? if not, What's the difference between Plumes and Geysers?</p>

<p>thanks!</p>
",21015,14-05-2017 10:35,"Enceladus; why use the words ""geysers"", ""jets"", and ""plumes"" interchangeably?","<p><strong>Background, Europa:</strong></p>

<p>In an earlier question <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/q/18496/7982"">How can “Geysers” on Europa reach heights of 100km?</a> I brought up the use of the word ""geyser"" in association with the reported confirming observations of water vapor plumes on Europa. Europa size and surface gravity are nearly as large as those of Earth's moon. With an escape velocity of about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2,025 m/s</a> it was hard for me to understand how an <em>actual geyser</em> could exist within the ice, a geyser so powerful that it could be shooting liquid water from the surface at 2 kilometers per second. </p>

<p>Part of the problem here is that I still can't be absolutely sure there is a clear definition of what is or isn't an <em>actual geyser</em> on solar system bodies other than Earth. On Earth, while a geyser is usually powered by geothermal conversion of water into steam, it pushes additional liquid water up to and above the surface as liquid. I believe that other sources of pressure may still result in proper Earth geysers.</p>

<p>Most scientific references I found referred to the vapor as plumes or jets, the word geyser was used in more popular and general interested articles.</p>

<p>It seems one likely explanation is a venting of water vapor (gas) from a particularly shaped vent can accelerate the molecules to an average velocity that is several times the speed of sound by converting random thermal motion to directed vertical motion, as described in a <a href=""https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/34041"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">U.T. Austin thesis by Jared James Berg</a>. Simulations there showed that this jet phenomenon can result in some water vapor reaching a substantial fraction of escape velocity, and rise to 100 to 200km altitudes. The model also addresses the formation of solids as ice crystals within the plume.</p>

<p><strong>About Enceladus:</strong></p>

<p>I have just come across the paper <a href=""http://ciclops.org/media/sp/2014/7927_18911_0.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">How the Geysers, Tidal Stresses, and Thermal Emission Across the South Polar Terrain of Enceladus are Related</a>, (Porco, DiNino and Nimmo (2014), Ast. J. 148 (3), 45), an in depth study of sources of water vapor from Enceladus. I saw that both geysers and jets were mentioned in the abstract, but at the end of the second paragraph in the introduction I ran into the very interesting sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Throughout this paper, we use the terms “jets” and “geysers” interchangeably.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The escape velocity on Enceladus is only about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">240 m/s</a>, <em>nearly an order of magnitude lower</em> than that on Europa, which means much less sub-surface pressure would be required to push liquid water high above the surface into near space. So I can understand that the term geyser might be more likely to be appropriate for these plumes than it would be for the plumes on higher surface gravity Europa.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>I would know why the words ""geysers"" and ""jets""/""plumes"" would be used interchangeably. Is this because it hasn't been confirmed yet what they are, and the authors don't wish to show favoritism by choosing one or the other, or are they synonymous and can always be used interchangeably, or si there some other reason?</p>

Tidal locking of a moon,"<p>When a moon is in orbit around it's planet but is so close that it will become tidally locked does it experience a large 'wobble' in between the phase when it still has its own rotation and the final phase when it is always showing the same face to the planet?  I can only imagine that it would 'wobble' very widely, back and forth like a pendulum until finally settling into a locked position.  </p>
",21583,10-07-2017 13:45,Is there any residual oscillation left from the Moon rotation?,"<p>The Moon is tidally locked to Earth - a long time ago it was spinning, but after a time, the spin stopped - two factors stabilizing it: unequal mass distribution creating an equilibrium position where there's one ""preferred"" axis by which it faces Earth - an attractor, and the dynamic tidal forces acting as stress upon its structure, dissipating the energy - a friction, reducing the rotation speed.</p>

<p>So, at one point in time, it would no longer complete a full spin, but instead reverse its turn direction, start spinning in opposite direction, with maximum spin speed around the time where the ""preferred"" axis faces Earth, then slowing down again, until its spin stops, and reverses direction again - each time the angle smaller as the dynamic forces act against the direction of rotation - but also, with the rotation angle and angular velocity dropping, the value of the dynamic forces dropping.</p>

<p>There is a significant apparent wobble caused by the orbit's eccentricity, and possibly some actual continuous wobble, as the result - with the attractor axis missing Earth as result. But is there any long-term oscillation left over from the times when the Moon was spinning - a harmonic motion around its original spin axis, that would likely not be in tune with the orbital period? (I imagine the period of these oscillations would be very long; after all it's about reversing Moon's spin back and forth, by a force that isn't all that strong.)</p>

Long-period comets, in particular, enter the solar system from its outer reaches. Jupiter’s gravity is thought to sling most of these fast-moving ice balls out of the solar system before they can get close to Earth. So long-period comets are thought to strike Earth only on very long timescales of millions or tens of millions of years.

Why does the moon not leave its orbit around the earth due to the gravitational force from the sun?,"<p>See additional information below added after the answer to the question.</p>

<p>When the moon is between the earth and the sun, the gravitational force on the moon from the sun is greater than the gravitational force from the earth, hence the moon should continue its path towards the sun instead of staying in its orbit around the earth.</p>

<p>When the moon is at 90 degrees to the earth relative to the sun, the moon is moving almost directly towards the sun and then the gravitational force on the moon from the sun is roughly double the gravitational force from the earth, hence there is nothing to stop the moon's trajectory towards the sun and it should continue towards the sun away from the earth. What makes the moon ""turn"" back towards the earth and away from the sun at the point where it is right between the earth and the sun when at this point right when it turns, the gravitational force from the sun is roughly double the gravitational force from the earth?</p>

<p>I am aware of the movement of the sun and also of the fact that the moon is moving on a different plane to that of the earth and I don't think that can explain my question above.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time, I would like to understand this situation.</p>

<hr>

<p>Additional information:</p>

<p>The answer does not address the question, let me explain. Although it is true that the moon orbits the sun as described in the answer, this does not explain why the sun does not pull the moon out of its orbit around the earth.</p>

<p>For an object to change direction a net force has to be applied to it according to Newtons laws. a=F/m applied to the moon from the point in its orbit where the moon gets closer to the sun than the earth is to the sun, shows a force vector on the moon towards the sun applying twice the force as another force vector on the moon towards the earth. This results in a combined net force vector on the moon pointing away from the earth and this net force vector will progressively point further away from the earth and more towards the sun as the moon moves closer to the sun and therefore should pull the moon out of its orbit around the earth and pull it towards the sun.</p>

<p>Newtons laws must be true on the three separate objects; the sun, the earth and the moon in the example above.</p>

<p>I have a Master of Science in Engineering and know my physics. I have some friends who are convinced they can prove that the earth is actually flat and that a search on ""flat earth"" will prove it, and they have asked me the question in this thread to prove to me that the heliocentric model is not true. I took up the challenge, however when looking at this simple example I have not been able to find an answer that is in accordance with normal physical laws. </p>

"Finding a location geographically of a celestial object, in this case the moon at one of its quarters","<p>Years ago it was mentioned to me the New Yorker magazine had a Young Moon “contest”; who could find the youngest moon; the thinnest crescent after a new moon. I knew enough to know that I would have to know exactly when the new moon occurred and more importantly where. The Thin Crescent wouldn’t be too hard as it would follow closely the sun. Still, not knowing where the new moon happened meant that I could see anything from nothing to a one day old moon. I knew the moon traversed about 13 degrees of arc a day in so doing about 7% Of its disc was illuminated so my chance of seeing a very thin crescent depended on the new moon happening to the east of me by some 6 to 12 hours, as the “record” was something in the realm of 9hours.</p>

<p>So the question arose in me “Where on the globe would an observer see any of the quarterly phases exactly over their meridian?” This question led to almanacs that used hours, minutes, seconds and hundredths of seconds of measurements, all starting from the celestial spheres Greenwich or zero longitude, the Vernal Equinox, that semi-fixed(a 26,000 year cycle) starting place for celestial longitude.

Is it fruitful to search for a correlation between rates of in-falling matter in black holes and the expansion rate of our universe?,"<p>To my understanding, white holes are hypothetical objects that are time-reversed black holes; black holes gravitationally ""suck in"" matter whereas white holes ""spit"" matter back out. As such, I think it's a nice idea that the Big Bang could be the ""spitting of matter"" via a white hole (assuming such an object exists). </p>

<p>This got me wondering how one could experimentally test for such an object. Since the expansion rate of the universe is increasing, could one possible explanation be that a white hole is continually ""spitting out"" matter such that an increase of flux of in-falling matter/space could be observed as an increasing rate of expansion of out-pouring matter/space? While I don't know of a way to detect this, I was wondering whether the following idea was fruitful or not. </p>

<p>Given that a supermassive black hole is believed to be at the center of every galaxy, given that most galaxies (sans Andromeda) are receding away at a speed proportional to their distance relative to us observers, and given that the spatial distribution of matter in our universe is isotropic and homogeneous, could one build a simulation of such a concept? To emulate isotropy and homogeneity, one could use a random number generator corresponding to a uniform distribution to place ""galaxies"" along a grid; accounting for gravitational forces, one can simulate the time-evolution of these galaxies and compare rates of in-falling matter to find a correlation between the rate of in-falling matter and the expansion rate of the universe (likely as a function of time-elapsed, and age and size per black hole). While the simulation does not definitely prove anything, providing a correlation could be interesting in my opinion.</p>

<li>It was the matter engulfed by a Black hole.  </li>
<li>Matter was created inside the White hole.  </li>
</ol>

<p>My search on wiki stated that:  </p>

<p>According to Penrose Diagram of Schwarzschild radius, objects first leave the White hole and then may enter into a Black hole. But, due to Hawking radiation, a Black hole can achieve thermal equilibrium with gas of radiation. This equilibrium state is reversal invariant, implying that time reversal of a Black hole is again a Black hole. This means that a Black hole and a White hole are same objects.</p>

<p>My 2nd candidate suggests that the big-bang was a white hole. I thought of ruling this out because it requires the existence of a white hole before the big-bang.  </p>

<p>This forced me to draw the conclusion that a white hole must either be inside a black hole or behind it. </p>

<p>Is this correct (provided that we haven't yet proven the existence of a White hole)? Where am I wrong?</p>

I understand that they can form near the event horizon of a black hole, and that one particle can fall in, where as the other particle can barely escape.  I understand that an anti-particle will annihilate with a particle.  What I don't understand is why only the anti-particles of these virtual particle pairs fall into the black hole, while the other ones just manage to escape.  Shouldn't both particle and anti-particle have equal chance to be the one to fall in, or just manage to escape?</p>

<p>It seems that there should be an equal chance of either the particle, or the anti-particle, would be captured while the other ""ejected.""  So it seems that the black hole should be somewhat steady-state as far as mass change with respect to virtual particles.</p>

Why stars are not visible in photos of Planets from space,"<p>The night sky from many parts of the Earth, away from any city lights and pollution, is full of starts, mostly the stars of the Milky Way Galaxy is what fills the night sky densely.</p>

<p>In many photos of outer space capturing the planets of the solar system there is always the black background, not even one single star to be found (I searched for photos of Saturn, Jupiter and even Earth, didn't find any peck of light around it which may be a star)</p>

<p>My question is, why this happens? I've told myself regularly that there can be three reasons for that</p>

<ol>
<li>The exposure of the camera is too low to capture the stars that might luckily be in the background of a planet's photo.</li>
<li>The stars are too spread out each other that in most of the photos there might not even be a star in the dark space behind the planet. </li>
<li>The telescopes taking the photos aren't powerful enough to take the photos of the stars clearly (very much related to the 1st point, but instead of the exposure of the camera I believe it is the telescope that's not capable or maybe made for that)</li>
</ol>

<p>I understand the general idea of the equation of time and how the difference in clock time and solar time answer my original question, but I’m struggling to grasp how the tilt of the Earth contributes to the equation of time. </p>

<p>I’m trying to visualise the effect, and assuming it is to do with the point at which the sun is highest in the sky not being in the middle of sunset and sunrise (except at solsitces and equinoxes?). So, is this correct? Is there any good way of trying to visualise it ? </p>

<p>I’m a bit confused by the wikipedia entry
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time#Obliquity_of_the_ecliptic"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time#Obliquity_of_the_ecliptic</a> saying</p>

<ol>
<li>“If this effect operated alone, then days would be up to 24 hours and 20.3 seconds long (measured solar noon to solar noon) near the
solstices, and as much as 20.3 seconds shorter than 24 hours near
the equinoxes” </li>
<li>“the inclination of the ecliptic results in the contribution of a sine wave variation with an amplitude of 9.87 minutes and a period
of a half year to the equation of time. The zero points of this sine
wave are reached at the equinoxes and solstices”.
Is point 1 correct ?</li>

Black Hole growth,"<p>The latest info on black holes with regard to their formation is that since space and time go to infinity at the event horizon, from an outside perspective nothing ever enters a black hole, and it also takes an infinite amount of time for the black hole actually to form. Thus, from an outside perspective, no black hole ever is completely finished becoming a black hole, and because of Hawking Radiation, every black hole will evaporate before it fully becomes a black hole, so there will never actually be any fully formed black holes in the universe. Fine, no problem. Question is, since nothing ever enters a black hole, do black holes actually grow in size (that is, the event horizon getting bigger), or are they forever restricted to their original size (apart from two black holes combining to form a larger event horizon)?</p>

<p>This is not about matter accreting on the event horizon; that's the issue, in fact. Rather than crossing the EH and entering the BH, matter seems to accrete on the EH and never goes in. So the BH never grow, the EH never gets larger due to accretion of matter.</p>

<p>The outside observer is not infinitely far away; it's space-time that goes to infinity at the Event Horizon. In fact, it seems to be true that the closer one gets to the EH, the further away one is and the longer it takes to get there, approaching being infinitely far away in both space and time.</p>
",26067,26-04-2018 14:56,Does matter accumulate just outside the event horizon of a black hole?,"<p>My understanding is that time slows and approaches stopping when approaching the event horizon of a black hole.  I have seen this explained several places, including a brief explanation in the last paragraph under: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole#General_relativity"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole#General_relativity</a>, quoted below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oppenheimer and his co-authors interpreted the singularity at the boundary of the Schwarzschild radius as indicating that this was the boundary of a bubble in which time stopped. This is a valid point of view for external observers, but not for infalling observers. Because of this property, the collapsed stars were called ""frozen stars"",[17] because an outside observer  would see the surface of the star frozen in time at the instant where its collapse takes it inside the Schwarzschild radius.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this mean then that no matter actually falls into a black hole (except possibly what was there at its formation)?  Would this also mean matter is accumulating just outside its event horizon?  As I understand it, this would be the perspective from outside the black hole.  If this is the case, I wonder if we would observe a tremendous amount of matter surrounding the event horizon, but it would be extremely red shifted?</p>

Do gravitational waves have distinct bands or parameters from which a source redshift can be inferred?,"<p>In optical astronomy, much (most?) electromagnetic radiation is emitted at well defined frequencies, and this can be used to infer a redshift for the source, and hence its recessional velocity, age, or distance.</p>

<p>I haven't read anything specifically suggesting well defined source frequencies for gravitational wave astronomy, which would allow a redshift to be calculated the same way. I assume there would be a redshift effect since like EM radiation a gravitational wave propagates at (or exceedingly close to) the speed of light. But then again it propagates as a <em>ripple in</em> spacetime rather than a phenomenon <em>embedded in</em> spacetime, so perhaps not.</p>

<p>""If recession velocity at the location of a traveling photon were greater than the speed of light the entire time the photon from a distance galaxy were traveling, we would never observe the photon.""</p>

<p>It seems like common sense that at a certain distance, space is expanding faster than light, thus preventing light beyond a certain distance from reaching Earth which means we can't directly measure galaxies traveling faster than light, but we can imply that they do by projecting their velocity beyond the observable universe. But who's right?</p>

<p>If a galaxy used to be within the observable universe, we can measure photons from that galaxy reaching Earth despite that that galaxy may be currently outside the observable radius of the universe. Galaxies can be projected as travelling faster than light due to the expansion of space, but I haven't seen that we can directly measure them as doing such since the redshift of photons is proportional do the amount of space that is expanding between us and a certain distance. </p>

Could dark matter be wrong?,"<p>As I understand, the evidence for dark matter is the observation of the gravitational dynamics of objects around the size of galaxies and above.  They move in a way such that the equations imply there is more mass than what we can see.  There has never been any direct observation of dark matter, and our theories tell us it cannot be composed of any elementary particles from the standard model.  Furthermore, there is no observation which suggests that dark matter is unevenly distributed, that some galaxies consisting of roughly the same amount of normal matter have varying amounts of dark matter.</p>

<p>I wonder if therefore an alternative explanation for the phenomena is that we have the wrong dynamical equations for gravity.  Just as Newtonian gravitation is a good approximation to general relativity at low masses/energies, perhaps general relativity is a good approximation to the true gravitational theory at sub-galactic distances.  Maybe when distances become very large we start seeing that gravatational force is described by slightly different curves than what general relativity predicts.</p>

<p>Is there any good evidence speaking against this alternative approach?</p>

<p>The reason this question is different from the ""possible duplicate"" is that the other question asks if the source of the effect attributed to dark matter is parallel universes, rather than different dynamical laws.  However, the answer there does mention these alternative gravitational theories.</p>

That was fine and all until I realized that wormholes would be exclusively extrinsic, how could you make a wormhole if bending space is intrinsic? Obviously you can't. But Einstein  put a lot of time into something that apparently wouldn't work, so personally I am siding with Einstein here.

Can a planet's changing tilt be aligned with the rotation around its star?,"<p>What I'm asking is if the tilt of a planet can ""follow"" the rotation around its star so that, for example, its north pole would always lean towards the star, and thus always be under daylight. The planet could have a tilt similar to earth's 23.5°. And can that planet have a rotation around its axis, allowing for day/night cycles closer to the equator? Hopefully this image will explain what I mean. The tilt (red line) stays the same, but the pole is leaning toward the star throughout the whole year, while the planet rotates around its axis.

How much iron does a star fuse before going supernova?,"<p>I understand stars fuse atoms into heavier and heavier elements. When the star starts to fuse iron, the amount of energy released is less than the amount of energy it to takes to fuse the atoms. This creates an energy deficiency and the core is unable to maintain its outward pressure against gravity's inward collapse. The star collapses, rebounds against electron degeneracy pressure (I believe?) and goes BOOM. But how much iron is actually fused? And, for how long is the star fusing iron before the collapse? </p>

<p>Also, as a little bonus, I read somewhere recently that the presence of nickel is possible prior to going supernova. I can't find where though. Was that person wrong? </p>

<p>I have a few questions that I am not sure about:</p>

<p>1) <strong>Do all planets transit their parent sun?</strong> It would seem to me that if all planets ""cross"" their parent star in some form, then depending on our point of view, we should be able to see the transits. For example, we never see a Mars transit, but if we alter our point of view to be farther then mars, then we would.</p>

<p>2) <strong>If all the planets are in the same orbital plane, would the transit of one, imply the transit of all the others</strong>? For example, our solar system is relevatily in the same plane, and it seems like Mercury/Venus transit, would also imply earth and beyond transits. We just have to be in right <strong>perspective</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>3) If a planet transits its star, does the probability of a transit increase/decrease/same if planet semi major axis changes</strong>? I am not sure about this one. I still think that it would be 100% <strong>the fact</strong> that a <strong>transit</strong> will occur, but its more unlikely that we would ever see it, because we need our angle to be just right.</p>

<p>4) <strong>If a planetary system has multiple planets, would we detect transits from several planets if they are all in the same orbital plane, or if they have different orbital planes</strong>? This kind of builds off of #2, and I think the answer is the same orbital plane, because the ""different"" orbital planes could be such that are 90 degrees from our point of view, meaning we would never see the transit.</p>

<p>I want to know if my understanding of transits is correct by these questions. Thanks!</p>

In a Q&amp;A session, a listener had asked what would happen if Superman really did stop the earth from rotating and rotated it in the other direction. Prof. Tyson's response was that if the earth, which is rotating at approx. 1000mph about its axis, is stopped, everything that is not anchored on earth will move the opposite direction at 1000mph and we'd all go crashing into things at that speed.</p>

<p>I suppose that is just simple inertia: if a body moving at 1000mph is stopped abruptly, everything that was moving with it but not attached to it would indeed attempt to continue in the same direction at 1000mph. However, the earth is <em>rotating</em> rather than moving in a straight line. Essentially, gravity is strong enough to ensure that we are not thrown off into space by the centrifugal force from the earth's rotation (we aren't holding on to our dear lives as the earth turns at 1000mph). So in a sense, aren't we <em>anchored</em> to earth by gravity? And therefore, doesn't it mean that if the earth stopped abruptly, we'd just stop with it? (I'm thinking of say a centrifuge with test tubes attached to it. Though as I think about this, I feel that we'd sway at the point of attachment instead of stand still, were the earth to stop).</p>

Infalling observer could never cross Black Hole event horizon?,"<p>I have an interest in cosmology, but I would no way consider myself an expert. It would be great if the more knowledgeable contributors would be able to answer the question I have posed.</p>

<p>The intense gravitational field near a black hole causes time dilation. This means, to an observer close to its event horizon, time  runs more slowly. It can mathematical be expressed as:</p>

<p>Time dilation = <span class=""math-container"">$\frac{\delta t_f}{\delta t_0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{R_s}{R}}}$</span>. </p>

<p>Where <span class=""math-container"">$\delta t_f$</span> is an interval of time a long distance from the black hole, <span class=""math-container"">$\delta t_0$</span> is the time interval a distance <span class=""math-container"">$R$</span> from the black hole’s centre and <span class=""math-container"">$R_s$</span> is the radius of the event horizon. </p>

<p>This formula means that time dilation becomes <strong>infinite</strong> at the event horizon so to a distant observer a falling object would take an infinite time to reach the event horizon and would never cross it.  However, in the frame of an observer falling into the black hole it should them take a finite time to reach the event horizon. To me the complexity is that all black holes are believed to <strong>‘evapourate’ and eventually disappear in a finite time</strong>, by emitting Hawking radiation. Although this an incredibly slow process. For example, a solar mass hole would have a lifetime of <span class=""math-container"">$10^{66}$</span> years (in a time-frame measured a distance from the black hole).  </p>

<p><strong>My Question</strong>
Assuming Hawking radiation exists and  black hole evaporation occurs, does this mean that an infalling observer would never actually reach the event horizon, because the black hole has finite lifetime and would evaporate before an infalling observer would reach it?</p>

<p><strong>Further Note</strong>
Since posing this question I have had one further thought, which may or may be relevant, since my knowledge of GR and quantum theory is pretty sketchy. </p>

<p>The way that the time dilation formula works is that when the observer is a distance of one Planck length ( ~ <span class=""math-container"">$10^{-35}$</span> m ) away from the event horizon of a solar mass black hole (which has radius ~3km), the time dilation would be still only be  ~ <span class=""math-container"">$10^{19}$</span>. However, the lifetime of a solar mass black hole is ~<span class=""math-container"">$10^{66}$</span> years. Therefore, even when they are within 1 Planck length of the event horizon, the time dilation near the black hole is not sufficient for the observer to see the black hole evaporate. </p>

Past the event horizon of a black hole, any moving particle instantaneously experiences a gravitational acceleration towards the black hole that will cancel out it's current velocity, even light. That means that the gravity well of the black hole must be able to accelerate from -C¹ to 0 instantly². Given that fact, we can assume the gravitational acceleration of black holes is C/instant³. Given this, it stands to reason that in successive instants, the particle will be moving at speeds greater than C, because it is experiencing greater gravitational forces and continuous gravitational acceleration.</p>

<p>Does this actually make sense? Is there something I'm missing here? By this logic, it seems like anything inside of the event horizon of a black hole could and should move faster than C due to gravitational acceleration. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I showed this question to a friend and he questioned if the hypothetical particles that were radiating from the singularity (The photon traveling exactly away from the black hole) might be hawking radiation; that is, the gravitation acceleration of a black hole is only strong enough to curve the path of light around a non-zero radius (thus not actually stopping it, but altering it's course), and not powerful enough to decelerate light. Is this actually what hawking radiation is, or is he as confused as I am?</p>

<hr>

<p>¹ Where movement towards the singularity would be considered a positive value, movement away from the singularity is a negative value, that is, anything moving at the speed of light away from the singularity would be moving with a velocity of -C relative to the singularity.</p>

<p>² If it couldn't accelerate from -C to 0 instantly, any photon traveling exactly away from the black hole would be able to escape the event horizon.</p>

<p>The ""gravity slingshot"" maneuver we've seen in sci-fi and even used by our own spacecraft relies on the physics of hyperbolic orbits, where an object both enters and exits the orbit before making a single lap around the planet/moon/etc. Since gravity pushes the craft toward that body both while they're heading towards and away from it, <strong>shouldn't the craft's velocity be the same at</strong> (for example) <strong>1 megameter before the periapsis as 1 megameter after?</strong> If so, then the gravity slingshot maneuver should only have the end purpose of redirecting the craft's trajectory, not of increasing its speed, as the name implies.</p>

What causes cold temperature extremes?,"<p>Recently I looked into the coldest(and hottest, but in another question) natural places. I discover this to be the Boomerang Nebula, with a freezing temperature of about −272.15 °C. Then I looked at the reason.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The outflowing gas is moving outwards at a speed of about 164 km/s and
expanding rapidly as it moves out into space; this gas expansion
results in the nebula's unusually low temperature.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Now I am sort of confused. How exactly can expanding gas lose heat, and lose it to such extent?

",31890,16-05-2019 11:47,"Is the moon ""perfectly"" tidally locked and, if not, how long would it take us to observe it's rotation?","<p>I have a general understanding of how and why a body in space can be tidally locked to it's planet or sun and I'm aware that our moon is in such a state.</p>

<p>My question is, if our moon once had a rotation, has it slowed down to a point where across the course of our normal lifetimes we can't observe it's spin but across the span of hundreds, if not thousands, of years we could observe its current rotation?  In other words, if it has a rotation and if I looked at the moon today and jumped into the future, how far would I have to go to see a noticeable difference?  </p>

<p>If the question is to relative then I'll ask it like this-- at the moons current rate of rotational speed and deceleration, how long would it take for the moon to rotate, say, 15 degrees on it's current axis?  I assume this would be enough to make the moon look ""different"" to the naked eye so I'll go with that concrete figure.</p>

<p>...or is the moon in either a state of near-equilibrium or is it ""wobbling"" due to other forces outside the gravitational pull of the earth (e.g. pull of the sun, asteroid bombardment, comets passing by, etc.) having minor effects on its rotational state and thus making it's rotation inconsistent and unobservable?</p>

it was of similar brightness to the surrounding stars and weirdly wasn't moving in a single direction. it was moving erratically in no particular path, was not constrained to a specific area and almost mimicked what a laser point would look like if a human was moving it randomly.

Four Lights (star like) Moving in a Line Together,"<p>About 20 minutes ago, we saw four lights lined up and moving relatively quickly across the sky. These lights looked exactly like the stars around them - not red or blue or flashing or anything, just four stars at first glance. The spacing between them remained constant as they traveled in a straight line together (moving from West to East). The two in the middle were slightly closer to one another than the two in the front and back of the line, but the spacing was otherwise equal and constant - as if they'd been strung together on a line that was begging pulled forward. </p>

<p>They moved as quickly as a plane might when making a final approach to land, but there were no other lights visible around them and no sound.

How to identify component of velocity of a star from its red shift?,"<p>When a telescope observes a distant star, all it sees is the light being emitted by the star.

<p>However recently I have read that photons need around 100 000 years to reach the Earth, since the reactions are happening at Sun's core, and gamma rays can't leave the Sun without interacting with other particles, unlike neutrinos for example.</p>

<p>Is that theory correct? If the Sun's core ""shut down"", would we still receive photons (light) for another 100 000 years, with only neutrinos disappearing immediately?</p>

"Aligning of 7 unidentified objects in the sky, what are they?

<p>East North East in the sky there seemed to be 9 vertically aligned stars and 2 horizontally aligned stars with the lower second to last star - making an alternative shaped cross. On looking closer I realised they were moving (so definitely not stars then), altogether at first (downwards in the sky) but then as I carried on with what I was doing while watching as best I could, they’d skew a little in alignment then move back - within 10 mins I’d lost nearly all of them and could only see 2. </p>

<p>Anybody have any idea what these may be? They were white in colour to the naked eye, as bright as the surrounding stars except for one just to the right hand corner of the top ‘object’ (which was slightly brighter) and we’re moving quickly enough for me to notice but not enough to stop me immediately questioning my eyes. </p>

Expansion of the universe and visibility of distant galaxies,"<p>The universe expands at an accelerating rate, which makes me wonder if at a certain point the speed of expansion between two points will exceed the speed of light. In that case, it might eventually become impossible for two gravitationally bound clusters of the universe to exchange light.

<ul>
<li>Who decided to name them like this?</li>

</ul>

<p>Finally, the ultimate question is: if the planets got named by the Romans, implying they had not technology to observe the solar system whatsoever, why some of the names match the color of the planets? </p>

<ul>
<li>Mars is red - Mars is the god of war</li>
<li>Neptune is blue - Neptune is the god of the oceans</li>

Did a galaxy get discovered more than 30 billion light-years away? How does one observe light older than the estimated age of the universe?,"<p>I'm more into questioning mainstream science and pseudo-science to remain open-minded.</p>

<p><em>Why is it that we are seeing light 30 billion light years away; when the estimated age of the universe is much younger?
How does space-stretching circumvent the light-speed limit?</em></p>
",34820,25-01-2020 16:25,Why is the observable Universe larger than its age would suggest?,"<p>The age of the Universe is estimated at 13.8 billion years, and current theory states nothing can exceed the speed of light, which can lead to the incorrect conclusion that the universe can't have a radius of more than 13.8 billion light years.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe"">Wikipedia</a> deals with this misconception as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This reasoning would only make sense if the flat, static <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space"">Minkowski spacetime</a> conception under special relativity were correct. In the real Universe, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime"">spacetime</a> is curved in a way that corresponds to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_expansion_of_space"">expansion of space</a>, as evidenced by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law"">Hubble's law</a>. Distances obtained as the speed of light multiplied by a cosmological time interval have no direct physical significance. → <em>Ned Wright, <a href=""http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/Dltt_is_Dumb.html"">""Why the Light Travel Time Distance should not be used in Press Releases""</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That doesn't clear the matter up for me, and having no science or maths background beyond high school, further reading into Hubble's law isn't helping much either.</p>

<p>One layman's explanation I've seen offers explanation that the Universe itself isn't bound by the same laws as things <em>within</em> it. That would make sense – insofar as these things can – but the above quote (<em>""Distances obtained as the speed of light multiplied by a cosmological time interval have no direct physical significance""</em>) seems more general than that.</p>

<p>Can anyone offer (or direct me to) a good layman's explanation?</p>

But my main question; these days I felt into mood of having a general knowledge in Astronomy etc. everything related to stars and space.</p>

1- Some elementary sources which people who doesn't have any background can read them. The notes be exciting and the reader wants to continue it until its end.
2- Sources which also use mathematics (specially if the level of the math won't be only some calculus) but the dominant text be about stars and space.</p>

<p>Assume you are suggesting a text to a person as his first thing he will read in this topic. And if you think a series or a number of texts are suitable, please give an order to which should be read first and then which for the next and so on.

<p>2) If the reason #1 above didn't form a black hole is one of several explanations such as inflation or whatever else, then why didn't all the mass and energy form a big black hole at some finite time <em>after</em> this big bang happened?  For instance, I've (possibly incorrectly) heard that inflation made the universe the size of an orange.  Well why didn't it form a black hole then?  Or once the universe expanded to, say, the size of the moon.  Why not then?  Just insert whatever reasonable size you want in place of ""orange"" or ""moon.""  The question is why didn't a black hole form out of all the matter and energy after the big bang?</p>

<p>As per my understanding. Galaxies moving apart at high speed is due to the increase in space between the galaxies (i.e. new space is created between galaxies that push the galaxies apart).

"Why is rotational motion absolute, is the universe spinning?","<p>When considering any object, one can say its translational movement is relative, depending on the point of view or reference frame adopted. If it moves at 1/4c relative to some observer, one might say it is the observer that moves at 1/4c and the object is stationary relative to it. It has no internal acceleration.</p>

<p>Experimentation at small scale will tell that a spinning object displays increasing internal acceleration the further away from its center of mass it is measured. -centrifugal force-</p>

<p>This forbids rotational motion to be understood as something relative, in the same way as uniform rectilinear motion is, so that when an object spins around its center of mass, noone could say ""No, this object is rotationally stable, it's the entire universe that spins around it."" </p>

<p>Fundamentally, why and how is rotational motion absolute in this way, and how could we know if the universe is or is not spinning at larger scale, at some spinning rate we cannot measure since we're trapped in this spinning reference frame, unable to detect it experimentally since it's too huge?</p>

And why wasn't Kepler designed to change its pointing so it could cover several fields, such as all of the above?

Multiple star-like looking objects moving across the sky,"<p>I know this question has been asked before, and not only on this resource. But none of the answers look satisfactory to my case.</p>

<p>So yesterday shortly after dusk, rouhgly around 18 UTC (local 21PM, I live in Ukraine), I observed a number of objects moving across the sky. In total, I counted 12 of them.
They were moving at more or less the same speed, though some of them were a bit faster (distance shortened), distances between objects vary, but in general the distance was rather big - during the movement, the first one disappeared while the last one had not yet arrived. I counted around 7-8 of them visible at the same time at the beginning, stretched across the sky. The latter ones were a bit delayed. It took several minutes for one object to cross the sky, like 3-4. Sadly, I wasn't smart enough (or too fascinated) to take exact measurements.</p>

<p>Their brightness reminded very much brightness of clearly visible stars with naked eye. I woud say somewhere around 1m (though this is very inaccurate), or maybe the brightness of Betelgeuse (but without reddish). (not as brigh as Venus, less bright then Sirius which was clearly visible at the time). The objects did not leave any trails and did not blink.
Jokes aside, I did not consume any drugs, alcohol or medicine that could change my perception of reality. Moreover, my significant one was nearby and also observed it.
So what could it be?</p>

<ul>
<li>Not a flock of birds - they do not fly stretched like that, and are not so bright at night.</li>
<li>A group of satellites? Then, why are they so stretched? Is there a group that consists of 12 (or there might be more) units? What's the reason for some of them to be faster?</li>
<li>Airplanes. These ones did not blink, and in general moved faster then airplane moves across the sky (unless it was some hypersonic aircraft group that do not have any blinking/colored lights on them). </li>
<li>Some other flying objects. </li>
</ul>

A question regarding the evolution of black holes,"<p>It is known that for an outside observer who is stably outside the  a black hole, never sees an object falling in go beyond the black hole. So does it mean that even though the mass of black hole increases, and hence the event horizon too moves out, the observer never sees any such thing, and to him the size of the black hole can never increase?</p>
",35968,28-04-2020 15:04,Does matter accumulate just outside the event horizon of a black hole?,"<p>My understanding is that time slows and approaches stopping when approaching the event horizon of a black hole.  I have seen this explained several places, including a brief explanation in the last paragraph under: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole#General_relativity"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole#General_relativity</a>, quoted below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oppenheimer and his co-authors interpreted the singularity at the boundary of the Schwarzschild radius as indicating that this was the boundary of a bubble in which time stopped. This is a valid point of view for external observers, but not for infalling observers. Because of this property, the collapsed stars were called ""frozen stars"",[17] because an outside observer  would see the surface of the star frozen in time at the instant where its collapse takes it inside the Schwarzschild radius.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this mean then that no matter actually falls into a black hole (except possibly what was there at its formation)?  Would this also mean matter is accumulating just outside its event horizon?  As I understand it, this would be the perspective from outside the black hole.  If this is the case, I wonder if we would observe a tremendous amount of matter surrounding the event horizon, but it would be extremely red shifted?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>I noticed an answer to a different question, especially the end portion, provides some insight here as well:

Do satellites travel in groups,"<p>I’m new to this site after googling “do satellites travel in groups”. I read the discussion with posts from 2016 and 2019 and their descriptions did match what we (my wife and I) just witnessed minutes ago.
 I live in Dalhart Texas. We saw the event within 1 hour of sunset. We witnessed at least 15 objects but there could have been many more before we first saw them.
 As the previous comments stated, the objects we saw were also moving NW to SE. No blinking lights, no tell tale red or green lights. Solid light just like countless satellites I have seen before. Same steady pace but all in synchronized direction and speed. Not all were evenly spaced though. As they traveled SE they all slowly dimmed and disappeared all the same point in the sky. This must be the point at which the suns rays no longer reached the “satellites”. These objects appeared in the same relation to the moon as mentioned in a previous comment on this thread. 
 I’m a bit suprised there are so few related sightings posted here. If these “satellites” orbit the earth then there must be countless sightings.

Theory on why Venus rotates differently to the other planets,"<p>When a body A orbits a body B and both bodies are rotating, gravitational friction will gradually slow down the rotation of the bodies over time and eventually tidally lock them. The effect will of course be more significant on the smaller body. This theory explains why the smaller moons in the solar system are in synchronous orbit about their planets. Also Mercury has a very slow rotation. </p>

<p>I wonder has Venus been slowed down by this process and by some kind of ''rotational inertia'' it reached synchronous orbit and the rotational momentum carried through to a reverse rotation.

Two parallel lines of stars,"<p>I’m in New Zealand and have just seen two lines of uniform stars in parallel lines moving slowly from east and disappearing into nothing right above us. They went on for nearly two minutes before the last one vanished and were not like the star link satellites that move in one tight line from horizon to horizon, they were more spaced out and coming from far off and disappearing into somewhere above us. Also it looked like a shooting star came out of the line and one of the stars was them missing from the uniform lines. Any ideas? Thanks </p>

<p>In 2008, using the Very Large Array (VLA), produced a radio solution of 5.07±1.10 mas, equaling a distance of 197±45 pc or 643±146 ly.<sup>83</sup> As the researcher, Harper, points out: &quot;The revised Hipparcos parallax leads to a larger distance (152±20 pc) than the original; <strong>however, the astrometric solution still requires a significant cosmic noise of 2.4 mas</strong>. Given these results it is clear that the Hipparcos data still contain systematic errors of unknown origin.&quot; Although the radio data also have systematic errors, the Harper solution combines the datasets in the hope of mitigating such errors.<sup>83</sup> An updated result from further observations with ALMA and e-Merlin gives a parallax of 4.51±0.8 mas and a distance of 222 (+34/−48) pc.[10] Further observations have resulted in a slightly revised parallax of 4.51±0.80.<sup>10</sup></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Looking at section 3.1 of Harper et al. (2008):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As discussed in Section 1, Betelgeuse required a significant additional error source (cosmic noise) to obtained the expected χ2. The actual nature of this cosmic noise is not known but it may be related to photocenter movement which is unlikely to be random in position on short timescales and would likely provide a systematic error in the astrometric solution. The position angle of the star's rotation axis has been measured from spatially resolved ultraviolet Hubble Space Telescope spectra. Uitenbroek et al. (1998) found ~55° (measured East of North) from absorption features in Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph data, and Harper &amp; Brown (2006) found ~65° from emission features in multi-epoch Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph data. The distribution of photocenters, perhaps driven by convective and Coriolis terms, may have a special relation to the rotation axis. The stellar proper motion vector also has a position angle of 68° and brightness fluctuations that occurred preferentially near the stellar equator might induce scatter in the parallax displacements, although fluctuations due to stellar rotation itself, would be unlikely because of the ~17 yr rotational period (Uitenbroek et al. 1998).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I understand correctly; the problem with measuring Betelgeuse's position accurately is that it is so large and non-uniform that its &quot;photocenter&quot; (radio, optical, or otherwise) can be significantly different than its center of mass.</p>
<p>And the problem with obtaining accurate parallax determinations is that its non-uniformity <em>changes on timescales comparable to a year</em>. If it were much faster or much slower, it would not be so much of a challenge.</p>
<p>Interferometric <em>optical</em> imaging of Betelgeuse confirm dramatic non-uniformity across its disk.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What will it finally take to accurately measure the distance to Betelgeuse?</p>

Is it even possible to do so?</p>
",36945,15-07-2020 06:29,How to calculate the temperature of a star,"<p>I need a way to calculate the effective temperature (surface temperature) of a star for a stellar model. I need something in the form Te=....</p>

<p>I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Radius in m</li>
<li>mass in kg</li>
<li>the composition of particles (eg H 90%, He 8% etc)</li>
<li>the combined stored thermal energy of the body in J </li>
</ul>

<p>Constants (any really but I'm using these for now):</p>

<ul>
<li>G=gravity constant=6.67408E-011</li>
<li>k=kbolzmann=1.3806485279E-023</li>
<li>s=sbolzmann=5,67036713E-008</li>
<li>PI=pi ~3.14...</li>
</ul>

<p>Example of the sun:</p>

<ul>
<li>mp=average mass of a particle=1,7E-027</li>
<li>M=total mass of the body=2E30</li>
<li>r=radius of the body=700000000</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm using this equation to estimate the core temperature :</p>

<p><code>(G*mp*M)/(r*(3/2)*k)</code> </p>

<p>which nets 15653011 for the sun which is close enough given that that is the only star core temperature known (afaik).</p>

<p>I'm using this to estimate the luminosity L:</p>

<p><code>4*PI*(r^2)*s*(Te^4)</code> </p>

<p>which results in an error of ~1-5%  with 90% of my sample stars which is close enough. For the sun this results in <code>3,95120075975041E+026 W</code> which is only <code>2,7%</code> off.</p>

<p>The problem is I need Te for the 2nd formula which I don't have in my scenario.</p>

<p>Due to the formula for L being dependent on the surface temperature to the power of 4 this value has to be relatively precise.</p>

<p>Assumptions of my model:</p>

<ul>
<li>uniform distribution of particles: so every slice of the body has the same composition as the entire body.</li>

"Spotted fast, VERY bright, moving object in the sky tonight in Gex, France","<p>Tonight around midnight, I spotted a very bright moving object in the sky. Confused and intrigued with my sighting, I decided to go on google to find some answers. It clearly was not a plane as it was far to bright and did not flash. It was not a shooting star as it was not as fast and moved for around 1 minute in the sky before disappearing. I firmly believe it was not a satellite as it was, again, really too bright (and I had spotted 3 other satellites prior to this, it really did not compare). After searching around on various forums describing similar sightings, many people suggested it could have b ISS. However, after checking it’s location today (July 24-25 (23:59-00:00) it was over Australia, meaning I would not have been able to see it.</p>
<p>I even checked websites regarding possibilities that it may have been Jupiter, Saturn or even Mars as they a notorious for being particularly bright during the July-August period. However, pardon my lack of astronomy knowledge, I assume they would not be moving at such a high speeds. I also checked a star map showing their locations, at this moment in time they are facing south and the object I spotted was facing east.</p>
<p>This leads me to my final point. The only evidence I found online which resembles my sighting was similar to this mans sighting in his video: (<a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3410791/What-bright-object-flying-sky-Man-claims-filmed-UFO-Florida.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3410791/What-bright-object-flying-sky-Man-claims-filmed-UFO-Florida.html</a>)</p>
<p>However, when I spotted “this” object, it was not at all green but a bright, white light. He also refers to his sighting as a ‘UFO’ and I personally don’t believe in aliens hovering around earth in little spaceships.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea what it could have been? I am very curious about this now.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>*edit: to the kind stranger who suggested the other forum post as a possible solution (Star like light moving in the sky, what could it be?

After a little while, of staring up, I saw what looked like a star moving. It moved fast, but not a long distance, and various directions and back. It was about the same size of the other stars near by. It was not as bright as other stars though. I stopped looking up for a little bit, to make sure my eyes were seeing things correctly. But then I looked up again I continued to see the light moving. I thought I was going crazy, so I pointed it out to my friend. It took him a little while, but after a few minutes he also saw it. His girlfriend also saw it a few minutes later. My friend brought up something about satellite reflections and other theories, but we have no idea what we saw.</p>

<p>However, assuming I didn't screw up, the distance between two sun-massed objects required to generate 1,000N of force between them is an <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sqrt%28%28G+*+%28mass+of+sun%29%5E2%29%2F%281000+newton%29%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">incredible 54.3 million ly</a>.

Given these results it is clear that the Hipparcos data still contain systematic errors of unknown origin.&quot; Although the radio data also have systematic errors, the Harper solution combines the datasets in the hope of mitigating such errors.<sup>83</sup> An updated result from further observations with ALMA and e-Merlin gives a parallax of 4.51±0.8 mas and a distance of 222 (+34/−48) pc.[10] Further observations have resulted in a slightly revised parallax of 4.51±0.80.<sup>10</sup></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Looking at section 3.1 of Harper et al. (2008):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As discussed in Section 1, Betelgeuse required a significant additional error source (cosmic noise) to obtained the expected χ2. The actual nature of this cosmic noise is not known but it may be related to photocenter movement which is unlikely to be random in position on short timescales and would likely provide a systematic error in the astrometric solution. The position angle of the star's rotation axis has been measured from spatially resolved ultraviolet Hubble Space Telescope spectra. Uitenbroek et al. (1998) found ~55° (measured East of North) from absorption features in Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph data, and Harper &amp; Brown (2006) found ~65° from emission features in multi-epoch Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph data. The distribution of photocenters, perhaps driven by convective and Coriolis terms, may have a special relation to the rotation axis. The stellar proper motion vector also has a position angle of 68° and brightness fluctuations that occurred preferentially near the stellar equator might induce scatter in the parallax displacements, although fluctuations due to stellar rotation itself, would be unlikely because of the ~17 yr rotational period (Uitenbroek et al. 1998).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I understand correctly; the problem with measuring Betelgeuse's position accurately is that it is so large and non-uniform that its &quot;photocenter&quot; (radio, optical, or otherwise) can be significantly different than its center of mass.</p>
<p>And the problem with obtaining accurate parallax determinations is that its non-uniformity <em>changes on timescales comparable to a year</em>. If it were much faster or much slower, it would not be so much of a challenge.</p>
<p>Interferometric <em>optical</em> imaging of Betelgeuse confirm dramatic non-uniformity across its disk.</p>

Strange trail left by shooting star,"<p>I saw something really odd last night that I cannot understand.</p>
<p>Last night I got up around 3am to catch a glimpse of the upcoming Perseids meteor shower, now I know it's not peaking until next week but we have clear skies so I thought I'd take a look. I've seen hundreds of meteor showers, so know what to expect.</p>
<p>Whilst looking at another part of the sky a large shooting star radiated from the Perseus constellation, I just missed it! However, what was left in the sky was most odd, a <em>really</em> long dotted line of what looked like dust trail from the meteor. Usually, these trails stay where there are, and slowly fade away. But this trail didn't fade and very slowly moved across night the sky in an absolutely <em>perfectly</em> straight line until it faded into the horizon.</p>

Why are quasars so far away that they couldn't be optically resolved in the 1950's?,"<p>Wikipedia's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Quasar</a> includes the following in its introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term quasar originated as a contraction of quasi-stellar (star-like) radio source, because quasars were first identified during the 1950s as sources of radio-wave emission of unknown physical origin, and when identified in photographic images at visible wavelengths they resembled faint star-like points of light. High-resolution images of quasars, particularly from the Hubble Space Telescope, have demonstrated that quasars occur in the centers of galaxies, and that some host-galaxies are strongly interacting or merging galaxies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So today instead of &quot;quasi-stellar&quot; we might simply say &quot;unresolved&quot;. <s>The light is star-like because the light from galaxies has a strong stellar component.</s> (this second sentence is argued against in comments)</p>
<p>Why are quasars so far away that they required high resolution techniques (i.e. space telescopes or adaptive optics) to resolve them? Is it just that they are fairly rare and a roll of the dice resulted in none close enough to be resolved in older large telescopes of the 1950's, or are there some cosmological effects in play as well?</p>

It exists as well and has much significance for (extrasolar) planets on near orbits — but this question is not about tides on Sun. Ī̲’d accept an answer assuming gravity of the Sun to be spherically symmetric, neglecting Sun’s deviation from spherical symmetry, as well as rotation (even going to account for General Relativity). The solar tide is <strong>interaction between this gravity and the orbiting object.</strong> By Newton’s laws, gravitation affects Sun’s momentum reciprocally (and, hence, velocity), and we may ignore here any effect on Sun beyond its translational motion (momentum/velocity/position).</p>

What is a good way to start learning Astrophysics,"<p>I am a junior in high school and throughout my life I have always had a fascination with space. I use to watch ""Space's Deepest secrets"" and stuff like that but after a while I stopped learning much and became bored. Then I took an astronomy class in sophomore year which was fun until it ended. After that there wasn't much for me to do, but now I want to go from the beginning to the end. I want to learn and everything I can all over again, but this time I want to go farther. This is where my problem comes from, I have absolutely no idea where to start and would really appreciate any help that could be given.</p>

And I'm completing my collection of applications of my studies. During previous year I started reading about Robotics and Coding theory (but in free times as a hobby). I knew that my field of study has application in Astrophysics but I didn't have enough time to go after this topic as well. But my main question; these days I felt into mood of having a general knowledge in Astronomy etc. everything related to stars and space.</p>

<p>As I'm not seeking the application of my field of study at astrophysics (if I were it was better to put this question at math stack instead of hear) and certainly almost all members here are not familiar with pure mathematics, I will be pleased if someone here introduce one or several nice texts or books which satisfy one of the two following set of conditions:
1- Some elementary sources which people who doesn't have any background can read them. The notes be exciting and the reader wants to continue it until its end.
2- Sources which also use mathematics (specially if the level of the math won't be only some calculus) but the dominant text be about stars and space.</p>

<p>Assume you are suggesting a text to a person as his first thing he will read in this topic. And if you think a series or a number of texts are suitable, please give an order to which should be read first and then which for the next and so on.
(Also please note that I don't like to read guesses! So texts contains we guessed x should be because of y or we think the world is ... are not interesting to me)</p>

  <p>If we calculate the orbit of Mercury using Newtonian gravity then in fact we find it does precess. This precession is caused by interactions with the other planets. But when you calculate the precession using Newtonian gravity you find it gives a value that is too low.

Why does the transit method work so well for planet hunting?,"<p>This may seem like a duplicate of <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/28423/a-few-questions-regarding-the-transit-of-planets"">A few questions regarding the transit of planets</a> and <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/28554/orbital-plane-evolution-and-planet-discovery-via-transit-method"">Orbital plane evolution and planet discovery via transit method</a>, but...</p>

<p>How is it that we've been able to discover so many exoplanets via the transit method when it's so rare to see transits of Venus and Mercury across our own Sun? The orbits of all the major planets of our solar system are very nearly co-planar, and yet most Sun-Mercury-Earth or Sun-Venus-Earth alignments don't result in a transit visible from Earth. For any given star/exoplanet, there is a limited region of space from which a transit could be observed. How is it that we happen to fall into such a region for so many exoplanets, thus allowing for their discovery? </p>

<p>If orbital orientation is purely random, we could expect only a tiny fraction of exoplanets to be discoverable via the transit method. If most planetary systems have orbital axes more-or-less parallel with each other (and presumably with the galaxy itself), then we could only find exoplanets via transit by looking out more-or-less along the plane of our own orbit, and again, not necessarily finding a large fraction of the systems that actually exist (all those stars above or below the ecliptic).</p>

<p>Here's the thing though: out of all possible edge-on configurations, there are far more configurations where a planet can never be in the position to be edge-on, rather than configurations where a planet could potentially be in the position to be edge on.

I mean, isn't true that <span class=""math-container"">$c$</span> remains constant in the two-body problem (being <span class=""math-container"">$c = \vec{r}\times \dot{\vec{r}}$</span>)?

Is our Universe inside a black hole?,"<p>Could the known universe be inside a black hole and it's curvature really be the event horizon of the black hole?</p>
",31740,02-05-2019 16:02,Is our universe included inside a black hole?,"<p>This question repetitively comes to my mind but I've never found any good scientist article to argue about it, only esoteric or speculative web articles without much valuable background.</p>

<p>So let's suppose we're in the middle of a ""black hole"" ...</p>

<p>To me, here is why this would make sense:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Big bang</strong></p>

<p>The word big bang itself may be inapproriate, indeed it is said to be an ""explosion"" but an ""explosion"" without any center.  </p>

<p>With the idea of being inside a black-hole, it is easier to represent this as being the matter entering the black-hole. From our position, and as we are attracted by the singularity, everything seems to expand wherever we look at. And as far as we can look at, we can only see the cosmic background radiation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dark matter</strong></p>

<p>On the contrary of matter entering the black-hole, dark matter is the matter already in front of us and we'll never be able to access it as its light (i.e. information) cannot go backward within the singularity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Time/Gravitation</strong></p>

<p>Time is a dimension like any other and as we feel x,y,z dimensions as a field of view, we fell time as an irrepressible attraction toward the singularity. Gravity may be see also as a less irrepressible dimension (depending on mass around).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other black holes</strong></p>

<p>Other black-hole we ""see"" may let us envision the shape of the universe not as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-torus_model_of_the_universe"" rel=""noreferrer"">simple torus</a>, but higher dimensional ""toric"" shape with ""connections"" everywhere (maybe shapes like high order <a href=""http://csi.chemie.tu-darmstadt.de/ak/immel/tutorials/orbitals/hydrogenic.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">atomic orbitals</a> ?).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Is there any reasonable scientific background to argue/contradict about this ?</p>

<p>the Sun is traveling approximately in the ecliptic plane.
However, the ecliptic plane is steeply inclined to the galactic plane, so if this drawing is correct (from voyager.jpl.nasa.gov) then this would mean the plane of the Sun's orbit around the galactic center is also quite inclined.
And thus my question, what is the distance to the galactic plane, are we heading toward/away from it, and what is the inclination of the orbital plane of our Sun/solar system to the galactic plane? 3 questions I guess.</p>

Explanation of Longitude of Periapsis,"<p>I'm looking for a mathematical justification of the <strong>longitude of periapsis</strong> as it makes no mathematical sense to me as a notion. By definition, it is the sum of the argument of periapsis and the longitude of the ascending node, each of which makes sense on their own.  I understand these latter two notions geometrically. But I don't know what the longitude of periapsis is supposed to represent.  The longitude of the ascending node is an actual angle measured within the ecliptic, while the argument of periapsis is an actual angle measured within the given bodies orbital plane.  These two planes are skewed with respect to one another by an inclination angle.  Thus, you cannot mathematically just add the two angles together; it geometrically has no representation.

How can heavy elements exist when the universe is young compared to the lifetime of a star?,"<p>Our sun is said to be incapable of producing heavier elements, and these are thought to originate from older stars dying and going supernova. If our sun is 4-5 billion years old, and has a lifetime of 10 billion years, how could an earlier sun have lived and died in the short time between the creation of the universe and the birth of our fine solar system?</p>
",26852,03-07-2018 00:54,"How can there be 1,000 stellar ancestors before our Sun?","<p>I've heard from a few sources<sup>*</sup> recently that the Sun is a 1,000th generation star, meaning it had a thousand stars that came before it based on its heavy-element content.</p>

<p>I understand that earlier stars' supernovae created the heavier elements and those were incorporated into the Sun when it formed and we can calculate the generation based on that. </p>

<p>My question is based on the age of the universe and the age of the Sun and the average age of stars in the galaxy.</p>

<p>Basically, the universe is ~13.7 billion years old, the sun is ~4.6 billion years old (and has ~5 billion years of life left), which means it was formed when the universe was ~9.1 billion years old.</p>

<p>For 1,000 stars to live in that span of time, those stars would have to have an average lifespan of ~9 million years (not including time between stars). This equates to each of those thousand stars having an average mass of ~100-150 solar masses so their lives would be sufficiently short to not go over that ~9 million-year lifetime.</p>

<p>So basically, there were 1,000 stars that lived and died before our Sun, all of which were huge monsters. This just all seems so improbable. How can this be?</p>

How can you estimate distance of an object by its redshift?,"<p>Is there a way to take the red shift of an object and, from that, calculate a rough estimate of its distance from us (in parsecs, preferably)?</p>
",26406,25-05-2018 18:41,"Approximate conversion of redshift 'z' to a time and/or distance, when reading papers?","<p>I'm looking for some form of ""rough and ready"" formula to convert between redshift <em>z</em> value, years since BB, and distance, so that when I read an astronomy paper and it discusses an event that occurred at z=10+/-0.5, or a quasar at z=7, I can get a rough idea when the event occurred and how far away they are saying the quasar is, as context.</p>

<p>I'm aware that this is an inherently vague question, since the times and distances depend on the model and convention chosen, and also that I'm not specifying proper distances/comoving coordinates, etc.</p>

<p>My assumption is that most current models and their parameters,  that are mainstream accepted and used, will be based on very similar parameters of very similar models (if not the same model), such as latest Planck parameters, or similar. They might differ more due to assumptions about very early times, but redshift is inherently >~380 k years, and if they did vary a lot for times beyond that timeframe, we'd have real issues.   In other words, I suspect/hope that any differences in answers due to model variation, won't significantly change the answer to <em>this</em> question. So the only question will (hopefully) be, which convention or type of metric/distance will be appropriate.</p>

<p>If an assumption needs making (such as the meaning of 'distance' to be applied, or the zero point used for time: BB or end of inflation etc) please make an assumption  most likely to help me, and I'll edit the question to clarify if needed, once I see what is too vague in the question as initially worded.</p>

A similar question was asked <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/14280/why-are-planets-round"">here</a>, which speaks about why objects in the universe are round, which as stated, is due to Gravity.
I understand Gravity is the strongest, most consistent ""force"" in the universe and to traverse it we have to push against it - jets, propulsion, etc.
Never the less, I am perplexed why gravity's forces make objects round - eventually or over time. Why can't it turn a planet into a cube for example? Why can't Gravity make objects flat, and perhaps round at the perimeter?

<blockquote>
  <p>objects that were once close ... are now up to around 45.7 billion
  light years away rather than up to 13.799 billion light years away ...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This reasoning would only make sense if the flat, static <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space"">Minkowski spacetime</a> conception under special relativity were correct.

<p>That doesn't clear the matter up for me, and having no science or maths background beyond high school, further reading into Hubble's law isn't helping much either.</p>

<p>One layman's explanation I've seen offers explanation that the Universe itself isn't bound by the same laws as things <em>within</em> it.

<p>It will be impossible to find it against the dark sky if not for the companion bright slice. What I see basically fills the round, just is smaller as compared to the bright part.</p>

<p>To me, it is reasonable that Earth can illuminate the Moon, however I am not sure. Moreover, the ""Earth phase"" as seen by the Moon should be crucial here. If I am right, this might explain why sometimes I see the above phenomenon but more often I don't.</p>

I was looking out my window and spotted a bright orange light moving at a steady speed across the sky, it was definitely not a star, at first I thought it was maybe a plane and one of its engines was on fire but it was moving too fast to be a plane and it didn't appear to lose any speed or height as you might expect in that situation. Then I though it could be a landing plane since I live near an airport, again the same conclusion. I watched this bright orange light fly across the sky and occasionally dim as it went behind a cloud although it was still visible. It came out the first cloud and wntered the second, however when it came out of the second cloud it had changed into several dim red lights in a flat line, with the accasional bright flash of green to replace the red lights. It continued to fly over the airport and eventually got too far away to see anymore.

I saw a light moving fast what could it be?,"<p>Today, at about 23:40 in Sungkyungwan University, South Korea, a friend and I spotted a bright light. </p>

<p>It was brighter than nearby stars. Since I was looking at South, and at that time, the brightest star in the Southern sky was Saturn, with an apparent magnitude of about 0.9, I'm safely assuming that its apparent magnitude was brighter than 0.9. The thing was even brighter than that (I think that it was as bright as a full moon).</p>

<p>Its initial altitude was about 60degrees then it fell below the horizon very quickly (in about 3~4 seconds). At first, I thought that it was a comet of some kind, but It wasn`t leaving any traces in the sky, and also it was moving in sort of a random way, going from left to right to left to right and so on. </p>

<p>It was a point, but it was so bright that it appeared larger than Vega(I'm not talking about absolute sizes, as stars don't have sizes. I'm just saying that, just as brighter stars seem larger, this moving thing was brighter and therefore, seemed larger.)</p>

<p>My friend and I saw it together, and wondered what it was. </p>

<p>Then, after about 10 minutes, it appeared again. But this time, it came from the place where it disappeared at its first sight. It moved up to about 10degrees (altitude). When it was going up, it was going up in a parabolic path. Then, it came down but along the way, its path changed from parabola to zig zag. Going from up to down took about 2 seconds. </p>

<p>What could this be? This cannot have been an optical illusion because both my friend and I witnessed it. Also, it could not have been a satellite as it was too bright(almost as bright as the moon) and moved in a non-linear path (also it moved very very fast). </p>

",21028,15-05-2017 16:56,"How large (that is, radius) could a planet be?","<p>I know that normal planets don't get any larger than Jupiter (or 2 Jupiter radii if hot), as adding more gas just increases density, not radius, until you reach the point of being a brown dwarf star.</p>

<p>That compressability, I suppose, is a property of the overall average material that forms star systems, as beyond a critical size it accretes the ambiant gas as well as dust in the cloud.  That is, it's mostly hydrogen and a quarter helium with a bit of other stuff.</p>

<p>But what about a body made of other stuff, such as rock or metal? Without worrying about planetary formation processes, just that atoms are piled together and feel self gravity.

<p>Is it positive or negative? Since it is considered as mass only, it should decrease expansion somehow. Am I right about this?</p>
",20952,06-05-2017 17:37,How does light affect the universe?,"<p>When light is emitted by for example a star, that star loses energy - which causes it to reduce its gravity. Then that energy begins a journey for potentially billions of years, until it reaches some other object.</p>

<p>When that light reaches a surface, such as another star or galaxy, it will give that energy to the destination star in the form of heat. This causes the receiver to increase its energy, in turn restoring a sort of balance. It also causes the receiver to emit a minute amount of more light again, almost like a reflection.</p>

<p>It will also excert pressure on the receiving surface once it reaches its destination, be it a star, a rock or anything else.</p>

<p>But while that light is travelling through space, its energy is ""unavailable"" to the rest of the universe. Naturally I ask the following question: </p>

<p><strong>Will light cause gravity, while it is traveling?</strong></p>

<p>Every single star emits light in every direction, and will eventually reach every other star in the universe. At any single point in the universe, there must be a continous ray of light coming from every single other star in the universe, that has a direct path to that point. Given that all stars on the sky is sending photons that reaches every square centimeter of the earth surface, the amount of pressure should sum up to be quite large.</p>

<p><strong>Is the amount of pressure really neglible, given that every single atom on any surface is receiving light from every single lightsource on the sky?</strong></p>

<p>Based on a calculation found at <a href=""http://solar-center.stanford.edu/FAQ/Qshrink.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://solar-center.stanford.edu/FAQ/Qshrink.html</a> the sun will during its lifetime emit 0.034 % of its total mass as energy. Assuming the sun is average, and that there are about 10^24 stars in the universe, and all of these stars on average are half way through their lifetime, there should be energy amounting to the gravity of about 1.7*10^22 suns distributed throughout the universe.</p>

",17858,09-08-2016 11:16,Are many exoplanets synchronously tidally locked like Mercury?,"<p>The only tidally locked planet in the Solar system is Mercury. But it is synchronously tidally locked 3:2, because of the relatively high eccentricity of its orbit, so doesn't turn the same side towards the Sun. I wonder if this is common for exoplanets?</p>

<p>Many discovered exoplanets are close to their star and must be tidally locked. Has any of them been determined to be synchronously tidally locked, like Mercury? Is Mercury a rare freak in this respect, or a representant of a common phenomenon?</p>

Is it Jupiter Only a Gas Giant?,"<p>i heard &amp; saw in website &amp; you tube most of the people saying that i Jupiter planet made of Gas..i like to know if we some how went to Jupiter &amp; land a Space Ship cant we find a Hard Land with soil.</p>
",16797,03-08-2016 12:01,What will happen when landing on Jupiter?,"<p>Jupiter is a gas giant, so landing on it will not be like landing on Earth, our Moon or Mars etc., as it <strong>does not</strong> have a <em>solid</em> surface like these.</p>

<p>If we have a hypothetical spaceship or probe landing on Jupiter, and it can withstand the enormous pressure, what or how will be the sequence of events?</p>

<p>I already read <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_of_Jupiter"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A major problem in sending space probes to Jupiter is that the planet
  has no solid surface on which to land, as there is a smooth transition
  between the planet's atmosphere and its fluid interior. Any probes
  descending into the atmosphere are eventually crushed by the immense
  pressures within Jupiter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I do not understand:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this enormous or immense pressure of atmosphere or Jupiter's <em>surface</em>?</li>
<li>While descending, will we know that we have transitioned from the atmosphere to the <em>surface</em>?</li>
<li>Why does animated footage (real or conceptual) of Jupiter appear like a high viscous liquid (e.g. lava) rotating in an opposite direction, rather that gas(es)?</li>
<li>Does Jupiter have an inner solid core?</li>
</ul>

Accretion discs emitting jets,"<p>When there are accretion discs jets of particles or radiations will be emitted in the direction parallel to the rotational axis.</p>

<p>My beginner level astronomy textbook just says that it is due to magnetic field but does not explain why.</p>

<p>So can anyone explain the mechanism in layman's terms? Thanks in advance!</p>
",16791,03-08-2016 05:19,Why do black holes have jets and accretion disks?,"<p>If supermassive black holes possess the gravity required to prevent the escape of photons and other mass particles, why do jets and accretion disks form? </p>

<p>They seem to indicate that something is coming <em>out</em> of the black hole, while mathematics and physics seem to tell us that this is impossible.</p>

<p>It would seem that supermassive black holes only exert gravity towards themselves. </p>
