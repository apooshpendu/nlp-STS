  <p><strong>Popular Science | Are Viruses Alive? New Evidence Says Yes.</strong><br>
  <em>Viruses</em> seem to carry out only one life process, <em>reproduction</em>, but even then, individual <em>viruses</em> don't carry <em><a href=""http://eol.org/info/458?con=&amp;dom=pscau&amp;src=syndication"" rel=""nofollow"">translational machinery</a></em>, namely, the <em>proteins</em> needed to read their <em>DNA</em> and <em>RNA</em> and build new <em>viruses</em>. They invade a <em>cell</em> and hijack its <em>genetic tools</em> to do it for them...<br>
  But within the last decade, <em>developments in virology</em> have started to reveal more and more that <em>viruses might in fact be alive</em>...  </p>
  
  <p>One was the <em><a href=""http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/discovery-of-the-giant-mimivirus-14402410?con=&amp;dom=pscau&amp;src=syndication"" rel=""nofollow"">discovery of mimiviruses</a></em>; <em>giant viruses</em> with large <em>genomic libraries</em> that are even bigger than some <em>bacteria</em>. (To put this in perspective, some <em>viruses</em>, like the <em>Ebola virus</em>, have as few as <em>seven genes</em>.) Some of these <em>giants</em> have <em>genes</em> for the <em>proteins</em> that are required for <em>translation</em>—those <em>readers of DNA and RNA</em> that in turn <em>build new viruses</em>...<br>
  This throws the lack of <em>translational machinery argument</em> for classifying them as nonliving on its head.<br>

  <p><strong>Science Daily | Virus.</strong><br>
  A <em>virus</em> is a microscopic <em>particle</em> that can infect the <em>cells</em> of a biological <em>organism</em>... <br>
  At the most basic level, <em>viruses</em> consist of <em>genetic material</em> contained within a protective <em>protein coat</em> called a <em>capsid</em>; the existence of both <em>genetic material</em> and <em>protein</em> distinguishes them from other <em>virus</em>-like <em>particles</em> such as <em>prions</em> and <em>viroids</em>... <br>
  It has been argued extensively whether <em>viruses</em> are living <em>organisms</em>...  </p>
  
  <p>Most <em>virologists</em> consider them <em>non-living</em>, as they <em>do not</em> meet all the criteria of the <em>generally accepted definition</em> of <em>life</em>...<br>
  They are similar to obligate intracellular <em>parasites</em> as they lack the means for <em>self-reproduction</em> outside a <em>host cell</em>, but unlike <em>parasites</em>, <em>viruses</em> are generally not considered to be true living <em>organisms</em>...<br>
  A primary reason is that <em>viruses</em> do not possess a <em>cell membrane</em> or <em>metabolise</em> on their own - characteristics of all living <em>organisms</em>.<br>

Is this a bedbug or a book lice or what?,"<p>So basically i found this thing in my home. It's super small so I had to zoom it for you. Whiteish/yellowish colour. We had bedbug problem back in our dorms and I'm worried I somehow managed to transfer them home but I don't know if it's a bedbug nymph or a book lice or what kind of insect, so I'd really appreciate someone's opinion on this.</p>

<p>Edit: It's really small, like. really small. my mother wouldn't even see it and thought me crazy. Just zoom made it look bigger. I'd say 1.5mm maximum at the very best. Moves kinda quickly and I thought it jumped two times when i was trying to capturing but maybe it was just me doing it to it. Living in Europe, Slovakia specifically. </p>

Is it possible to genetically alter human beings to see parts of the infrared?,"<p>Most electron transitions take place in the infrared region,The ability to see this part of the electromagnetic spectrum without reliance on sophisticated technology would have tremendous advantages. Is it possible to manipulate human genes to see this part of the spectrum?</p>
",51505,12-09-2016 15:50,Is it possible that by mutation a human could see infrared or other 'colours'?,"<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eUJcv.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eUJcv.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Incoming light reacts with the several types of cone cells in the eye. In humans, there are three types of cones sensitive to three different spectra, resulting in trichromatic color vision. Each individual cone contains pigments composed of opsin apoprotein, which is covalently linked to either 11-cis-hydroretinal or more rarely 11-cis-dehydroretina.</p>

<p>The opsins (photopigments) present in the L and M cones are encoded on the X chromosome.  A very small percentage of women may have an extra type of color receptor because they have different alleles for the gene for the L opsin on each X chromosome. X chromosome inactivation means that only one opsin is expressed in each cone cell, and some women may therefore show a degree of tetrachromatic color vision. Tetrachromacy is also demonstrated among several species of birds, fish, amphibians, reptiles and insects.</p>

<p>Humans cannot see ultraviolet light directly because the lens of the eye blocks most light in the wavelength range of 300–400 nm.</p>

<p>So, besides above mentioned exceptions, is it possible due to mutations or genetic engineering to see UV or infrared. What kind of mutations should be made or are the changes to be made in the opsines to big to create 'alien' eyes?</p>

Are all 23 chromosomes connected as one long strand of DNA?,"<p>This has perpetually confused me. Is our genome made up of two long strands, each strand made up of 23 continuous chromosomes that bind together, or are they 23 free floating separate pair of chromosomes?

<p>If is the latter, is there a convention on how the chromosomes are ordered in genomic datasets?  Also, is there a clear understanding of how sister chromosomes ""find"" each other in Meiosis I?</p>

<p>Generally, during periods when Mitosis/Meiosis are not occurring,  what's a good physical picture for how the chromosomes are physically arranged (e.g. a bowl of 46 spaghetti noodles, or maybe the sister chromosomes always stay close together, etc)</p>

<p>A DNA, is a double chain of Nucleotides (A,T,G,C and a sugar) and a phosphate residue. Some parts of a DNA code a gene and some do not, exons and introns accordingly. As I understand it these the sequences of exons hold genes and the whole sequence is called genome. Now I read in the book Introduction to Computational Molecular Biology by J. C. Setubal and J. Meidanis. that I cite <em>Each cell of an organism has a few very long DNA molecules. Each such molecule is called a chromosome.</em> So each X shaped thing called a chromosome holds one DNA molecule? </p>

<p>Or is each ""hand"" of the chromosome one complete double helix of DNA so we have 23 pairs of such chromosomes? or is it that each we 23 pairs Xs? </p>

<p>Shouldn't we have just one uniquely identifiable DNA sequence? I am asking this, because I have also read that each chromosome <em>encodes</em> a different part of one's genome. Does this mean we have several DNA sequences? </p>

<p>This is really bothering me, since I can't figure out the correct structure of a cell. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong><br>
Now if each chromosome contains a pair of DNA helices. We have 46 chromosomes so overall within the cell there are 92 DNA sequences? All of which are the same? Or are they different? If they are different how do they code for different aspects of one's genome?</p>

Examples of creating a new animal species by humans,"<p>So recently, I was arguing with my friend who happens to be creationist. As he does not believe in the ""theory of evolution"" I asked him how he can explain such a big diversity in the dog Canis familiaris sppecies.

<p>Looking at the genetic code, it appears that most redundancy is on the third letter rather than on the first or the second letter of the codon. <em>Why has it evolved this way?</em></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Longer version</strong></p>

<p>In order to compare the relative redundancy accounted by each letter of the codon, let's assume that that every codon occurs at equal frequency. It is probably wrong but useful for the sake of the calculations. Using observed frequencies of codon usage in a given population would change the following probabilities but the question of why some positions in the codon has more redundancy than some others still hold.</p>

<p>A substitution of the first letter of the codon has a probability of $\frac{1}{2048}≈0.00005$ (Stop codon) to be synonymous. A substitution of the second letter of the codon has a probability $\frac{3}{256}≈0.012$ (nucleobases U and G) to be synonymous. A substitution of the third letter has a probability of exactly $\frac{2}{3}$ to be synonymous.</p>

<p>Probability of a substitution to be synonymous given that it occurred on the...</p>

<li>Third letter: $\frac{2}{3}$</li>

How Can Homosexuality be Genetic?,"<p>I hold no strong opinions towards homosexuality one way or the other; I'll personally refrain, but don't apply my personal tastes to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>I remember seeing some articles a while back, and in some online debates, that there's been evidence in favour of a genetic component of homosexuality. I ignored it back then (before it became legalised), since it didn't affect me. However, after deep thinking, I started to <em>seriously</em> <strong>doubt</strong> those stories.</p>

<p>My gripe is this, based on my <em>extremely</em> limited understanding of Evolutionary Biology, organisms with genes which boost survivability, will tend to become more abundant. Genes that made organisms more fertile and reproduce more, will tend to become more abundant.</p>

<p>So, if say a particular gene, reduced <em>effective</em> fertility of organisms, that gene may be expected to be absent after a while. Fewer organisms with that gene would reproduce each successive new filial generation. There will be a diminishing marginal increase in the population of these gene bearers, before there eventually starts to become negative growth. I expect that population, may eventually find themselves in extinction, or on the brink of it.</p>

<p>In the few 100,000 years that Homo Sapiens have walked this planet, I guess there's been sufficient time for a population of genetically predisposed homosexuals to become extinct, or reach its brink. Certainly not the 5% - 10% estimated population we have today.</p>

<p>As such, I am unable to understand how homosexuality might be determined by genes in spite of natural selection. </p>

<p>My understanding of Evolutionary Biology may be <em>severely</em> lacking; especially as my teachers in the subject believed it was blatantly false, and were not really interested in making their students understand it. Some even going to the extent of making it seem as ridiculous as possible (I live in a country, where more than 90% of the population are genuinely religous (as in they truly believe in the existence of God) in one form or the other). I would appreciate answers to my question.</p>

<p>Of course, whether or not treatment of homosexuals should change, is another separate matter. It certainly does not follow from any conclusion of this inquiry; the answer to this question, is irrelevant as far as LGBT rights are concerned.</p>

Add in the process of culturally modified selection pressure, and it seems to me that even an ""unfit"" male would end up having a couple of offspring. The fittest male (or female) is no better off than his or her contemporaries because of this ""leveling"" effect. </p>

Why do myelinated axons conduct impulses faster?,"<p>How does the myelination help in better conduction? I would prefer answers that are not too technical please.</p>
",57611,24-03-2017 12:12,Why is saltatory conduction in myelinated axons faster than continuous conduction in unmyelinated axons?,"<p>How does spacing apart sodium and potassium channels allow the action potential to travel faster down the axon? This is the reason always cited for saltatory conduction and myelination, but my mental model of conduction tells me that the density of ion gates along the axon should not affect the speed of the AP. </p>

<p>To illustrate, consider a myelinated axon. A wave of Na$^+$ from action potential site 1, a node of Ranvier, rushes into and quickly diffuses down the axon. (It travels in both directions, but backwards is still in the refractory period.) It diffuses through the myelinated region, its concentration always diminishing. Before it attenuates too much, however, it happens upon node of Ranvier 2, where it triggers another action potential. A new wave of Na$^+$ rushes in and the cycle repeats. This should be plain so far.</p>

<p>Now imagine that there is actually a node of Ranvier halfway between node 1 and 2, called node 1.5. The wave of Na$^+$, on its way to node 2, happens to trigger an action potential at node 1.5, from which a wave of Na$^+$ pours in and either boosts the original wave or replaces it by taking its momentum. Now the reinforced wave proceeds to node 2 and triggers it just as soon as, perhaps even sooner than, if node 1.5 had not existed. Repeatedly insert nodes at higher densities until the situation is simply lack of myelination, and we conclude that unmyelinated axons can transmit an action-potential-triggering wave of Na+ as fast as or faster than a myelinated one.</p>

<p>In short, my point of confusion is this: <strong>I cannot see how a higher density of gated channels can possibly slow down the wavefront of Na+ that triggers action potentials.</strong> If anything, the additional influxes of Na+ should speed up the all-important wavefront, assuming that new waves really ""either boost the original wave or replace it by taking its momentum"", and also assuming that the wavefront of Na$^+$ is really all-important for signal transmission, and also assuming that the mere presence of (voltage?) gated ion channels in the membrane does not significantly retard the wavefront.</p>

<p>But the usual explanation for why saltatory conduction is faster than continuous conduction (a fact I hope is empirically and <em>unambiguously</em> established) relies on <strong>the putative slowing effect of ion channels on the signal fore. Please explain this effect in more detail, if it is not a misconception.</strong></p>

Are RNA transcripts always synthesised from the same DNA strand?,"<p>The DNA is read 3'->5' (and RNA synthesized 5'->3'). But due to the DNA strands having to be complementary, it seems to me that the origin can only appear on the correct side of the ORF on one of the strands. And even if it were possible to synthesise RNA from the other strand, due to the directionailty of the strands/RNA the RNA transcript would then code for the protein in reverse. Surely the reverse synthesis of a protein, even if containing all of the same amino acids, would lead to dfferent folding and thus only on eof the proteins is correct?</p>

<p>Now that I am considering the origin, it seems likely to me that the strand on which the origin is dictates which strand acts as the RNA template (perhaps both starnds can, however for a given GENE the RNA is always synthesised from the same strand.</p>

Why a brain's hemisphere controls the opposite side of the body?,"<p>As a physics student with very little understanding of biology, in a course about physics foundations diagnostic techniques I have come up with this question.

Elements that make action potential to conduct quicker?,"<p>The texts, online materials describe the velocity of conduction of action potential depends on axon's length and cross sectional area e.g. short length and large diameter decreases the resistance. Myelin sheath increases the speed of conductivity as well.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wp4Wr.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wp4Wr.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Can someone explain why <strong>chemical synapses</strong> allow quicker conduction than <strong>regular arrangement of sodium fast channels along the axon</strong>? Can regular arrangement of Na channels help in propagation of AP (I guess it's referring to the nodes of Ranvier)? What's the difference between fast sodium channel and a 'normal' sodium channel?</p>

<p>The question is: Of the following, which allows action potentials to conduct quicker?
1. Chemical synapses
2. Regular arrangement of sodium fast channels along the axon
3. Small axon diameter
4. Depolarisation suppression through the majority of the axon's length</p>

<p>I picked 2, but the answer is 1. I want to know the reason behind me being wrong and that being correct. 1 doesn't make sense at all to me. Come to think of it, I see that 4 could be the most relevant.</p>
",58960,26-04-2017 23:57,Why is saltatory conduction in myelinated axons faster than continuous conduction in unmyelinated axons?,"<p>How does spacing apart sodium and potassium channels allow the action potential to travel faster down the axon? This is the reason always cited for saltatory conduction and myelination, but my mental model of conduction tells me that the density of ion gates along the axon should not affect the speed of the AP. </p>

<p>To illustrate, consider a myelinated axon. A wave of Na$^+$ from action potential site 1, a node of Ranvier, rushes into and quickly diffuses down the axon. (It travels in both directions, but backwards is still in the refractory period.) It diffuses through the myelinated region, its concentration always diminishing. Before it attenuates too much, however, it happens upon node of Ranvier 2, where it triggers another action potential. A new wave of Na$^+$ rushes in and the cycle repeats. This should be plain so far.</p>

<p>Now imagine that there is actually a node of Ranvier halfway between node 1 and 2, called node 1.5. The wave of Na$^+$, on its way to node 2, happens to trigger an action potential at node 1.5, from which a wave of Na$^+$ pours in and either boosts the original wave or replaces it by taking its momentum. Now the reinforced wave proceeds to node 2 and triggers it just as soon as, perhaps even sooner than, if node 1.5 had not existed. Repeatedly insert nodes at higher densities until the situation is simply lack of myelination, and we conclude that unmyelinated axons can transmit an action-potential-triggering wave of Na+ as fast as or faster than a myelinated one.</p>

<p>In short, my point of confusion is this: <strong>I cannot see how a higher density of gated channels can possibly slow down the wavefront of Na+ that triggers action potentials.</strong> If anything, the additional influxes of Na+ should speed up the all-important wavefront, assuming that new waves really ""either boost the original wave or replace it by taking its momentum"", and also assuming that the wavefront of Na$^+$ is really all-important for signal transmission, and also assuming that the mere presence of (voltage?) gated ion channels in the membrane does not significantly retard the wavefront.</p>

<p>But the usual explanation for why saltatory conduction is faster than continuous conduction (a fact I hope is empirically and <em>unambiguously</em> established) relies on <strong>the putative slowing effect of ion channels on the signal fore. Please explain this effect in more detail, if it is not a misconception.</strong></p>

How is the first Triceratops born?,"<p>To clarify at first, I have very little knowledge in biology and paleontology so there might be very obvious things I overlook.</p>

<p>According to the evolution theory, there must be a graduate evolution process over millions of years such that the skull and the horns of the Triceratops gradually appear over time. However why there is no fossil record of such ""intermediate"" form between Triceratops and earlier dinosaurs? I mean there must be some intermediate dinosaurs that has a short skull that almost looks like a small mountain on the neck and very short horns. However based on my internet search I can't find any information that confirms existence of such intermediate dinosaurs. </p>

<p>I just want to know is there any such evidence of graduate evolution among paleontologists or the evolution of dinosaurs is still much based on speculation (without firm evidence)?</p>
",65174,23-08-2017 07:01,"Where are the evolutionary ""inbetweeners""?","<p>The problem I've always had with evolution is the actual lack of variation between animals. More specifically, the lack of observable gradual change between species.</p>

<p>Take for example the hammerhead shark. It obviously has a strong connection with a normal shark, but where's the ""half-hammerhead"" shark? Where's the species that only has a SLIGHTLY wider head?</p>

<p>I really doubt that a single mutation on a normal shark resulted in a head shaped like that, it had to happen gradually. Right? As far as I understand, evolution works by random mutation in a child being somehow slightly beneficial to that animal so it get's to live longer and reproduce more, eventually resulting in it's genetic material in dominating the inferior ones before it. But if it was for whatever reason beneficial to have a slightly wider head, why don't all the sharks have slightly wider heads now? On the other hand, if it wasn't beneficial, how come the hammerhead still exists?</p>

<p>Furthermore, I feel like some characteristics of a certain animal can't really have gradual benefits. There's a lizard that shoots blood out of it's eyes. The original ancestor certainly didn't, and I'm sure that if it's child only bled slightly from it's eyes it wouldn't really help if much in life. So for it to actually become beneficial, it seems to me that there had to be a ton of lizards that had a disadvantage of bleeding slightly. In fact, there had to be so many that they evolved even further in the same direction and kept doing that until they bled so much it's an actual benefit (sorry for this turning so gross). So why did the inbetweeners survive long enough to evolve even more, and why did they THEN die out?</p>

Why are there no WINGED flying arachnids?,"<p>There seem to have been no arachnids flying WITH WINGS of any sort at any location or any time in the present or in the fossil record.  Why is this?</p>

<p>Rationale for question :</p>

<p>If the process of evolution can be expected to explore all (or large numbers of) possibilities open for adaptation of any form, why has this never happened for arachnids which have been present on land in large numbers of species and individuals for about as long a time as insects?</p>

<p>Arachnids were among the first air-breathing terrestrial creatures so have had this option available for all this time, with apparently no sign of wings at all.</p>

<p>Winged flight offers major advantages to creatures that have evolved it, and has been evolved independently by many branches of the animal kingdom and apparently over relatively short timescales among those that have done this (e.g. bats have presumably evolved flight since the kT extinction of about 65 MY bp).</p>

<p>Flight is easier for smaller animals such as arachnids, as insects have shown, and insects have also shown that flight for small creatures is possible in oxygen levels at present, and levels have been much higher at times in the past.</p>

<p>N.B. !! We all know about spiders ballooning on silk ! This question is about WINGED flight. Please do not waste any of your time or ours on comments about ballooning ! That does not allow directed purposeful flight as wings do and is not a substitute adequate to account for this absence.</p>

Why do women go through menstruation?,"<p>I do understand that the female has to prepare for possible fertilization and make sure that the egg is of the best quality, so they try to remove aged egga from the uterine.

Cancer and Evolution,"<p>Edit: just to clarify, I am asking what, if anything, the literature says can be gleaned about evolution by studying cancer, especially relating to how multicellularity evolved and the traits used to force cells under control of the organism.  </p>

<p>Most of the original question details I had added were just my own thoughts on the topic.</p>

<hr>

<p>Original question</p>

<p>Is there a sense in which cancer can be considered as a return to the unicellular ""origin"" of a cell?</p>

<p>It has always seemed to me like cancer is almost inevitable by the structure of the cell (its poor ""design"", essentially). The only thing standing in the way are the cellular controls: senescence/apoptosis (e.g. p53 pathway), immunosuppression (e.g. cytotoxic T lymphocytes), telomeres, etc...</p>

<p>So it seems like multi-cellularity did not evolve ""ground-up"", but was instead generated by slowly differentiating the functions of the various cells, while developing ""top-down""controls against errant cellular behaviour.
Thus, cancer, which occurs when these protections fail, is in some sense merely a return to an ancient evolutionary root. </p>

<p>I suppose some arguments against this include the fact that modern cells are <em>vastly</em> different than their ancient ancestors (or even modern archaea/bacteria). 
So the best we can perhaps say is that the core of the cell has been sufficiently preserved (ribosomes are still mostly RNA, are they not? :] ).
Further, it is hard to call some of the ""micro-evolutions"" of cancer (e.g. interleukin-8 production) as returns to primitive behaviour. 
In these cases, I tend to see them as necessary occurrences to remove the ""top-down"" controls, rather than as integral to the destructive out-of-control growth characterizing oncogenesis.
But, debatably, perhaps not all of them are (e.g. extravasation in metastasis).</p>

<p>Obviously this seems very simplistic, but is there any literature thinking about it this way? Or directly debunking it?</p>
",66037,20-09-2017 05:16,Could cancer be in itself a evolutionary process?,"<p>Could cancer be in itself a evolutionary process? Maybe in some way could it be a process of variation? Or would this idea be completely without support, if so, why? </p>

<p>Could it be possible that in rare cases it could lead to the development of new organs or specialized cells?</p>

",68624,07-12-2017 13:28,Why is saltatory conduction in myelinated axons faster than continuous conduction in unmyelinated axons?,"<p>How does spacing apart sodium and potassium channels allow the action potential to travel faster down the axon? This is the reason always cited for saltatory conduction and myelination, but my mental model of conduction tells me that the density of ion gates along the axon should not affect the speed of the AP. </p>

<p>To illustrate, consider a myelinated axon. A wave of Na$^+$ from action potential site 1, a node of Ranvier, rushes into and quickly diffuses down the axon. (It travels in both directions, but backwards is still in the refractory period.) It diffuses through the myelinated region, its concentration always diminishing. Before it attenuates too much, however, it happens upon node of Ranvier 2, where it triggers another action potential. A new wave of Na$^+$ rushes in and the cycle repeats. This should be plain so far.</p>

<p>Now imagine that there is actually a node of Ranvier halfway between node 1 and 2, called node 1.5. The wave of Na$^+$, on its way to node 2, happens to trigger an action potential at node 1.5, from which a wave of Na$^+$ pours in and either boosts the original wave or replaces it by taking its momentum. Now the reinforced wave proceeds to node 2 and triggers it just as soon as, perhaps even sooner than, if node 1.5 had not existed. Repeatedly insert nodes at higher densities until the situation is simply lack of myelination, and we conclude that unmyelinated axons can transmit an action-potential-triggering wave of Na+ as fast as or faster than a myelinated one.</p>

<p>In short, my point of confusion is this: <strong>I cannot see how a higher density of gated channels can possibly slow down the wavefront of Na+ that triggers action potentials.</strong> If anything, the additional influxes of Na+ should speed up the all-important wavefront, assuming that new waves really ""either boost the original wave or replace it by taking its momentum"", and also assuming that the wavefront of Na$^+$ is really all-important for signal transmission, and also assuming that the mere presence of (voltage?) gated ion channels in the membrane does not significantly retard the wavefront.</p>

<p>But the usual explanation for why saltatory conduction is faster than continuous conduction (a fact I hope is empirically and <em>unambiguously</em> established) relies on <strong>the putative slowing effect of ion channels on the signal fore. Please explain this effect in more detail, if it is not a misconception.</strong></p>

How do photoreceptors overcome the ambiguity of wavelength vs intensity to determine brightness?,"<p>I asked a similar question about the Principle of Univariance yesterday, but now I have another one.</p>

<p>According to the Principle of Univariance, the input to a photoreceptor differs along two dimensions (wavelength and intensity) but the output can only vary along one dimension (the cell's graded potential).</p>

<p>This means that there is inherent ambiguity in the output of the photoreceptor. What I do not understand then is <strong>how it is possible for a rod (or cone) to <em>ever</em> distinguish between intensities (or wavelengths) when each photopigment can absorb a range of wavelengths at different probabilities.</strong></p>

<p>For example, say a rod cell absorbs $50\%$ of all photons at wavelength $x$ and $25\%$ at wavelength $y$.
If 100 photons reach the rod cell at wavelength $x$ we can roughly assume that $100*0.5=50$ isomerizations will occur. Equally, if 200 photons reach the rod cell at wavelength $y$ then we can roughly assume that $200*0.25=50$ isomerizations will <em>also</em> occur. <strong>From the perspective of the cell's synaptic activity, the two responses will be the same despite the large difference in intensity.</strong></p>

<p>Clearly there are an infinite number of permutations to this basic pattern. It is thus unclear to me how the visual system is able to obtain any information about the intensity of light in rod cells.</p>

<p>The same issue also appears present to me in cone cells (the usual explanation is that the relative amount of excitation/inhibition can be compared between cone cells, but this does not seem to solve my overall question).</p>
",68823,15-12-2017 11:45,How do our eyes detect light at different frequencies?,"<p>Here is my confusion: we can see colored light of different wavelengths: form red to violet. To my understanding, these stimuli cause a confirmational change in the photoreceptors in our eyes and results in a STP that eventually leads to an ""all or nothing"" action potential that sends another signal, again an all or nothing action potential through the optic chiasm to the occipital lobe and we perceive the colors as we see them. </p>

<p>My question is <strong>*how does this signaling work? *</strong>; How can a minor stimulus, resulting in an ""all or nothing"" chain of action potentials be converted into something as specific as the vision of color? </p>

<p><strong><em>Asked another way, how does variation in a confirmational change at a receptor that results in ""all or nothing"" signaling lead to specific signals being sent such as colored vision ?</em></strong></p>

Why do universal recipients (AB blood group) not react to antibodies in the blood of O-group donors?,"<p>While studying compatible blood groups, I found that we only consider the antigens on red blood cells (RBCs) and not the antibodies present in blood plasma. For example </p>

<p>The answer to my question is: The similarity is between 98.4%-99.9%, depending on which type of differences you include. The numbers relate to writing my and the other person's DNA as a long string, and compare differences (change of letter, missing/inserted letter). The most important differences seem to be SNPs (=difference in a letter in a gene-coding sequence) and account for 0.1% of difference between our 2 DNA's:</p>

</ul>

<p>I have striked out the original question text, because it includes some motivation and interpretation, which seems false.</p>

<p>edit: It was suggested that the question is a duplicate to <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/20038/same-dna-vs-genes"">&quot;Same&quot; DNA vs genes</a> but this might seem not to be the case, as this question just concerns the used metric (compare answer below).</p>

<p><s></p>

<h1><strong>99.9% vs 88%:</strong></h1>

<p>2 person's DNA is 99.9% the same (which goes down to 99% in some sources), e.g. <a href=""http://book.bionumbers.org/how-genetically-similar-are-two-random-people/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://book.bionumbers.org/how-genetically-similar-are-two-random-people/</a></p>

<p>Does this number include differences in copy-number variations and maybe other ?</p>

<p>On the other hand <a href=""https://www.nature.com/scitable/content/global-variation-in-copy-number-in-the-13571"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.nature.com/scitable/content/global-variation-in-copy-number-in-the-13571</a> says that there may be up to 12% of some other differences (I am not sure what those differences mean).</p>

<h1><strong>Question:</strong></h1>

<p>I have been pouring through the internet and books, but have not yet understood to which metric this 99.9% number refers to? (I am a pure mathematician)</p>

<h1><strong>My hypothesis what it means:</strong></h1>

<p>If we look at a 1000 base-pair long snippet of the DNA of person A, then we will find this same snippet somewhere also in person B's DNA, with just one difference in one of the 1000 base pairs.</p>

<p>Now, if the latter is true, then this means that my DNA may still be significantly different than my neighbours, e.g. by containing a different number of repetitions in the non-coding DNA. </p>

<p>Ultimately, my DNA could be only, say, 2% similar instead of 99.9% (depending on the number of different repetitions), if we used as a metric the number of single base changes (including single deletions/insertions), we need to do to go from the DNA of person A to the DNA of person B (assuming we wrote down each other's DNA in one long string). <strong>Question 2: In fact, I would be quite interested to know how much the DNA of two people is similar using this last metric?</strong></s></p>

Gene located on Which strand? Want reference.,"<p><strong>Update:</strong> Initially my question (below) was appropriately marked as duplicate/overlapping  with two other questions; <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/71530/what-direction-is-a-sequence-in-databases-written"">This</a> and <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/69914/terminology-of-the-sequences-of-promoters-in-relation-to-dna-strands"">this</a> ; among them a specific part of an <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/69914/terminology-of-the-sequences-of-promoters-in-relation-to-dna-strands/69947#69947"">answer</a> of the second duplicate/overlap ; appropriately answer my question. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The convention is that in indicating any sequence feature† in a protein-coding gene on double-stranded DNA, a single strand‡ is represented — the one from which the amino sequence could be read using the genetic code (conceptually, with T substituted for U). Like any other nucleic acid sequence§, it is always written in the 5ʹ to 3ʹ direction in the same manner as the mRNA transcribed from it, without this being explicitly stated. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what it does not mention (<strong>but I'm still looking for</strong>); is whether there is a standard and universal documentation for this particular convention (IUPAC/ IUBMB/ ICBN/ ICZN/ anything such); because <em>""conventions"" are human-made rules</em>, and without ""declared, universally followed, and accessible"" documentation; the conventions does not make a sense.  It rather feels like a rumor or viral phenomenon.  I visited the <a href=""https://iupac.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IUPAC</a> and <a href=""https://iubmb.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IUBMB</a> website home pages but I could not locate the documentation from there. Also google keyword search did not found the helpful. </p>

<p>So I specify my question that I want to get the standard/ official source of this convention. I would be highly grateful if anyone kindly mention the source hyperlink.</p>

<hr>

<p>My Initial Question </p>

<p>I'm stuck at a very basic convention on notation on reading Gene sequence. *Specially when a  book (or question paper or anything) does not mention whether a  nucleic acid (usually DNA), uses a single stranded DNA</p>

<p>The problem appears because similar region of the 2 opposite strands of a DNA can contain different gene, i.e. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FuRgc.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FuRgc.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a> </p>

<p>(So it is possible that if we note a stretch from gene-1 with its complementary sequence, that complementary sequence could be confused with gene-2.) </p>

<p>In some cases, a sequence to a stretch of nucleic acid, indeed mean the sequence directly. </p>

<p>For example; In the wikipedia <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Reading_Frame.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">image</a> about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_frame"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Reading Frame</a> (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reading_frame&amp;oldid=808885688"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Permalink</a>)
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5rra5.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5rra5.png"" alt=""Wikipedia Image""></a> 
the 5'to 3'Left to Right indicates the sequence of the <strong>template strand</strong> directly whereas </p>

<p>But at the more and more ""interior chapters"" I've seen a rather complicated and indirect notation (although I could not found  clear mention of a convention anywhere in books or web)... when they mean a sequence of a stretch of a gene (or a regulatory sequence), they writes the ""nontemplate"" or ""sense-strand"" sequence of the respective gene. </p>

<p>In the Wikipedia <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:TATA_box_description.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">image</a> on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TATA_box"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TATA Transcription Box</a> (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=TATA_box&amp;oldid=839142334"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Permalink</a>); </p>

<strong>it must be a sequence from the nontemplate strand</strong> because if it was the template strand,  the ""Promoter"" location on the ""template"" strand must be on 3' side otherwise RNA polymerase would not be able to synthesize the nontemplate strand mRNA strand from 5' to 3' time-order. <em>But it would become impossible to infer for me if the given sequence lacked labelling for relative locations of promoters and structural genes</em>. </p>

<p>Now my question is If an article  provides me a single stranded  ""Gene Sequence""; How can I infer it is directly the sequence <strong>of</strong> the mentioned gene stretch or it is the complementary (""sense"") strand of the gene? What is the convention about it? </p>

Why do humans enjoy spices?,"<p>It seems that many flavor and food preferences can be explained in the context of regulating feeding behavior. Generally, organisms tend to enjoy those foods which are optimal for them to feed on and provide the best nutrition. There are well-known exceptions to this, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Artificial chemicals (eg. the supposedly sweet-tasting but deadly polyethylene glycol) which are very rare in nature, thus there was no opportunity for an appropriate taste perception to evolve</li>
<li>Nutrients which are desirable in moderation but dangerous in excess (eg. sugar), but have only become readily available recently thanks to technology (thus once again moderated consumption has not had opportunity to evolve)</li>
</ul>

<p>But humans in particular also seem to enjoy consuming a large variety of foods that one would expect to be unpalatable or mildly harmful. For instance various peppers, spices, hot sauces, wasabi, mustard and so forth, don't appear to provide much of a nutritional benefit. Indeed their chief property of interest, the spicy flavor, is a defense mechanism: The plant attempts to make itself unpalatable or toxic to deter predation. Why is it then that this very defense mechanism has ironically become prized as a food ingredient by humans, to such an extent that wars have been fought over access to spices? And why is it that humans do not consider (for instance) pure, fresh, raw meat to be more delicious than meat with seasoning or condiments?</p>

A human lifespan,"<p>Recently, I read an article that said a human lifespan does not have any limit and when a man turns 105 he has a 50/50 chance to survive another year. Some scientists say that a man who will reach the age of 140 has already been born. Is it possible that the length of a human's life will be prolonged over time? I know that we don't know what the limit is and if it exists at all, but it is possible to one day expect it to be completely normal for a human being to live 300 years or so?

",76599,08-08-2018 06:59,What prevents predator overpopulation?,"<p>I've often heard that a population, human or otherwise, will continue to grow as long as there is food available (assuming nothing else is killing them off).  It makes sense: if you have food you can live, and if nothing is hunting you you'll survive to reproduce.</p>

<p>I recently designed a piece of software to simulate an ecosystem, with groups of creatures of different species eating and hunting and reproducing alongside each other.  It was very simplified (each animal had simple attack/defense/speed/stealth values, etc), but something became rapidly apparent: in every simulation the predators overwhelmed the prey, reproducing until their numbers could not be sustained by the herbivores, and leading to an inevitable die-off of both groups.  I could delay the die-off by adjusting different values and initial population counts, but it would always happen eventually.  The predators would eat and breed and eat and breed until the entire system collapsed.</p>

<p>At first I thought it was just the product of my over-simplified system, but it got me thinking: <strong>what prevents predators from overpopulating in real life?</strong></p>

<p>It seems like the natural tendency would be for (for example) the sharks to continue breeding and eating until all the fish are gone, or the wolves to eat all the deer, etc.  Obviously some predators have predators of their own, but that's just putting off the question: if the hyenas don't overpopulate because the lions eat them, then what's keeping the lions from overpopulating?  I can't come up with anything that would prevent the apex predators from growing too numerous, then fighting each other over a dwindling prey population, then dying off entirely when there was no more food to find.</p>

<p>Do predator populations self-regulate to prevent putting undo stress on their prey populations?  Or is there some other mechanism to keep the predator hierarchy from becoming top-heavy?</p>

What are the effects of enzyme exposure to high temperatures?,"<p><strong>Question:</strong> After enzymes are exposed to high temperatures and undergo denaturation, then returned to their optimal temperature and renatured, can the enzyme's active site return to it's original shape and will it function at the same level of efficiency as it did before being denatured and renatured?</p>

<p>Some background I wrote to the question:
I am just beginning to learn Cell Biology, I hope what I've written is correct.</p>

<p>When you raise the temperature of an enzyme, at first it will increase the efficiency of the enzyme's activity, but eventually as the temperature rises, the enzyme with stop functioning and undergo denaturation, which means that the 3D formation of the protein is unraveled, so it doesn't function anymore. From what I've managed to research, the high temperature changes the shape of the active site in the enzyme, which is what allows the enzyme's activity in the first place. 
I know that some proteins cannot be renatured (like adding heat to an egg will fry it and there is no way to unfry it), but some can be renatured (like heated milk, when it cools down the protein bonds will reestablish themselves). </p>

"If post transcriptional modification happens , how can a gene code for amino acids in a particular order?","<p>Post transcription, introns are removed and exons are rearranged randomly. If that's the case (which it is according to the book EDEXCEL SNAB A2 topic 6) then shouldn't the protein produced be different every time? Shouldn't the order of amino acids be different? And if it is, doesn't that mean that the protein produced is different?</p>

<p>To quote : ""When mRNA is produced, its introns are removed by spliceosomes and a different number of exons is put together at different orders which changes the sequence of amino acids in proteins.""</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Genes contain sections that don't code for amino acids. 
  
  <ol start=""2"">
  <li>These sections of DNA are called introns. All the bits that do code for amino acids are called exons. </li>
  <li>During transcription both introns and exons are copied into mRNA. </li>
  <li>The introns are then removed by a process called splicing -- introns are removed and exons joined forming mRNA strands. This takes
  place in the nucleus. </li>
  <li>The exons can be joined together in different orders to form different mRNA strands.</li>
  </ol></li>

At first, I thought it was a piece of lint, but then it suddenly <em>moved</em>. I picked it up in a paper towel and put it in an eye cream containers, which it is currently in. I believe this means that it is pretty strong, since it appeared to have pulled itself all the way up from the floor, to the top of the bed, then across to the other side of a King-sized mattress. </p>

<p>It appears to be a worm wrapped in a cocoon. It is pretty short, being small enough to fit inside an eye cream container.</p>

<p>The creature is a pale yellow-white/cream, with brownish-red tips on each end (unless it can somehow turn around without exiting its casing). It looks from the side as if it has a rather flat face, one that comes to a slight bump at the bottom, but is pretty much flat. The casing is light grey, with some small portions that appear to be almost the same color as the organism, just slightly darker. There is an opening at each end of the casing, which the organism uses to slide slightly out. It has never fully come out of the casing. The edges of the openings at each end are white. The casing seems to either be made out of or covered in dust.</p>

<p>It can create a substance that is sticky and strong enough to support its weight. I cannot tell if the substance is created by the 'worm', or the 'cocoon'. A thread at each end of the casing is connected to the side of the container by the substance. When I accidentally detached one end of the casing, the entire thing began to shake violently when held so that one end was hanging. It wouldn't stop until I had turned it so that both ends were touching the side of the container. Within minutes, though, it had reattached the broken end. <em>Minutes</em>. Not hours, but <em>one minute</em>.</p>

<p>The holes at each end of the cocoon can either grow or shrink closed. I believe this allows us to tell which opening is in use. If it is nearly shut, it will come out the other end.</p>

<p>It appears to be nocturnal, since it doesn't move during the day, but it is very active at night. It also appears to react to light. If some is put on it, it will poke out to look around.  </p>

<p>It has survived for four days straight without food, as far as we know. We put a small piece of lettuce in with it. However, there are two small, brownish things on the bottom of the container. This may be its excrement.</p>

<p>The creature moves by reaching out with its 'tentacle/worm', grabbing onto something (including the ground), and pulling itself forward.</p>

<p>I cannot tell if the creature is attaching to the container's side to climb, or because it is morphing. If that is the case, then the outer shell may be a cocoon. It did detach itself from the side of the container, and first hid under a ledge of lettuce, but now has wrapped itself in lettuce.</p>

<p><strong>To summarize: can someone please help me identify this creature?</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Am I correct to believe that in a single chromosome, one strand of DNA is <strong>not</strong> the template strand for <strong>all</strong> genes within that chromosome?  For instance, let's call one ssDNA molecule ""A"" and the complementary ssDNA molecule ""B""; together, A and B make up a single chromosome.  Am I correct to believe that in a single chromosome, the template strand for some genes will be A, and for other genes will be B?</p></li>
<li><p>If my statement in question #1 is correct, then does that mean that multiple genes within a chromosome can be transcribed in opposite directions?  Note that when I say direction, I do NOT mean 5' to 3' vs 3' to 5'.  What I mean by ""direction"" is looking from left to right.</p></li>
<li><p>Is it true that both strands of the double helix <strong>cannot</strong> be transcribed for a single gene in question?  Is this because the promoter will only be found on one of the strands?</p></li>

</blockquote>

<p>Which, in english, means something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first line repeats the normal wild-type sequence of the 5' flanking region.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The column on the right gives the relative transcription (RT) level, 1.0 being the highest possible level of transcription. As we can see, the lines where some parts of the ""5' region"" have been deleted give quite low RT levels, since some regions of the promoter are missing.</p>

<p><strong>My questions are the following:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> According to <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/54566/on-which-dna-strand-is-tata-box-present"">this</a> and <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14299/on-which-strand-does-the-promoter-sit"">this</a>, I understand that RNA polymerase reads and uses both coding and non-coding strands in order to synthesize RNA. Therefore, how did they manage to use the sequences strands regions had been deleted to make a polymerase ""read them"" and perform transcription?</p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> If the polymerase reads the template strand in the 3' -> 5' sense, shouldn't we talk of ""ATAT box"" or ""TAAC box"" instead of ""TATA"" or ""CAAT"" boxes? Does it mean that the ""promoter"" regions they are using on the graphic above are actually on the coding strand?</p>

Why don't intelligent animals like primates use plastic bags?,"<p>I'll be honest here. Although this is a serious question, what made me wonder about it is this comic from Wumo:<br>

<p>This question is not specific to monkeys. It applies to animals that live with or sufficiently close to human dwellings and would be able to observe our habits daily. I'm not referring to training animals.<br>
Even among animals that have an opposable thumb like ours but different <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/762/why-have-humans-evolved-much-more-quickly-than-other-animals"">HAR regions</a>, the use of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool_use_by_animals"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tools seems to be too primitive</a>. Chimps have been known to re-use tools and even <a href=""https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055768"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cumulative cultural evolution</a> is documented. Whales have been hypothesized to have high intelligence (although <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacean_intelligence#Brain_size"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">not necessarily</a>) due to <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/2948/does-brain-mass-have-any-correlation-to-intelligence"">larger brains</a> containing <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindle_neuron#Function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">more spindle neurons</a>.

<p>So if a chimp can use simple tools, what prevents them from looking at us and imitating our use of something as simple as using a plastic bag or a crude tray to carry a bunch of fruits? Is there a gradation of complexity of tool use that various brains can process? A reason that no matter what happens, a chimp would not be able to imitate our use of tools? Could this be compared to how aged people are unable to learn how to use a smartphone or computer no matter how many times it is explained to them (or even how young people <a href=""https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/12/29/the-perils-of-javaschools-2/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fail to understand pointers and recursion</a>)?

The Viceroy Evolution Paradox,"<p>The viceroy butterfly generates a toxin compound which make it distasteful to predators.  Biologists agree that the viceroy must have developed this trait as a passive defence mechanism to prevent being eaten.</p>

<p>Let’s look at it from an information point of view.</p>

<p>For this to work, information about the bad taste of the viceroy must be known to the predators.  This can happen by a predator eating one viceroy, discovering the bad taste, learning and never doing it again.  Unfortunately, the unpalatable butterfly had to die in the process.</p>

<p>The second, and most important, information path is the genetic one.  One way, evolution work is by the survival of the fittests. In this case the important trait of “tasting bad” dies with the butterfly and is less likely to have been transmitted to a new generation, unless (and this might be part of the answer) we consider the local population of butterfly as the evolving organism.</p>

Maximum recombination frequency,"<p>During the process of crossing over, Why is the maximum possible recombination frequency between two genes equal to 50% and not more than that?</p>
",82476,03-04-2019 15:00,Genetic linkage greater than 50 centimorgans,"<p>Classically, the linkage between two loci can be measured in centimorgans (cM), which represents the percent chance that these two loci will recombine an odd number of times (generating a recombinant genotype).</p>

<p>Due to independent assortment, markers on different chromosomes are expected to recombine 50% of the time. As I understand, if one conducts a classic experiment and counts various progeny, then deduces the apparent linkage, values of 50 cM or more are interpreted as ""<em>impossible to determine whether on separate chromosomes or just recombines very often</em>"". See (<a href=""https://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~mcclean/plsc431/linkage/linkage2.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>), with grammar corrected:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The final point that we need to make regards the maximum distance that we can measure. Because of the way in which the calculations are performed, we can never have more (than) 50% recombinant gametes. Therefore the (maximum) distance that two genes can be apart and still measure that distance is just less (than) 50 cM. If two genes are greater than 50 cM apart, then we can not determine if they reside on the same chromosome or are on different chromosomes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wikipedia gives an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimorgan"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">analytical solution</a> and also remarks that (d is physical distance):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The probability of recombination is approximately d/100 for small values of d and approaches 50% as d goes to infinity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, what happens if the linkage <em>is</em> greater than 50 cM? It seems like classical experiments aside, such a situation is possible in reality.</p>

<p>For instance, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/mapview/maps.cgi?taxid=4932&amp;chr=IV"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">yeast chromosome IV is 1530 kb long</a>, and <a href=""http://www.yeastgenome.org/pgMaps/pgMap.shtml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">averages 0.31 cM/kbp</a>.

<li><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?cmd=retrieve&amp;dopt=full_report&amp;list_uids=852068"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TOM1</a> is at about +1370 kb.</li>
</ul>

<p>The physical distance between these is about 734 kb. According to the cM/kbp value, the centimorgan distance is <span class=""math-container"">$734\text{ kb} \cdot 0.31\text{ cM}/\text{kb} = 228 \text{ cM}$</span> . How to interpret this 228?</p>

<p>If I mate a haploid yeast which is <em>DNF2 TOM1</em> with another which is <em>dnf2 tom1</em> (lowercase indicating minor allele rather than deletion), then sporulate them, what is the chance of getting spores with <em>DNF2 tom1</em> or <em>dnf2 TOM1</em> genotypes?</p>

<p>I realize that the cM/kbp value is only a simplification and that in practice linkage is a more complex phenomenon. Nevertheless, it seems plausible that several crossover events can happen on Chr.IV since it is so big. This includes the possibility of 1, 3, 5 and more crossovers which would create a hybrid (assuming they all happen between these two loci), as well as the possibility of 2, 4, etc crossovers which would create a non-hybrid spore (at least as far as our chosen markers are concerned).</p>

<p>Why is there so little variation in their offspring, unlike humans, where you rarely find two humans showing even a little resemblence.</p>

",85088,21-06-2019 16:23,Why are humans so variable in appearance,"<p>Most animals look almost identical to their peers.

<p>In the case of dogs, we have created many different looking breeds - but within each breed they look the same: one poodle looks very much like the next one.</p>

<p>On the other hand, with humans we have not only the different races (cf. dog breeds), but even within one race no two people are alike. And, not only are the faces different, the body shapes vary equally much. We use face and body shape (and voice) to recognise each other. Most other animals use smell or sound.</p>

<p>I thought the reason for our uniqueness might be that, with civilisation, we are not constrained us to look the same. However, even in hunter-gatherer tribes each person looks different from every other one.</p>

However protein kinase catalyses phosphorylation, while phosphatase catalyses dephosphorylation of the same reaction. Why can't the same enzyme catalyse both directions here? What determines when the enzyme can catalyse a reaction and when they cant?</p>
",87706,13-09-2019 05:47,Examples of enzymes working in reverse?,"<p>I have always been taught that enzymes can catalyze both the forward and reverse reaction, and will increase the reaction rate in both directions. I understand that the thermodynamics of the reaction are not altered by the enzyme, but I have yet to find a good answer / example for an enzyme that actually does this. (E.g. can a nuclease join DNA together if the products are in excess? Can a protease form a peptide bond?) I am having difficulty finding a resource online that actually justifies this claim without just saying ""Yes enzymes work both ways.""</p>

Is there a biological basis for race (re: Nicholas Wade's article),"<p>I just recently read this article by Nicholas Wade on Time Magazine's website about <a href=""http://time.com/91081/what-science-says-about-race-and-genetics/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a biological basis for race</a>.  It all sounded very racist, but of course my Western liberal attitudes about racism shouldn't cloud my stronger Western liberal convictions about Science giving every empirical claim a fair hearing.  </p>

<p>So, that said, where can I learn more about the evidence supporting and contradicting this view?  I found on his Wikipedia page that a number of scientists have condemned his work, but I'd like to actually know the evidence and arguments underneath all this. </p>

<p>I suppose I should also ask more generally about the state of biological evidence for the reality of race.  I had heard in college that there is no biological basis for race, but I'm wondering if that is an out-dated view in light of recent work in genomics.  I read <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2650/is-there-a-consensus-on-whether-or-not-race-exists-on-a-biological-level"">this stack exchange question</a> but it had more to do with whether there is a consensus rather than on the arguments surrounding the issue.</p>
",52165,05-10-2016 08:01,Do humans have enough biological differences to be grouped into races or subspecies?,"<p>After my online research on the subject, I learnt that, biologically speaking, many scientists believe that there is no such thing as a race. <em>Homo sapiens</em> as a species is only 200,000 years old, which has not allowed for any significant genetic diversification yet, and our DNA is 99.99% similar. I've read statements that there can be more genetic variation inside a racial group than between different racial groups, meaning that, for example, two individuals from the same ""race"" can have less in common with each other than with an individual from another ""race"".</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_classification)"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia on Race (human classification) quote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scientists consider biological essentialism obsolete, and generally discourage racial explanations for collective differentiation in both physical and behavioral traits</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><strong>Q1:</strong> If <em>Homo sapiens</em> has no races (according to biologists), why are we so different morphologically? (hair/eyes/skin colour and even athletic performance seem to differ between human populations)</p>

<p><strong>Q2:</strong> Is it common for other species too, when genetically close populations have very different morphological traits? Are there any other mammal or animal species that exhibit biological diversity comparable to human diversity, and how do taxonomists treat these species? (excluding intentionally bred domestic species to keep the comparison fair)</p>

<p><em>The question has been paraphrased to emphasize that it is the <strong>biological</strong> debate that is in question, not the <strong>sociopolitical</strong>. I.e., why is there no consensus in evidence and opinions of scientists?</em></p>

Can undigested food proteins enter the bloodstream?,"<p>I know that food proteins in our digestive system are denaturated and broken down into amino acids or very small peptides that are then absorbed in the small intestine. If some proteins stay undigested they move to the large intestine and either gut flora eats them or they are excreted.</p>

Bacteria in our colons,"<p>During my education in Iran, until now, which I must say that I'm graduating high school this year and will go to college next year, our biology book has said that there's some bacteria in our colons and those little cells live there and use the celloluse of our food and because mostly they are anaerobic they produce methane or hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide and so on and sometimes they are the reason of the smell of our farts. Also they produce little amounts of B and K vitamins which is good for us and also, by using cellulose they make the rejection of feces better and easier. Anyway I wonder that where do these bacterias come from? I mean are they with us since birth? Then it means they come from our mother's body but, wait how our mothers have them? But maybe they are not there since birth and they come to colon from the food we eat during our life, but why don't they die in stomach. Even if we think that they go there by eating food, passing stomach easily, what if we don't eat the ""food that can have those bacteria"", then could it be possible to some humans don't have those bacteria?

In particular:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>While the analyses above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may bind human ACE2 with high affinity, computational analyses predict that the interaction is not ideal and that the RBD sequence is different from those shown in SARS-CoV to be optimal for receptor binding. Thus, the high-affinity binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to human ACE2 is most likely the result of natural selection...</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I interpret this passage as ""if the virus had been engineered, they would have done a better job"". Is this interpretation correct? And if it is, does it sound convincing to you as a proof that the virus developed in nature?</p>

<p>The second motivation given in the article is the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Furthermore, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one of the several reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would probably have been used</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>there is a consensus that the most probable source of the first infection was in an animal market in China.</p></li>
<li><p>since that animal market was actually composed of a plethora of animals belonging to various species (mixed with humans), a virus had a bigger chance of evolving a mutation that might infect an individual from another species (a thing that is way less unlikely in the wild since many of those animals do not sit close to each others or next to humans).</p></li>

Has lamarckism been discredited?,"<p>Lamarckism is a pre-darwinian theory according to which an organism's traits acquired to adapt to the environment are passed onto its offspring. A couple of years ago, I attended an event with Richard Dawkins and Jerry Coyne, both preeminent evolutionary biologists, in which I remember them agreeing that it is basically B.S. and that acquired traits don't get passed but instead propagate themselves through natural selection. As a non expert in biology, it does not make sense to me that acquired traits would make their way into the genotype and then get passed on, which coincides with what Dawkins was saying. But I am a non expert.</p>

<p>I also have read a few things about epigenetics and it sounds strangely similar to lamarckism. Steven Pinker also discusses all these things in The Blank Slate and he gives a notion that thare is some idealistic ideology behind promoting ideas that we can radically change an organism by environmental conditioning and ""save"" those changes into the genotype. He says that ideology is to justify government programs aimed at rapidly enhancing mankind whereas natural selection, which proponents of such ideas may deem reactionary, simply is not so optimistic.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is lamarckism, or inheritance of acquired traits, been conclusively discredited?</li>
<li>What does lamarckism relate to epigenetics</li>
</ol>
",92317,03-04-2020 05:09,Why is Lamarck's evolutionary theory considered incorrect?,"<p>Many sources postulate without much argumentation that Lamarck's evolutionary theory is ""obviously incorrect"". A classic example provided in such sources is the one with giraffes, in which Lamarck argued that the necks of these animals became long as a result of continually stretching to reach high foliage. This mechanism for adaptive change in response to the environment is considered wrong.</p>

<p>Now the counterargument to Lamarck's ideas comprises modern findings in genetics. So it is stated that organisms pass down traits through predetermined genetic information, <em>not based on environmental adaptations</em> during their lifetime. Furthermore, genetic research shows that living organisms cannot alter their genetic material as needed.</p>

<ul>
<li>Doesn't the latter contradict the evolutionary theory itself, which states that nature (i.e. environment) shapes species through natural selection in the environmental milieu? If it is not the environmental/natural factor that is responsible for genetic evolution, then what is?</li>
<li>If genetic material were to be unchangeable, then how would adaptation to the environment and consequent evolutionary change would ever be possible? The genotype (following this logic) would remain the same.</li>
<li>And lastly, maybe giraffes do not develop long necks <em>at such a rapid pace</em> (as Lamarck probably thought) by simply stretching their necks in one generation; however, what, if not neck stretching, is responsible for their consistently longer necks throughout thousands or millions of years? Hadn't the environment gradually shaped their genotype? Similarly, if I run more often, maybe my children will not become more fit, but isn't it just a matter of time (thousands of years) that if all of us consistently run a lot, then our offspring will eventually become more fit? Wouldn't our voluntary efforts eventually enhance our genetics? I do not see any problem with Lamarck's logic at all, except probably the time frame.</li>

The law that matter is neither created nor destroyed surely applies as shown by the chemical pathway in the photosynthesis and respiration process.</p>

<p>6CO2 + 6H2O + sunlight energy.  -----> C6H12O6 + 6O2
C6H12O6 + 6O2.                  -----> 6H2O + ATP (energy) + 6CO2</p>

<p>Thus the SAME amount of 6CO2 taken in is released, in order for the plant to have formation of the ATP usable energy for plant tissue creation, so photosynthesis cannot happen at a  more rapid rate than respiration. If that happened, then yes, more CO2 is removed then released, but that would leave an unbalanced equation.
I am not arguing the story further down the road of tree tissue and carbon sequestration/storage. </p>

Is there a theoretical maximum on the number of sexes a given species can have?,"<p><strong>Background:</strong> To the best of my knowledge, most sexually-reproducing species of organism have two sexes, although there are also sexually-reproducing species of organism (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis_fencing"" rel=""noreferrer"">flatworms</a> come to mind) which have only one sex. (Depending on one's definition of sex.)</p>

<p><a href=""http://blog.mycology.cornell.edu/2010/06/02/a-fungus-walks-into-a-singles-bar/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Many species of fungi</a> are both sexually reproducing and apparently have more than two sexes. (Depending on one's definition of sex.)</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-blotched_lizard#Sex"" rel=""noreferrer"">There are also species of lizards</a> with more than two biologically determined ""gender morphs"". It is even more debatable than in the case of fungi whether these morphs should be considered separate ""sexes"" or not, since their mating compatibility network is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph"" rel=""noreferrer"">bipartite</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong><br>
Is there a theoretical maximum on the number of sexes a given species of organism can have?</p>

<p><strong>Elaboration:</strong>
There would also be a lot of different possibilities -- already with three sexes, one can imagine at least two different means by which sexual reproduction could occur -- any one of three combinations of two individuals from two distinct sexes (most likely in ""rock-paper-scissors"" fashion), or the combination of three individuals from all three distinct sexes. </p>

<p>How, for example, might either of these two scenarios be maladaptive compared to sexual reproduction of two individuals in species with two or fewer sexes?</p>

<p>I am asking about species with more than two sexes/mating types in general, <strong><em>not</em></strong> necessarily about situations where more than two sexes are involved in a single reproductive event. (Contrast with this <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/57645/why-has-evolution-favored-sexual-reproduction-using-two-mates-over-sexual-reprod"">related question</a>.) I am also not restricting to animals, or even multi-cellular organisms, or even eukaryotes, since these restrictions might affect the answer. (Contrast with this <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2738/why-do-only-two-sexes-exist-for-animals"">related question</a>.)</p>

<p>Note that <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/a/2796/25755"">this answer</a> to the second related question implies that we should expect the mating compatibility network of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisogamy"" rel=""noreferrer"">anisogamous</a> sexually reproducing organisms to be bipartite. But note that, as in the example of the side-blotched lizards, this doesn't necessarily preclude having more than two sexes, nor does it give a theoretical maximum to the number of possible sexes. And since I don't want to necessarily restrict to anisogamous sexually reproducing organisms (i.e. isogamous ones would also be fine), then that answer also does not provide a theoretical maximum for isogamous sexually reproducing organisms either.</p>

Has human evolution currently stopped?,"<p>Due to the advent of social networking and dating sites, it is now possible for almost anyone to find a potential mate. Therefore, there is not as much of a pressure based on physical characteristics or even intelligence anymore. Society does not present the same pressures as was historically present in nature to find food and avoid being killed by predators and potential mating rivals. Almost all alleles regardless of their characteristics are passed on to the next generation through someone or another and attractive traits are no longer chosen above deficient ones. The only exception often being conditions such as dwarfism, Down Syndrome or Parkinson's Disease where the recipients of disadvantageous alleles choose to remove themselves from the gene pool.</p>

",65654,08-09-2017 12:11,Do humans produce rennin?,"<p>At school, we've been taught that human infants produce rennin/chymosin (which aids in the digestion of milk).

There is, however, <strong>no mention</strong> of prorennin.

How do transitional forms survive without the full adaptation?,"<p>This may be an odd question, but this is one thing I've always wondered. How does a dragonfly ancestor with early structures that will one day become wings gain any benefit from these useless limbs that don't work?</p>

<p>It seems in an intermediary context like this, that the adaptation would almost fall under a category more along the lines of something vestigial--something defunct.</p>

<p>I understand the creature adapts with no understanding or control of the process, and it takes extremely long periods of time to see any significant changes from one anatomy to another, but it would seem that statistically that would work against the animal, not for it. It's not like the dragonfly goes from the land and water to having fancy new fully operational wings.</p>

<p>The longer a species is stuck with an unhelpful adaptation, the longer they would be exposed and at a disadvantage. There is one way in which I could see this happening, and that is a prolonged series of random mutation in favor a winged route for the insect with no real input from their environment.</p>

<p>We all know that mutation and variation drift (all of which are relatively random) are part of the evolutionary process, but it is often described in more concrete terms, and the creatures in between an ancestor and a descendant have been discovered and described, but often not very well to the public.</p>

<p>The mutant albino bear ancestor being better suited for arctic stealth and eventually becoming the polar bear and diverging from the brown bear is an example given in the new Cosmos that actually could happen overnight. The bear is born with the full adaptation.</p>

<p>Even if the bear weren't instantly white, fur slowly becoming lighter leading to better hiding capability, or having a thicker coat to help it keep warm makes more sense than the precursor to an entire limb like wings or a tail though.</p>

<p>I suppose that it's possible to say the that random mutation is the primary method of evolution, and the apparent improbability of plants and animals surviving with incomplete, underdeveloped adaptations can be answered by realizing that the plants and animals alive today are the cousins of countless species that actually weren't helped by the wings, and some of that is random too.</p>

<p>And with that in mind, it's slightly more obvious, but I'm wondering if there's more to it or something I'm overlooking.</p>

<p>I've struggled to find any discussion about this topic in the literature, which I may have simply missed because it often goes over my head. I'm hoping my conclusion is helpful.</p>
",66460,03-10-2017 17:49,Evolutionary Midways,"<p>Given that the mechanism of natural selection is sensitive, how do species survive in an evolutionary midway? The ability to breath in air requires complex protein systems. An animal that is developing these organs would not be able to utilize its function until it fully evolves. While it doesn't, wouldn't the wasted resources used in growing half-developed lungs be.. wasted? Or is all evolution continuous?</p>

"How many nucleic acids is there in ""one molecule of DNA""?","<p>I am confused...  People usually say that ""DNA"" is made of two strands deoxyribonucleic acid bound together. Nonetheless, the acronym ""DNA"" means ""deoxyribonucleic acid"". </p>

Facial uniqueness of some animals of the same species,"<p>Do birds of the same species ,such as each pigeon that we see in cities, have unique facial geometries (facial phenotypes) regardless of their feather ,colors, spots etc? Sometimes it is almost impossible to distinguish two pigeons between each other just looking at their facial structure and curvature of their heads.</p>

<p>Human face has evolved with countless of varieties such as shape of nose, distance between the eyes, proportion of mouth and the nose etc.
Billions of humans have existed so far and billions of humans will ever exist each have unique facial features.</p>

<p>However some animals of the same species (birds like pigeons, baby chicks, fish species like sardines and sea bream etc) look like sharing a limited amount of variations in their facial geometries therefore they become distinguishable only because of their colors, patterns etc. I know that mammals such as apes or dogs have unique faces almost  as distinctive as humans. I also know that human brain is already attuned to distinguish differences in human faces more than any other animal. </p>

<p>What I would like to understand whether all pigeons have existed so far and will exist furthermore have unique facial geometries like humans? Or do they all differ in millimetric level which cannot be captured by naked human eyes? Can two pigeons(or sardines) of the same species share exact same facial geometries unlike humans?

<p><strong>Why do human facial and body shapes vary so much?</strong></p>

<p>I understand that human beings live in many different environments (e.g. hot and cold) and have adapted to these (e.g. through lighter or darker skin color), but there seems to be much variation that has no apparent evolutionary purpose. So does the difference have a purpose in itself? That is, did we evlove to vary in appearance, and what is the purpose of this variation?</p>

What exactly is a centimorgan?,"<p>Centimorgan's aren't physical distances. The analogy that I could come up with is if you had an array with 10 items,</p>

<pre><code>A = [a, b, c, d, e, f ,g ,h ,i ,j, k]
</code></pre>

<p>The distance of <code>a</code> in the array is closer to <code>b</code> than <code>k</code>, ie A[0] is closer to A[1] than A[10] so that the centimorgan of A[0] and A[1] is less than A[0] and A[10]?</p>
",68400,29-11-2017 17:19,Genetic linkage greater than 50 centimorgans,"<p>Classically, the linkage between two loci can be measured in centimorgans (cM), which represents the percent chance that these two loci will recombine an odd number of times (generating a recombinant genotype).</p>

<p>Due to independent assortment, markers on different chromosomes are expected to recombine 50% of the time. As I understand, if one conducts a classic experiment and counts various progeny, then deduces the apparent linkage, values of 50 cM or more are interpreted as ""<em>impossible to determine whether on separate chromosomes or just recombines very often</em>"". See (<a href=""https://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~mcclean/plsc431/linkage/linkage2.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>), with grammar corrected:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The final point that we need to make regards the maximum distance that we can measure. Because of the way in which the calculations are performed, we can never have more (than) 50% recombinant gametes. Therefore the (maximum) distance that two genes can be apart and still measure that distance is just less (than) 50 cM. If two genes are greater than 50 cM apart, then we can not determine if they reside on the same chromosome or are on different chromosomes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wikipedia gives an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimorgan"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">analytical solution</a> and also remarks that (d is physical distance):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The probability of recombination is approximately d/100 for small values of d and approaches 50% as d goes to infinity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, what happens if the linkage <em>is</em> greater than 50 cM? It seems like classical experiments aside, such a situation is possible in reality.</p>

<p>For instance, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/mapview/maps.cgi?taxid=4932&amp;chr=IV"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">yeast chromosome IV is 1530 kb long</a>, and <a href=""http://www.yeastgenome.org/pgMaps/pgMap.shtml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">averages 0.31 cM/kbp</a>. Let's take two genes on Chr.IV:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?cmd=retrieve&amp;dopt=full_report&amp;list_uids=851667"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DNF2</a> is at about +631 kb.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?cmd=retrieve&amp;dopt=full_report&amp;list_uids=852068"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TOM1</a> is at about +1370 kb.</li>
</ul>

<p>The physical distance between these is about 734 kb. According to the cM/kbp value, the centimorgan distance is <span class=""math-container"">$734\text{ kb} \cdot 0.31\text{ cM}/\text{kb} = 228 \text{ cM}$</span> . How to interpret this 228?</p>

<p>If I mate a haploid yeast which is <em>DNF2 TOM1</em> with another which is <em>dnf2 tom1</em> (lowercase indicating minor allele rather than deletion), then sporulate them, what is the chance of getting spores with <em>DNF2 tom1</em> or <em>dnf2 TOM1</em> genotypes?</p>

<p>I realize that the cM/kbp value is only a simplification and that in practice linkage is a more complex phenomenon. Nevertheless, it seems plausible that several crossover events can happen on Chr.IV since it is so big. This includes the possibility of 1, 3, 5 and more crossovers which would create a hybrid (assuming they all happen between these two loci), as well as the possibility of 2, 4, etc crossovers which would create a non-hybrid spore (at least as far as our chosen markers are concerned).</p>

Is there any possibility that gender is determined by Temperature?,"<p>One day I was watching TV show. It was based on Fire Dragon. They stated that if the dragon provide greater warmth to the egg, then a male Dragon will hatch. And if the Dragon provide less warmth to the egg it will be female Dragon.

",69350,06-01-2018 03:54,Have there been any theories put forward as to the reasons behind Temperature-Dependant Sex Determination in reptiles?,"<p>This applies to most if not all reptiles, but I'll write about leopard geckos since that's what I know.</p>

<p>Incubation temperature of the eggs makes a big difference in the development of the gecko. Obviously excessively high or low temperatures will kill the embryo, but inside the safe temperature range there are some interesting effects. The most well-known is Temperature-Dependant Sex Determination (TDSD).</p>

<p>Studies have been done and it is quite well-documented that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Incubating eggs at the mid-point of the safe range results in predominantly male offspring.</li>
<li>Incubating eggs at the high <em>or</em> low end of the range <em>both</em> result in predominantly female offspring.</li>
</ul>

<p>According to my gecko book, there are also some interesting effects regarding males that hatch from female-biased temperatures being more sexually active but less aggressive to females than the ""macho"" males produced at male-biased temperatures, females at female-biased temperatures being the most fertile and high-temperature females being more aggressive than lower-temperature females.</p>

<p>(Incubation temperature also affects colour - specifically melanin production levels. AFAIK it's not known whether this is a direct effect of the temperature or an indirect effect from the changes in sex hormones at the different temperatures. It's probably a different enough issue to warrant a separate question, though.)</p>

<p>Going back to TDSD, my question is: <strong>what theories have put forward to <em>explain</em> this sex determination?</strong> Evolutionarily speaking, how did this come about? Are males less likely to survive so they are only produced at safe temperatures? Does the optimal male:female ratio for propagating the species change in adverse conditions?</p>

<p><strong>I'm not looking for random guesses.</strong> I'm interested in knowing if there have been any theories put forward from knowledgeable and reputable sources. </p>

How many generations does it take for one species to become a new one?,"<p>First lets consider that a species is a group of individuals that can reproduce by breeding fertile offsprings.</p>

<p>It's usually said that evolution takes a very long time. Lets say that 1000 generations are required for species A to evolve into species B.</p>

<p>Which species would generation 999 belong to, A or B ?<br>
If A then it means that there was no evolution in 999 generations and that the entire evolution is going to happen in a single generation from 999 to 1000.<br>
If B then which specie does generation 998 belong to ?
etc etc</p>

<p>In the end it seems to me that if there is evolution it can only be instantaneous, but that requires many improbable things, one of them being that the spermatozoids and ovules of species A contain DNA of species B !</p>

<p>How does that work ?</p>

<p>Within the past few years I've seen an upcropping of pop-sci articles discussing the interbreeding between pre-historic species of humans. In everything that I see in these articles, as well as in scientific literature (my college Bio textbook, among others), I see these different humans being referred to as separate species. </p>

I lifted up my shirt to find these tiny bugs crawling all over my upper body. I did some Googling, went upstairs and carefully observed my bedding and bed, however, the only evidence I found was a few newborn fleas / flea larvae (which I intend to deal with today). I should also mention that a flock of wild Egyptian Geese have been raising five goslings in my yard, and they get very close to me when I'm walking outside at times. My house is also not carpeted, it has oregon pine floors throughout.

Using different polysaccharides for coagulation,"<p>Would a particular type of polysaccharide be better at coagulation than another? For example, would the presence of cellulose in a bio-coagulant be more effective at coagulation than the presence of starch or glycogen? I would like to know as I am doing an experiment about it and since nobody has done this before, I don't know whether having a higher concentration or ratio of a certain polysaccharide in a bio-coagulant compared to other polysaccharides will have an effect on coagulation efficiency?</p>
",72684,22-04-2018 06:37,Is starch a better coagulant than cellulose?,"<p>In an experiment, I used plantain peels (with a very high starch content and very little cellulose) and grapefruit peels (with a very high cellulose content and no starch) as coagulants (ensuring that I used equal masses of each peel) to improve the turbidity of water contaminated with wood chips and kaolin. Although the grapefruit was able to remove turbidity, I found that the plantain worked better. By the way, the same amount of cellulose was present (50%) in the grapefruit peels as starch present (50%) in the plantain peels. However, I can't work out why a coagulant concentrated with starch is more effective at lowering the turbidity of water compared to a coagulant concentrated with cellulose? Essentially, I don't know why starch helps more than cellulose with coagulation. Help would be much appreciated :)</p>

<p>If you use this link, you will find the method I used under ""Preparation of Bio-flocculant"" to turn the peels into coagulants: akademiabaru.com/doc/progeeV1_P47_56.pdf. To summarize, I dried them in an oven and turned them into very fine powder.</p>

<p>First of all, let us remove all human sentimental attributes from this question (such as connotations of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">scientific racism</a> or emotional reactions thereof) and ask it from a purely scientific point of view. The typical facial feature of a West/Central African person (the so-called <a href=""http://crab.rutgers.edu/~glasker/DIFFERENTAFRICANS2003.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">broad African type</a>) exhibits a wide nose, a lack of nasal bridge projection (similar to many Asian noses) and a prognathous skull shape that resembles more closely to our ancestor Homo Heidelbergensis than many other indigenous phenotypes from other parts of the world do.</p>

<p>I agree that this claim sounds anecdotal, and is certainly not true of all Africans (for example, Ethiopians), but one cannot dismiss it simply on grounds of ethical policing. I cannot help but notice that many of my African friends remind me of our shared ancestry (with no disrespect meant whatsoever), as is clear from the photographs below, one of a supposed Homo Heidelbergensis and one of a random African Homo Sapiens of today.</p>

Is this appearance an illusion and possibly a construct of a prejudiced mind, or does this have a valid scientific answer?

<blockquote>
  <p>keeping diversity is useful for parameter exploration or to adapt to future environmental change</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My initial thought was that evolution doesn't ""know"" about the future, so natural selection might decrease genetic diversity even if it meant dooming the species in the long term.</p>

<p>On the other hand, species that have low genetic diversity may be more likely to go extinct eventually.  So perhaps over time the surviving taxa are those that have evolved mechanims to ""hedge their bets"" against future environmental changes.</p>

<p>It's clear that some of the parameters that affect genetic diversity within a species (e.g. mate selection, mutation rate) are heritable, but it's unclear to me how the short-term processes of natural selection relate to the extremely long-term processes of speciation and extinction.  This gets into some of the same issues as group selection — how can natural selection, acting on individuals, lead to traits that benefit entire populations or clades?  (Perhaps this simply cannot happen.)</p>

<p>Has any work been done on the topic of extinction resistance or the evolution of mechanisms to create and preserve diversity within populations or taxa?</p>

<p>This is a big question so I don't expect a full answer here.  I'm just looking for some references as a starting point to learn more about this topic.</p>

Does cellular/organism death happen to enable evolution?,"<p>On the topic of whether we could conceivably understand death and extend human lifespans significantly - I'm wondering if any smart folks can point me to where my thinking regarding death may be wonky. </p>

<p><strong>Hypothesis: Death only exists as an evolutionary advantage, and decoding the genome would point to designed cell death</strong></p>

<p>Offspring provide a chance for mutations and evolution. Bacteria, with their short doubling time, can evolve very quickly (e.g. antibiotic resistance). Humans, with a longer lifespan, cannot evolve as quickly. 
While the exact metric above is not linked to lifespan directly (its actually reproductive rate), I'd argue that at stable/equilibrium population size (due to resource constraints) they are indirectly correlated. </p>

<p>Understandably, there are many factors that introduce mutation into a species, other than death rate. Some species may have more powerful DNA editing enzyme variants that lower mutation rates. </p>

<p>Some counter arguments may include 'wear and tear', the notion that no organism can live forever as any ordered matter tends to break down over time. Some cold-water fish have low metabolism rates and long lifespans. </p>

Do Squirrels have 4 legs OR 2 arms and 2 legs?,"<p>Do squirrels have four legs, or two arms and two legs?</p>

<p>I first asked this question many years ago, and it has since unearthed a whole array of conundrums and questions that I have struggled to get a conclusive answer to.</p>

<p>See a squirrel (often described as a quadruped, 4 feet, which implies 4 legs) can stand on its back two legs and hold a nut in the paws of its front two legs - but those front legs are jointed in a very similar way to arms, look like arms and are being used as arms.</p>

<p>When a squirrel runs, it uses all four limbs - but then so does a gorilla, and that definitely has arms.</p>

<p>So in trying to answer this seemingly simple question I ended up lost in a world of definitions and further questions - questions like ""what is an arm anyway?""  ""what is the difference between a paw and a hand or foot?"" - and after trying to find out the answers to those questions I ended up in a much stranger world.  Octopuses have arms, but no hands - bats have hands, but no arms (I will spare you one of the resulting conversations which wanted to know how long a nose has to be until it's a trunk, especially concerning anteaters).</p>

<p>I could be wrong but it seems to me that if your front paws are called hands, then you have two arms and two legs.  Koalas, for instance, are often described as having hands despite also being described as quadrupeds.  Perhaps the differences are merely linguistic choices rather than anything relating to the biological nature of these limbs.  I just don't know anymore, and at this stage, I am starting to wonder if I have given this question way too much thought, time and energy.</p>

Why do we develop addiction?,"<p>Recently, while on the train, I saw a person not holding the handrails on purpose. He decided that playing a game with no outcome whatsoever was more important than his safety. In fact, he bumped into the overhead luggage carrier several times. Twice he almost stumbled and fell, with a possibly very negative outcome for him.
Once he stumbled and bumped so hard into the carrier, it left a red mark on his face, even after facing it earlier. 
Still he refused to hold a handrail as that would have prevented him from playing the game.
Clearly his addiction to the game won over any sense of self protection.</p>

<p>Now thinking about it, I think this is the case with most addictions. At the end, they are to some degree, harmful to the addicted person(imho).
Taking this to the time when we were still facing predators, it must have been careless just to think of getting delicious berries whilst not considering the exposure to predators it came with.
These individuals that are addicted (in a way) and don't care of the dangers associated with a problem, are harmed more often.
Thus, making addiction an evolutionary disadvantage.
Therefore, being easily addicted, as a trait, shouldn't have developed much.</p>

<p>Yet addiction is one of the worst problems of humanity and has been so for a long time.</p>

Do Traits Have to be Adaptive in Order to Survive?,"<p>I'm reading Michael Pollan's book 'How to Change Your Mind', which is largely about psychedelic mushrooms. In discussing the biology of the mushrooms, he writes:</p>

<p>'Even if psilocybin in mushrooms began as 'an accident of a metabolic pathway', the fact that it wasn't discarded during the course of the species' evolution suggests it must have offered some benefit.'</p>

<p>I'm wondering if this is actually true. In general, I'm wondering if it is true that traits that do not confer advantage will eventually be weeded out. </p>

<p>Being ignorant of the finer points of evolution/natural selection, I can make arguments both ways. On the one hand, it seems that the intense competition would make investing any resources at all in a trait that was not beneficial a totally losing proposition. Therefore no traits that weren't positively adaptive would survive. On the other hand, there seem to be all kinds of traits that are 'neutral' in fitness terms but which survive anyway. E.g. coccyx, male nipples, appendix, whale legs, etc. </p>

<p>I am not talking about information encoded in the genome, which can be present but not expressed. I am talking about phenotypes, i.e. traits that get expressed in interactions with the environment, such as the psilocybin chemicals in these mushrooms. (Though I suppose unexpressed genetic info could never be selected for or against by natural selection by definition.)</p>

<p>So to put a very fine point on my question: Is it possible/likely that psilocybin mushrooms produce a chemical that happens to engender hallucinations, not because doing so is adaptive, but just incidentally? So that this property would be something like the redness of blood, i.e. not adaptive in itself but just a matter of happenstance?    </p>

life based on different elements,"<p>It is commonly proposed to look for life based on silicon, based on it's relative abundance and similarity to carbon. However, carbon and silicon are not completely interchangeable. The bond strength between carbon or silicon and itself is different, thus, some molecules with high chain length can not be replicated with silicone. Similarely, molecules such as proteins, for which all carbon atoms are replaced with silicon, would not retain their form and thus not their function.</p>

<p>Is life based on silicone still possible, just under a different environment?</p>

<p>This would affect how we should look for aliens. Also, if silicon based life is unlikely, is there some other element that could lead to life?</p>

<p>Also, I might misunderstand the meaning of ""repeated host jumps transmission"".

Why aren't viruses considered to be non-cellular life?,"<p>I have always thought of viruses as being non-cellular lifeforms. And no, it isn't just because of Wikipedia. I have heard that there are viruses that are so complex, that they are very close to being considered cellular. And some viruses infect <strong><em>other viruses</em></strong>. Wow, I never thought parasitism would scale all the way down to viruses as the host until I found out about viruses that infect other viruses. So, here are the criteria scientists have used for defining living vs non-living for centuries:</p>

<ol>
<li>Made of at least 1 cell -> Some viruses have membranes and some cells have cell walls. Sure, cell walls are normally made up of complex sugars, but what is to say that there couldn't be lifeforms with proteins as the most prevalent component of a cell wall? And some very large viruses get close to being actual cells.</li>
<li>Metabolism -> This is one thing that even the most complex of viruses fail.</li>
<li>Responding to stimulus -> I think viruses do respond to a stimulus, just not in the way we normally think of responding to a stimulus. I mean, they clearly respond to temperature(cold temperature, won't reproduce or at least will reproduce very slowly, moderate temperature, will definitely reproduce, but not at peak reproduction rate, hot temperature, peak reproduction rate reached) and temperature is a stimulus.</li>
<li>Grow, Develop, Die -> The virus does develop, sort of, when viruses get built in the host cell(which is kind of analogous to an egg cell becoming a baby, only on a much much smaller scale). And viruses do die as well. The only thing they fail at here is growth. The virus doesn't get bigger or more complex than the parent virus unless it mutates and the mutated virus has size and/or complexity promoting genes that the original virus didn't have.</li>
<li>Highly organized -> Small viruses like the flu virus fail at this. Some bigger viruses though don't fail this criterion</li>
<li>Maintain Homeostasis -> All viruses fail at this, even the complex viruses</li>
<li>The ability to reproduce -> Viruses don't reproduce independently from a host but they do reproduce. If viruses were to be considered non-living because of the inability to reproduce independently of a host, than wouldn't your average parasite also be considered non-living for the same reason? Clearly parasites aren't considered non-living just because they can't independently reproduce. Viruses are just parasites of the cell, so I would say that they do meet this criterion, because viruses and their relationship to cells is parasitic. Viruses infecting other viruses also makes me think that viruses meet this criterion</li>
<li>DNA changes and thus the organism evolves -> This is definitely true for viruses. Viruses evolve super fast, even just 1 cell getting infected by 2 viruses simultaneously is enough for completely different viruses to form as the genetic material and capsid proteins are exchanged between viruses as they are built(I have seen this illustrated before with 2 different flu viruses infecting one cell and 4 different viruses coming out of the cell, both the original flu viruses and 2 completely different flu viruses). So the evolution rate of viruses can be as fast as a single generation compared to the thousands of years minimum it takes for the same amount of evolution relatively speaking to occur in a multicellular organism.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Clearly, viruses do meet a lot of the criteria for a living organism. So with this and all the new discoveries of things like viruses getting ever closer to the cell in complexity and viruses that infect other viruses, why aren't viruses considered to be non-cellular lifeforms?</strong></p>

How do viruses die outside of host cells?,"<p>I am posting a question that a friend of mine has asked.  My friend wrongly assumes that SARS-CoV-2 virus can be transmitted through blood, although there is no such evidence.  However, his question remains a valid one.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>With so much news about COVID-19 all around us, I have been doing some 
      study on viruses.  I do understand that viruses are not really living 
      creatures.  They just have some genetic information, which they can 
      pass on to the host cell, causing the virus to proliferate, and in some 
      cases interfere with the normal functioning of the cell.  Outside of a 
      host cell they are completely inert.  In fact they show all the traits 
      of a non-living entity.  I get that. </p>
  
  <p>My question is based on the following scenario.  Imagine there are two 
      doors, next to each other.  Let’s call them A and B.  There is a door 
      knob on each.  A COVID-19 patient sneezes near the doors, and some SARS-
      CoV-2 viruses land on each door knob (i.e. door A and door B).<br>
      Unfortunately within a few hours someone with a cut finger touches the 
      knob of door A and gets infected.  So far no dispute. </p>
  
  <p>Fast forward 5 years.  In the meantime the knob on door B never got 
      cleaned/wiped.  In other words, the inert viruses are still on the door 
      knob.  Again someone with a cut finger touches the knob of door B but 
      in this case the person does not get infected.  Why? </p>
  
  <p>Obviously something happened to the virus during these 5 years that 
      caused it to lose the ability to pass on its genetic information to the 
      host cell and replicate.  What exactly happened?</p>

To keep the discussion going, I would like to temporarily include the response here till a better response is posted.  Here it goes:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This isn't very professional, but there are the basics. Viruses are obligate parasites, which means they can't live outside a host (in this case, a cell) for long. Viruses get damaged as everything else, the damage taking many forms, such as hydrolysis, photolysis, free radical damage, reaction with other molecules (like detergent), conformation changes, dehydration, maillard reactions, and changes induced by heat of labile molecules (like decomposition). All types of damaging processes happen at an increased reaction rate with increasing light and heat. Viruses have rudimentary repair mechanisms if any, so it's a matter of time before they become inactivated. A damaged virus entering the body wouldn't be able to do much harm if any, as their genetic information would be damaged beyond repair, and so, not able to be replicated to make more viruses. Their proteins and genetic bits would still trigger an immune reaction and immunize against intact and not very damaged viruses (which is why damaged viruses are used in vaccines). Those damaged viruses that remained outside just become microbe food.  </p>

Bats in turn evolved by natural selection to not let viruses take over their body more than just a tiny bit. So it was to the evolutionary advantage of both bats and viruses that infect them to form a compromise where the virus gets to invade their bodies to a very small extent but not too much.</p>

On some of the nodes, there were a large number of extra stalks:</p>

<p>On each plant, the number and locations of these things varied, and not all of them had it. And we first assumed it was some ivy, or parasite, or separate plant, but it seemed pretty clear to us that it was coming right from the same branch.</p>

<p>We soon saw there were dead versions of this plant, and all of them had this ""extra shoot"" variation:</p>

",93232,05-05-2020 00:44,Evolution of hunting behavior of parasitoid wasps,"<p>Wasps in the genus <em>Pepsis</em> lay their eggs in a specific region on a species of tarantula and their larvae eat the tarantula organs in a specific sequence to keep it alive as long as possible.</p>

<p>How could this process have evolved, considering that a mistake at any stage results in death?</p>

<p>This is the description of the egg laying behaviour:</p>

<p>Upon finding a tarantula, the wasp locks its mandibles onto a foreleg and brings its stinger into position so as to paralyze it.  </p>

<p>During this process, the tarantula tries unsuccessfully to dislodge the wasp, but the wasp ultimately locates the right part of the tarantula in which to insert its stinger. </p>

<p>Upon inserting it, the wasp injects a venom that paralyzes the tarantula. Note that the tarantula is ten times the weight of the wasp, so the wasp takes very big risk in trying to attack such a tarantula. </p>

<p>The wasp then drags the tarantula into a hole that it has already dug. It pulls the tarantula down into the  hole, attaches its egg to a specific part of the tarantula's body and then covers up the hole so that predators won't find it. </p>

<p>When the egg hatches, the larva eats the organs of the tarantula in a specific sequence so as to keep the tarantula alive for several weeks. Eating in the wrong sequence results in the death of the tarantula, and its subsequent putrefaction, which means the death of the wasp larva. </p>

<p>When the larva successfully eats in the right sequence, it is able to obtain enough nourishment to prepare for metamorphosis, ultimately resulting in a full-grown wasp, which then exits the hole and becomes a predatory wasp. </p>

<p>These wasps are solitary, which means there are no conspecifics to teach the new wasp how to do all this. 
Thus, the entire behavioral program described above must be encoded in the wasp's genome.</p>

<p>The description above is based on: </p>

",93397,11-05-2020 13:21,Can ants sense food from a long distance?,"<p>I recently had ants find and then swarm to a food container that I put down on a desk. I'm curious as to whether an ant would have needed to get lucky (i.e., discovering the food after crawling up the desk) or ants have the ability to sense food from a distance.</p>

<p>I'm skeptical of believing that ants simply scout around until finding food; I'll use this case as an example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>My room has had no food or drink in it for weeks, so the area wouldn't be a ""hotspot"" for ants to be interested in.</p></li>
<li><p>I put the mostly empty food container down on my clean desk and turned my lamp off to work on the computer. No more than 2 hours later did I turn my light back on to discover a trail of ants swarming to the container I put down. It happened pretty quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>The desk is high, standing on four thin legs. I find it difficult to believe that an ant would crawl up the desk as often as a 2 hour time frame to scout for food, for the message to be passed to the colony so quickly. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I've been curious about this scenario for a long time. So my question:</p>

<p><strong>Can ants sense food from a long distance?</strong> If so, how does it work? If not, how is the phenomena (ants locating food quickly in unlikely places) explained?</p>

Are all antibodies against a common antigen identical?,"<p>I understand that when some antigen (e.g., virus, bacteria, etc.) is recognized in the body, antibodies specific to this antigen are produced that, in turn, bind to the antigen and effectively neutralize them as a potential threat to the organism.</p>
<p>Are all the antibodies that are produced against a specific antigen necessarily identical?  Either within a single organism (e.g., a single person), or between different organisms (e.g., between different people, different species, etc.)?  If two people get sick with the same disease, develop antibodies, and recover, are these antibodies the same?  If a human and some other animal get sick with the same disease, will the antibodies each develop match?</p>
<p>Key to the operation of the antibodies is their specific recognition/binding of the antigen.  I assume that the structure and composition of the antibody is tuned to bind to specific exposed moieties on the antigen.  I can imagine that there are many different potential binding sites on the antigen to target and many possible combinations of ways to recognize those sites by the antibodies.  I would think that it would be a remarkable coincidence (highly unlikely) if separate organisms both, independently, happened to develop the same “molecular strategy” for recognizing a particular antigen.  This outcome seems to be implied in this question,

",94356,25-06-2020 15:23,Can more than one antibody bind the same antigen,"<p>I'd like to clear something up about antibodies that I'm not sure I've understood in the articles I've read. Looking at concepts such as ""affinity maturation"", ""monovalent antigens"" and ""polyvalent antigens"" it seems as if there are multiple antibodies which can bind to the same antigen. (Although I think I'm right in saying that individual antibodies can only bind to one antigen?) However, when I read sentences like ""It has been estimated that humans generate about 10 billion different antibodies, each capable of binding a distinct epitope of an antigen"" on the Wikipedia page (for antibody) it does make it sound like it's one antibody per antigen? Is this the case? Or is it one antibody per epitope. Either way, to put this question in a nutshell:</p>

<p>Is it true to say that the same substance could bind with (and, therefore, be recognised by) more than one antibody, or not?</p>

<p>Also, if the answer is no, does that mean that antibodies with different binding affinities are classed as the same antibody or not?</p>

Na+ / K+ ATPase: How does it restore resting membrane potential?,"<p>Could not find any sources talking about this (in a clear manner). If the Na+ / K+ ATPase pumps 3 Na+ out for every 2 K+ it pumps in, thus making the cell more negative, why is the Na+ / K+ ATPase used to restore resting membrane potential following hyperpolarization? Wouldn't that must make the cell more negative, which is the opposite of what we want?</p>
",94867,25-07-2020 00:21,Why does resting potential not become continually more negative?,"<p>(Firstly, I know this is similar to other questions, but I have read those answers and they do not really cover this topic).</p>

<p>My understanding of resting potential: action potential is not being transmitted; by way of action potentials via Na+ and K+ pumps, for every 2K+ pumped in, 3Na+ is pumped out of the cell. This process is termed ""resting potential"" and the transmembrane pd roughly = -65mV. </p>

<p>If more Na+ are pumped out than K+ in, why does the resting potential difference remain at -65, why does it not continue to decrease (until an action potential is triggered)? </p>
