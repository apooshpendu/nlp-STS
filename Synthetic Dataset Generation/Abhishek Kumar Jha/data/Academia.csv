OCD and studying,"<p>Learning or studying is a huge burden on me and I always feel like I spend 10 times much more effort than any other student to start studying and keep it going. I am struggling with OCD many years and I also saw counseling, took medications etc but never benefited it. I am an engineering student and often fail many things such as exams, assignments or lab work due to my stupid compulsions. I always take studying too seriously and compel myself to be perfect at it(no flaw allowed). I cannot lose my focus, I must learn everything I see or read instantly, I must solve every question at one attempt etc. When I fail to be perfect, I am overrun by great dismotivation which makes me stop studying and procrastinate. I always think that those high achievers, A+ students are nothing but perfect learners and students when they sit down to study. What mindset should I use to trick my brain into accepting imperfections and mistakes?? I have no possibility to see a profession any more, I am on my own</p>

I always feel like I must be an expert regarding the subject and be able to answer all the questions that one might raise no matter how stupid or unrelated those questions are. That is why I am not academically successful and satisfied. What mindset should I adopt to overcome this situation? I feel totally frustrated and hopeless. I tried out psychological help but it keeps coming over and over.</p>

What does it mean to have a low quantitative but very high verbal/writing GRE for stats PhD application?,"<p>I am applying to statistics and biostatistics PhD programs for next year, and I just got my GRE scores back, and they weren't at all what I expected.</p>

<p>I ended up with a 159V/156Q/6.0AW, which corresponds to 83rd/61st/99th percentile in the verbal/quantitative/analytical writing sections, respectively. So, I have a combined score of 315 with a 6.0 writing.</p>

<p>I understand that most statistics programs place a premium on the quantitative score, and so I am a little worried about my low quantitative score, but I am wondering if the relatively high verbal/writing can offset the weakness there.</p>

<p>For some idea of what kind of student I am, I have about a 3.5 GPA with an applied math major, with a full course in real analysis, mathematical statistics and some graduate level regression theory, and potentially an honors thesis (pending). Since my scores are so atypical compared to other applicants (who typically have much stronger quantitative and lower verbal/writing), I am unsure of what my score means for my application as a whole.</p>

<p>I suppose the question of ""do stats programs care?"" can be generalized to ""do quantitative programs care?"". While I see there are some threads on low quantitative scores, there aren't too many about a low quant score combined with a high(er) verbal/writing score.</p>

How can a demoralized research student restore the passion for research?,"<p>To the point, I do love conducting research, however, I have put myself in a very difficult point of research that made me switch to another Ph.D. program for the sake of more technical support. However, I found the other group doesn't have the required set-up devices as they have mentioned earlier before arrival, moreover, they don't have any idea how to solve this complicated point which they are interested in already. Finally, I felt I am in the same blank loop.</p>

<p>To be honest, I began to lose motivation and passion and sometimes I feel lost. I don't know what to do, I see crappy research published and seems everything to me to be fake, I am asking myself: Why this happens to me?.</p>

<p>My dream is to be like Carl Segan, Neil Degrasse Tyson, and present interesting science TV show one day, but I don't know how to reach this goal and present what I am really interested in. </p>

<p>Honestly, I don't know how should be the exact question, but I feel miserable, I don't know whether I have to look for another different point of research and easy to be solved. This would obligate me to look for another different research lab.</p>

",119628,06-11-2018 16:04,How should I deal with becoming discouraged as a graduate student?,"<p>I am a third year (starting fourth year in the fall) PhD student in mathematics. I've passed all qualifying exams and am currently doing research. As far as I can tell, I am not doing poorly. I have the good fortune of having a great advisor, being in a very supportive department, and having friends and family who genuinely care about my success. </p>

<p>The fact is research is hard. It appears to consist primarily of staring at a problem for days and days and days without getting anywhere. Sometimes, rarely, I do figure something out and that feels wonderful, but the overwhelming majority of my time appears to be spent banging my head against a mostly figurative wall. I am not complaining about the material being hard, and I am not averse to putting in hard work, but I get frequently discouraged when I realize the vast volumes of mathematics that I yet know nothing about (and probably never will). It's very hard to quantify progress - in particular, there are too few tangible returns after too many hours worked. I find myself thinking along the lines of ""Oh, if only someone actually smart were thinking about this problem they would have solved it in moments"" and so on. </p>

<p>I've talked about this to some number of people; here is some advice I have received:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take a day off. Putting in hours upon hours of trying things doesn't magically lead to a solution, particularly if the brain is tired and just wants to sleep.</li>
<li>Have a hobby. Since math research doesn't exactly provide instant gratification, a hobby might provide some instead. </li>
<li>Talk to other graduate students. Realize that many graduate students go through this.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm interested to know how other folks have dealt with being discouraged as a graduate student. Does it get better with time and experience? Is this a sign that research is not for me and that I should seriously consider a life outside academia?</p>

Professor blatantly taking course material from internet (other schools),"<p>I am TAing for a CS course. The professor I am TAing for, I took the same course with him one year ago. In that semester and this current semester I am TAing, he has been taking lecture slides and simply relabeling the headers with our school name and date.

",119215,29-10-2018 21:18,Plagiarism of Lecture Slides,"<p><strong>Original Post:</strong></p>

<p>I recently attended a lecture with highly technical content.  One of the middle slides in the deck had a particular phrase that reminded me of something that I had read several years before.</p>

<p>It took me a few minutes, but I found the original source (another slide deck) and am shocked to find that the professor lifted 35 slides verbatim from the original source.  The University holds students accountable for plagiarism and strictly defines plagiarism such that this clearly fits.  The slides were used verbatim and no credit or reference was provided.  Further, logos were added and color schemes were changed to make make them look slightly more like original content.</p>

<p>What should I do?  This professor has a professional full time job and I can imagine this getting swept under the rug, but this is clearly plagiarism and is spelled out very clearly in the student conduct code.</p>

<p>Is this an overreaction or should I pursue this?  This is confounded by the fact that I am very disappointed by the rigor of the course and feel like the professor lacks adequate technical background to teach the course (I guess my suspicions came true).  I'm really busy at work so don't want to deal with a big todo, but believe this really discredits the academic integrity of the course.</p>

<p><strong>Additional content in response to comments:</strong></p>

<p>The University defines plagiarism as ""Using another writer's words without proper citation.""  There is no proper citation given here, and these are not educational materials.  This is 35 slides from someone else's tutorial presentation.</p>

<p>I do not believe that the professor and the author of the original content have a relationship.  I have emailed the author to enquire about any permissions or relationship.  Still, even with permission, this is still plagiarism as defined be most people and as defined by the University.</p>

<p>All original works in the US are implicitly copyright protected, so there is also a copyright issue, but this is not currently my concern, though it could be of interest to the original author.  I have emailed him, so this is up to him.</p>

<p>This <strong>is</strong> a US institution and is a top tier highly respected school.  I am also not a lay student, but a Ph.D. with a degree from a top tier university who has served as a faculty member at two top tier universities (including this one).  I have also taught undergraduate courses in the past.  I have never engaged in this type of plagiarism, have never known colleagues to do so, and am shocked that so many people suggest this is par for the course in teaching.  My doctorate is from a school that prides itself on its honor code and takes honor code violations very seriously and I have served on the honor council and deliberated on a case of plagiarism in the past.  I really am shocked by this incident.</p>

<p><strong>Response from Original Author of the Slides:</strong></p>

<p>I have received a response from the author of the slides and he states that the work is his original work, that there are no additional authors of the work, that no one has been given permission to present the work, and that he believes his copyright on the work has been infringed upon.  He has requested additional information to assert his claim on the copyright.</p>

<p>My undergraduate degree did have courses like C programming and OOPs, but nothing else. I took a computer course on Python at a local computer institute and interned during the vacation. </p>

<p>With my current qualifications I am unlikely to get any meaningful work in CS so I would like to use a masters degree to start a career in CS.</p>

<p>2) Computer Science courses on edX, Coursera</p>

<p>3) Professional certifications like CompTIA a+ / Network+ etc. </p>

Should papers peer reviews be done publicly?,"<p>Three reviewers assessed my paper and all of them rejected it (weak reject), and to be honest I am not so mad about the rejection. One of the reviewers gave really good feedback and his arguments about rejecting it were correct.</p>

<p><strong>But:</strong> The other two reviewers gave comments that were really wrong.
For example one of them said that my paper was short, but my paper had exactly the maximum allowed number of pages. Also his English was terrible and he was saying that the paper was written in bad English. I am not a native English speaker but my supervisor is, and he corrected all of my mistakes before submitting the paper.</p>

<p>Also the third reviewer made some claims (referring to my citations) that were wrong (so he didn't even read the papers that ""supported"" his arguments). I took the time and reread all of the papers that he referred to and all of his claims are false.</p>

<p>Lastly all of the reviewers gave completely different reasons for rejecting the paper which also seemed really weird to me.</p>

<p>I was thinking to complain to the conference but my supervisor suggested we shouldn't because we would just waste our time.</p>

<p>So my question is shouldn't peer reviews were public and is there any good reason that they are not?</p>
",118336,13-10-2018 03:15,Open versus Blind reviewing process,"<p>A question I have been wondering for a while is if there exists an actual proof that a blind reviewing process (i.e. where the reviewers are anonymous, and the reviews not published) is better than an open one (i.e. where the reviewers are not anonymous and/or the reviews are published along with the accepted papers). </p>

<p>Basically, whenever I question the fact that having a blind reviewing process does not guarantee any quality (which, somehow, usually coincides with receiving a poor review for a paper ...), I'm told that anonymity is crucial for the reviewing process. But is there any proof of that? I don't believe there exists any perfect system, but I'm just not sure why does the blind (or even double-blind) one is considered as the best (or the ""least worst""). </p>

Will low grades for a minor on my trascript affect my chances of getting into grad school?,"<p>So, I started out as an Information Technology major and now decided to pursue Psychology. I wanted to also pursue a minor in Computer Science instead because I am 1 class away from a minor. I am undecided what exactly I want to do after I graduate, but I do know I want to go to some sort of graduate school. So far, most of my grades have been at least a ""C"", most of them being A's. This semester I am taking 3 computer science classes and a calculus class. I have been struggling this semester and I don't count on having high grades (I realized I am not as interested in this field and have trouble understanding the subject matter). I think a few of my grades will end up being D's, but my GPA should still be over a 3.0. Once I start my psychology classes, I think I can bring my GPA back up. </p>

<p>So, I was wondering if graduate schools would worry about the low grades I may receive this semester even though they are not included in my psychology major. I also do not plan on retaking any classes.</p>

Why do many graduate programs in mathematics (United States) still have foreign language requirements today (in 2010s)?,"<p>As far as I know, nowadays most of the mathematical literature is written and published in English and mathematicians communicate with each other in English. Although there are certain number of books written in other languages (like EGA), but at the same time their counterparts also appear in English (like Stacks Project). However, many graduate programs still require their students to pass a language translation test in French, German or Russian (which a paper dictionary, not a dictionary app in cellphones, which seems even more ridiculous to me...).

Submit the same paper to several journals/conferences,"<p>(N.B.: This isn't a duplicate of <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/51/submitting-the-same-research-to-multiple-conferences"">Submitting the same research to multiple conferences</a>, though the question is related.)</p>

<p>I've written a paper and am looking for journals or conferences where I could present it. I intend to send the same work (with only minor changes to fit length restrictions, etc.) to several journals or conferences organizers, at the same time. The goal is <em>not</em> to actually publish the same work in several journals or talk about it in several conferences, but to do that in a single journal or conference, as quickly as possible. I have two things in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>The review process is typically very long. If my paper is rejected by a group of reviewers, I'll lose several months during which I could have found other prospects. This is made worse by the fact that calls for papers tend to occur at about the same time.</li>
<li>For conferences, I can't know in advance whether my institution will accept to cover the costs. If I'm accepted to a conference and my institution refuses to cover the costs, I'll have to wait for a new opportunity, which might itself become void, and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Is it ethical to submit the same paper to several journals or conferences at the same time, provided that, if my paper is accepted by several publishers/organizers, I follow up with only one of them, and disengage from the others?</em></p>

<p>And, if this is possible, how exactly ? (Should I explicitly inform the publisher or the organiser of the conference that I'm submitting the same work somewhere else ? Should I tell them where exactly I'm submitting the paper ? Should I tell them after the fact if I find a new opportunity in the meantime ? etc.)</p>
",117796,02-10-2018 18:12,Why should the scientific community avoid double submissions?,"<p>Every journal has strict rules about duplicate submissions, and I do not mean publishing the paper in 2 venues.</p>

<p>My approach is mostly from an economics point of view: Given the fact that most reviews take between 2-3 months, plus any number of months for a resubmission, limiting yourself to only one journal seems not only a waste of time for the individual, but an overall drag for the scientific community. Even if you make a groundbreaking discovery, it won't get published until about a year later.</p>

<p>Multiple submissions dramatically increase the chances of getting your work published, and if you get accepted in both, you can always pull out your paper. From a marketplace point of view, this makes sense, since in this way, journals would be fighting for authors and not the other way around. </p>

<ul>
<li>While applying for post-docs/faculty positions in academia</li>
<li>While applying to industrial research labs</li>

<p>For instance, I've read on some forums (I can't locate the link now) that while considering prospective applications for tenure-track faculty positions, very few Universities accept a candidate who has completed his/her Ph.D from a lower ranked school having a lesser ""brand"" value, irrespective of the fact whether he/she has published equally original work as his/her counterpart from an Ivy league college. How much truth is in this statement? It would be really great if someone already in academia, either as a newly-accepted faculty or someone on the Faculty Hiring committee could share their experiences/statistics on this regard. I'm simply interested to know the answer, without commenting at all on whether such a practice is justifiable.</p>

Disappointed about Academia,"<p>I was a first-year PhD student but was forced to quit although hard-working day and night! I am disappointed, I am now 27 and did not create family, left my home country. Problems from the past in my family hugely affect my mental health. I have OCD and some other health issues. </p>

<p>Everyone admires my personality in presenting my work, however I am now shocked as I dreamt of doing good research to really help people and imprint a memory before leaving this earth. But I found it does not look like that. When I was a little girl, I used to tell my late mother: ""I do not want to be an ordinary person, I want to add this world, to become an important person"".</p>

<p>However, while writing now I would burst in tears and feel deeply alone. I suffered from complaining, so I would forget to speak and grew used to keeping every thing inside. I am afraid for my family as I feel responsible and I would like to make their lives better. Maybe the problem was that I did not do as well as the others? I thought I could do something new and meaningful, but I ended up being kicked out.</p>

<p>I would be grateful if someone tell me how can I overcome this harsh period?</p>
",116879,13-09-2018 16:54,Forced to Quit PhD although the hard and proved work,"<p>I am a first year Ph. D student, and I have been working on a new topic of research.  I worked day and night to prove something new and verified it. I began my Ph. D while my supervisor was on travel, but he returned before I had been here for long.  When he returned, he told me we have to stop and not continue without any reasonable reasons.</p>

<p>After a few months he began treating me poorly---always belittling and underestimating---although I got two grants from a top conference, made videos and podcasts, and constantly received praise for my good work and personality.  </p>

<p>It seems that I have been treated as a competitor, not a collaborator.  Although agreeing with my approaches in private, my supervisor said false words to the committee to take the decision and stop my Ph. D work!</p>

<p>It is not surprising, as there was another former senior Ph. D student who I met on campus, who was not allowed to defend his Ph. D: this same supervisor claimed he was not able to finish his dissertation although he had published in a peer reviewed journal and having citation as well, it was scary and not familiar.</p>

<p>In front of committee, he lied, and said something without proving. I asked if he can make a detailed constructive criticism, but he could not.  All I can say that they are a gang literally, and he said words that show that he is jealous and doesn't want to see me having self confidence in my self. I know no one will believe me, but this is the truth.</p>

<p>Honestly, I am distressed and I'm losing sleep.  I had this dream where there were many people who saw me fail.  All things considered, I don't know whether what happened is good or bad, and I definitely don't know what I should do next!</p>

<p>I would be grateful for your advice and whether there is someone has encountered any similar situation.</p>

",116828,12-09-2018 23:13,Age and Graduate school,"<p>I am 33. I live in the US. I am a neither a US citizen, nor a green card holder. I have worked in various jobs as a research assistant (physics, biology, economics) usually involving programming, mathematics or statistics.  As a newly minted undergraduate, I didn't really have much confidence in myself and I completely ruled out graduate school as pointless.  I didn't think of myself as smart enough.  I drifted into working in labs, because those are some of the easiest ones for which one can get a work permit in the US as a non-American.</p>

<p>Having worked in academia for a while now, I've had a chance to leap into various fields and help build solutions to complex problems.  I think I have literally gone as far as I can go researching in academia with no higher degree.  I work at one of the top universities in the world.  (If you looked at US News rankings or the Academic Ranking of World Universities, it's in the top 5.)</p>

<p>Lately, I've been thinking about applying for graduate school.  I do have a few papers in various fields.  I'm thinking of a PhD in either pure mathematics, applied mathematics, statistics or computer science. </p>

<p>I see two big minuses to applying to graduate school:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Most people applying are more than a decade younger than I am.  (Alas, more than a few gray hairs have made an appearance in recent years.)</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps my achievements would look good for someone younger, but partially my achievements are the result of a long career rather than any special brilliance. So, I wonder how my record will be perceived.  I did take GRE and I scored 800 quantitative, 800 verbal and a 5 on the essay.  (I would most likely have to do a GRE subject test depending on what field I ultimately decided.)</p></li>

How to know if my research problem is interesting or not?,"<p>I have completed my masters in mathematics. I want to pursue PhD in mathematics. I want to frame a research question and write papers in my field.</p>

<p>But some  questions are bothering me:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How does one know that a research problem is interesting and after solving it, one will be able to publish in a good journal?</p></li>
<li><p>I know the famous journals in my field. But after reading them, how will I decide myself which problem will be beneficial to solve?</p></li>
<li><p>Also I have seen there are lots of unsolved problems given at the end of a paper in a journal.

",116632,09-09-2018 13:49,How to choose a good research problem?,"<p>I am working to get a PhD, maybe next year this time around. Currently, this is my second year. I have published 3 papers. All of them are not about one problem but consider different problems. My strategy to find a research idea/problem is given below.</p>

<p>1 - Read papers whose titles are either interesting or I have some apriori understanding of those titles.</p>

<p>2 - Understand those papers as best as I can. That is, I try to understand each detail presented in the paper except the simulation results (this is because I think simulation results are hard to reproduce).</p>

<p>3 - I analyze the paper and try to find a very small problem which can be addressed (i.e. I can solve it) by the methodology of the paper.</p>

<p>4 - If I am successful at step 3 I start working on that problem otherwise I repeat the process from step 1.</p>

<p>By applying this strategy I have been able to write 3 papers and I have submitted a fourth (I am not satisfied with those papers because at very best they can be considered average papers). But my concern is that the problems addressed in those papers do not belong to one area. As far as I have seen, for the profiles of some of the renowned researchers in my field their PhD work is focused on one area. One main thing I console myself with is that almost all of those researchers had good supervisors. My supervisor does not even read the draft/reviews of my papers and the suggestions that he provides during the meetings are so broad that the problem becomes intractable. Under these circumstances what are your opinions: Is there any better strategy to do research? </p>

<p>I will be very thankful to you for providing me suggestions or commenting on my dilemma.   </p>

At this time, I have two years left to graduate, and I'll be taking about 17-18 hours each semester until then, so it would be very difficult me to tack on an extra math course. I was considering simply officially auditing one, so that it appears on my transcript and so that I at least have some exposure to the subject. </p>

<p>My question is: will this have any positive benefits while I'm applying to graduate school? Or would the admissions committee assume that I didn't learn as much as someone who actually took the course, and take it with a grain of salt that I know the material?</p>

I dropped a graduate level MSE class in thermo recently because the course subject matter was dry (I don't like phase diagrams and chemical thermo too much) so I dropped it; I took the class originally to see if I would like MSE at the graduate level despite my career path moving towards mechanical engineering just to get a feel for things.

<p>As I write my thesis in a couple of places, especially in the literature review, I tend to reuse sentences from my publications. I try to restate them a bit, maybe change some words for their synonyms etc. but it is practically me writing about what I wrote before. It goes without saying that I cite/quote me at the end of a passage if I say something non-obvious (I found that slightly funny. :) ). The problem is that occasionally I am just explaining for instance how a certain estimation technique works; in that case I cite the original authors and not myself. The syntax in those occasions though is practically the same as the original passage I used in my publication; as I have explained it once and was consider good, I find no reason to reinvent myself (I do a mild rewording as I mentioned but that is quite insignificant). Same things goes for listings.

Is it normal for referees on a paper see to the names of other referees?,"<p>I recently refereed a paper for a journal. There were four referees, which for the field in question(number theory), is  a lot, especially for a short paper in a minor journal. I recommended a rejection based on a variety of issues. Today I got back a note that the paper had been resubmitted with extensive edits and asked to look at it again. The request to look at it again included the other three referee reports. Here's the strange bit: The referees's reports were not just included but the names as well. This question is not about seeing other referee reports but about seeing their names attached to those reports. </p>

<p>This partial loss of anonymity makes me  uncomfortable for two reasons. First,  one of the other referees is extremely senior in the field; in fact his review agreed closely with mine, but that certainly wasn't guaranteed. Second, it makes it more likely that a single referee who leaks who they are or knows one of a  paper's authors could let the authors know who the other referees are. I wouldn't be so concerned about the second except that I've already had an experience (where I was an author) where a referee unmasked himself after the fact. </p>

What is the advantage for the hiring committing to know if I am 18 or I have 17 children, aside from creating a chance to bias the hiring process with personal beliefs. Is it because they want to know that I am a prodigy child who got his/her PhD at 18 years old, or because if I am a 28 years old female married without children I will want children soon and so I will have to take maternity leave? Is this just an influence of the age/status discrimination in Europe where I see at times that  job offers are only open to certain categories of people (i.e.,younger than 30 years old) ?</p>

Does a PhD thesis have to be theoretical?,"<p>I already asked <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/114271/what-kind-of-knowledge-is-required-to-do-a-phd"">a question</a> in the past about the requirement to join a PhD program, but I am now wondering what makes a PhD thesis what it is. As seen on a lot of different websites and for example on <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/a/108804/96420"">this post</a>, one of the goals of a research thesis is to contribute to human knowledge by researching and documenting said research.</p>

<p>My personal goal is to contribute to human knowledge, and I feel like some researches in computer science (from different offers and thesis I saw) don't create <strong>knowledge</strong>, but are rather focused on creating <strong>a product</strong> that could as well be developed by any company with a research and development field. Because of this, I have trouble visualizing if there is really a knowledge creation in those PhDs, as I feel like those are not in a ""science"" related field but rather in a technical field (even though it's in the name ""computer science"").</p>

<p>Just to be clear, I'm not in any case questioning the benefit those research made, I think I am misunderstanding something in what a PhD is, and want clarifications to make sure I'm joining a PhD program with the right state of mind.</p>

<ul>
<li>Does a PhD thesis have to be theoretical ?</li>
<li>If not, what is the benefit of developing a technical product in a academic environment rather than in a private environment ? (for both the doctorate and the academic world)</li>
</ul>

However, nobody has informed me of this, yet, neither have I been asked if a want to take this over.

My professor who doesn't let me use my phone to read the textbook online in while I'm in class. What should I do?,"<p>I'm currently taking a course where I acquired the textbook as an e-book. Physical copies were available too, but I find kindle-versions far more convenient as I can read it wherever, whenever, using the kindle app on my phone.</p>

<p>Then naturally during lectures, I'll have my phone out (on mute of course) so that I can access the book. This is no different to any other student in the hall who have their physical copy out. In fact, I am less disturbing, because when those other students need to look something up, you'll hear pages turning, while my finger is silently scrolling my phone.</p>

<p>And yet, my professor doesn't seem to realize the benefits of technology and bans usage of phones. I of course do not intend to follow this policy: I've paid money for my e-book and am not going to spend more money for another physical copy just to appease this tosser.</p>

<p>However, my question is specifically, what should I do? Should I just keep on using my phone as usual, or should I contact some authority figure immediately? I'm not really worried about what he can do (because there's not really anything he CAN do, he can't throw me out of class or anything), but I would still like to take optimal steps.</p>
",120246,17-11-2018 21:17,How to handle lecturer who doesn't let me use my phone?,"<p>Inspired by another question where a user asks how to handle students with a phone, my question is from the opposite perspective: what is the correct response when a lecturer asks one to put away the phone? </p>

<p>This actually recently happened to me (a few months ago), and for obvious reasons (not wanting to interrupt the flow of the lecture, not wanting to have a falling out with the professor, etc), I just put my phone down. </p>

<p>But to be honest, I don't think that's the correct response, or at least I feel this is not the way it should be, because I find such demands inappropriate for a number of reasons, and so I shouldn't be giving in to them, should I?</p>

<hr>

<p>My reasoning:</p>

<p>First of all, and this may sound immature, but what I do with my phone is none of the lecturer's business. As long as I am not disturbing anybody (audio is always off, I am never typing loudly because it's a touch-screen, and nobody is distracted by the screen because I make sure to sit in the back), it shouldn't be a problem. </p>

<p>Secondly, I find that such demands can impede my learning. I often use the phone to look up information related to what the lecturer is actually talking about. If a topic is mentioned that I don't quite recall, a quick google search or a 10-second glance at the topic's Wikipedia page brings me up to speed. Or perhaps the textbook for the course is on my cloud server and I need to the phone to actually access the book, if I didn't bring (or even buy) the physical copy. </p>

<p>Finally, I find it highly disrespectful to call a student out for being on a phone in the middle of a lecture in front of all others. Such conversations, if they need to be had, should be had in private. Approach me after the lecture or during the break if you have a problem. Don't call me out in front of the entire class. </p>

",120267,18-11-2018 08:38,Things to focus on in a model lesson,"<p>A model lesson is a usual element in interviews for the faculty level positions. Normally this is not a full lesson but a 15-minute version which is performed in absence of actual students for just a few professors from a hiring committee.

What about techniques like jokes, questions to the audience (e.g. <em>how many of you are familiar with the definition of the derivative</em>), work in pairs, which you probably use in a real classroom &mdash; is it a good idea to demonstrate them in a room full of senior professors?

Applied math PhD programs - no. of courses to counterbalance low GPA?,"<p>I’m about to turn 38 and after much research and consideration I have decided that I need to return to school. My goal is to apply to applied math PhD programs and work in industry, ideally working on problems in computational science or fluid dynamics. </p>

<p>My major (economics and math) GPA from a good public school was around 3.03 and my GPA for my math courses fell at 2.88. Previously I experienced some very serious issues in my life that played its role in this (not an excuse but just an unfortunate fact at the time). </p>

<p>I’ve reached out to some professors about my background and have been told that my GPA, though not considered the sole factor in determining admission, is a problem. I plan on applying to and enrolling in a post baccalaureate program at an Ivy league college near my home and plan on sitting for the math GRE subject test but I feel like I need to take more courses than I can afford to even be considered for such programs (the courses for the post bac. program are around $6K each). </p>

<p>I’m prepared to use a good bit of my life savings and working part time to fund this but I would like to learn how I can get a better sense of how many more courses I should take to counterbalance my low GPA.  Would graduate committees be open to giving an unofficial assessment of my background before applying? I don’t plan on applying to the elite schools because I feel that my GPA would knock me out regardless. </p>

<p>Some background on me:</p>

<p>Since graduating I’ve had varied work experience such as working as a math tutor to working in finance in the last 10 years. I also have a good bit of experience programming and have furthered my education to some extent for what it's worth: passed an online specialization course in R programming that spanned roughly 9 months, picked up a number of financial licenses, and even passed an actuarial exam when I was considering that route. </p>

<p>I do have course work in calculus, econometrics, ODEs, linear algebra, and an intro to analysis course.</p>

<p>Any thoughts/insights are definitely much appreciated.</p>

<p>I am facing the problem that my paper was rejected form a journal (with the option to resubmit to the same journal again), where two reviews were provided.</p>

<p>The first review was well written, constructive and shows that the main parts of the paper were read and understood. Nevertheless, the first reviewer suggests to ""Review Again After Major Changes"". </p>

<p>The second review (who rejected the paper) on the other hand shows clearly that he neither read the paper nor the references listed in the related works section or any background material on that subject (as referenced in the paper or readily available online). Moreover, the review is filled with spelling mistakes, wrong references/citations and wrong claims. In essence, it gives the impression that it was written in a hurry without proper review of paper. But most importantly, the reviewer expects comparisons to concepts with are completely out of date and partly do not fit the discussed scenario.</p>

<p>I am currently preparing a resubmission to the same journal, which will most probably be handled by the same editor and reviewers. My questions is concerning the handling of the second review in the response letter in general and whether it is appropriate to contact the editor right now (few days after the receiving the rejection), shortly before or after the resubmission or not all regarding the review provided by the second reviewer.</p>

I do not want to start a flame, but to me, one of the two reviewers didn't took the necessary time to do a proper review.</p>

<p>The first reviewer made a thorough summary of the paper, and explained in an extremely clear way what were his/her doubts and which parts were not strong enough.
The second one looked like a baby plugging his hears and screaming ""<a href=""https://youtu.be/RdLVQty9Jho?list=PLGLIqX3a02LGzx3ZWvwCOfEa3r6eNNsx0&amp;t=15"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">It stinks! It stinks!</a>"". 
He only attempted to make a point that resulted to be wrong since he was substantially criticizing how an algorithm works (Random Forests), even though it's empirically demonstrated to be effective.</p>

<p>Now, based on the constructive critiques of the first reviewer I refined the manuscript and attempting to submit to another journal. What I can't stand is the behaviour of the second reviewer.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, is the idea to respond to the editor about the bad (where bad is like in the linked question) review(er) a viable action, or should I just ignore all of this and go on? </p>

How to reconcile interest in two (somewhat related) disciplines,"<p>I have two separate in-depth interests in two academic fields.  One of them in pure math (PhD in probability, also interested in complex analysis and differential geometry).  The other one is in software/computer science systems (privacy, distributed systems, this is where my current day-job is).
I do not want to spend my life having to give up one of them because I find both very interesting.  But apparently Morera once said that having very in-depth knowledge about a narrow field is better than superficial knowledge in several fields.  Is his advice correct?  Is it possible to make contributions in both areas?  I am currently 34 and in between early-career mid-career stage.</p>

The general consensus was that there was no reason at all to graduate early and that the lack of additional experience would hurt your chances at graduate school. I am concerned because I am graduating with only 2.5 years because I can only barely afford this by maxing out all loans.  I would love to be able to develop greater depth in my field. Instead it has been a constant sprint to finish before I run out of money completely. I was rejected from every top ten university, and the one token safety school I got into jacked up the price as soon as they found I had nowhere to go.</p>

<p>Are the criticisms that finishing too fast valid in the context of extreme debt? I am saving over $100,000 by finishing early, will this reason be accepted by graduate schools? I see that graduate students do not have to pay tuition and get a small stipend, this sounds like a wonderful way to pursue an education and is very attractive to me right now. I feel that my education is rushed and I have not had the time to contemplate open research questions which are very important for graduate admissions. Graduate school is also the path to a job in research labs or academia.</p>

When should I get business cards and how much do they actually matter as a graduate student who has not yet built up their CV?,"<p>Context: I am a graduate student within the social sciences, who will be obtaining their Master's degree on their way to Ph.D. (hopefully by the end of this academic year). Though I have not yet published to any peer-reviewed journals, the work I do this year will likely be the foundation for my first publications and I will be attending conferences soon. That being said, I have had my fair share of networking at conferences (outside of my field) and been given business cards, but very rarely have I ever seen a business card from someone in my own field! My program encourages many strategies that will help fellow scholars find me online to contact me, but regarding business cards, I have been given various answers. Most of my mentors seem to think that surely business cards are important, however, it seems that they only become imperative after I have started to publish my research, i.e. give people a reason to need my business card. </p>

<p>As of now, passing out my card at a conference would only serve to introduce my research interests.. which have not yet been conducted and it will take 1-2+ years before I am out in the field, producing this research. Moreover, the conferences I attend within the next 1-2 years are geared towards introducing graduate students to panels and whatnot, and it is unlikely that their research interests will substantially align with my own. Even more perplexing - I have met students in my field that are far more experienced than myself but are not concerned with business cards whatsoever at this early stage of their career, but I have also met students with my same level of expertise who hand out their card often.</p>

<p>Provided this information, when should I start seriously considering business cards? To what extent would my business card matter to you personally, and if it does not matter much because I am so early on in my career, at one point do you suggest taking business cards more seriously? As of now, my business card would likely list my occupation as ""graduate student"" or ""teaching fellow,"" which do not seem substantial enough to purchase cards in bulk.. especially when my occupation will change, as I progress in my program. Any and all advice is welcome, as well as personal anecdotes regarding one's experience with the timing of obtaining their own business cards!</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the first case, the authors cite a paper of mine where I compare two different methods to calculate elastic properties of materials. My main conclusion is that one of the methods converges much faster than the other one with the size of the basis set - in other words, it's computationally much cheaper. For calculations with usual basis sets the first method is much more accurate than the second one, with disagreements between the two in the order of 10% or even 20%. They claim that I show that both methods agree within a 1% of each other, which is misleading at best, because for the second method to agree within 1% of the first one one needs to do a very expensive calculation. That is one of the main points of the paper and it got completely overlooked by the authors.</p></li>

How do I politely tell a student to take a shower?,"<p>There's a student in my class who obviously has some serious body hygeine issues. To preface, this is a fairly packed class -- about 60 students in a small lecture room.  The class is about 2 hours long. The problem has been so bad that when the student comes up to ask a question the stench hits hard. The problem is so bad lately that in the past month, people will leave a seat distance away from this one person, even standing up for the entirety of the lecture just to avoid sitting next to this person when the only seats available are next to the person. </p>

<p>I don't know how to approach him and to ask that they take care of their body. Or will I be a prude if I do try to get him to shower? Maybe it's a unique body issue that he can't fix (unlikely), but I really want to solve this before exams come up, which are going to cause issues. No one has come up to talk to me privately about it but the problem is incredibly obvious.</p>

",137293,17-09-2019 22:25,How to approach a student with bad hygiene?,"<p>I teach engineering at a community college in the US. I currently have a student with very poor hygiene. He stinks pretty badly, has obviously greasy hair, doesn’t change his clothes frequently, and I usually seat him in the back of the room (during exams and labs, when I have power over seating arrangements) so I don’t have to smell his (relatively strong) body odor.</p>

<p>This student has also spoken with a colleague of mine about his low self-esteem. He’s worried that he isn’t making friends, and doesn’t know if the people he hangs out with are hanging out with him because they want something from him (help with classwork) or because they are truly friends. </p>

<p>In my opinion, this student follows me around like a puppy, and he tries too hard to impress people (students and faculty alike). I am a young-ish female faculty member and I try to create very large boundaries, especially with my male students. As an example, he frequently finds the need to explain to me (in way too much detail) why he gets questions wrong on exams (I don’t care, and I don’t need to know, which I’ve told him several times with no success).</p>

<p>So, I would like to mention to this student that his hygiene is off-putting and isn’t helping him out in the friends department. However, because he already follows me around like a puppy dog, I don’t want to encourage any more interaction from him. Additionally, it frankly embarrasses me to have to bring up hygiene issues with somebody in their late teens / early twenties.

<p>I was hoping that I would be finished up with this student by now, but I am the only professor who teaches Electrical Engineering courses, so I can’t recommend that he take classes with someone else, or ask another colleague to discuss this with him.

Taking an extra semester to raise GPA,"<p>I'm not sure if this is the place to ask about graduate admission, so please let me know if the question is off-topic.</p>

<p>I'm currently in my senior year doing my undergraduate degree. I recently made the decision to pursue graduate studies (M.S. CS), but my GPA is a bit low. I will graduate with a double major degree in international relations and computer science. My major GPA will be 3.1/4.0 (cumulative 3.3/4.0), and so I decided to delay graduation an take another semester to raise my GPA (retaking a couple of courses and taking one new one) and also give me more time to prepare for graduate admission as I felt I was a bit too unprepared. After the extra semester (and assuming I do average to well) my major GPA will be 3.4/4.0.</p>

<p>I took the GRE and did well (163V / 169Q / 5.5 AW), but felt that I want to invest as much effort as I can (since this is the only time I'll have, to raise my undergraduate GPA) and then apply when I'm better prepared.</p>

<p>Does graduating late reflect poorly for graduate admission? I wanted to use that time and take advantage of the fact that I'm taking fewer courses during the semester to work on other projects as well.</p>

<p>Any feedback is appreciated. Thank you!</p>

Diversity Statement for Faculty Position in the US?,"<p>I am crafting applications for US faculty positions and Californian universities require diversity statements. Now, the problem is I have no idea what to write in it, since diversity can mean literally anything. I've seen various examples that are all based on personal struggles by people belonging to minority groups or active in some program related to mentoring/teaching to minorities, which makes writing such a statement much easier.</p>

<p>Now, I've never been involved in any ""program"" of this type. There's no research/teaching about minorities in my field (science). I'm no minority, since I'm a white european. I've lived here and there for various years (outside of my homeland) in my early life and to work these last 5-6 years, so I'm technically an emigrant, but I guess it'd be offensive to people emigrating due to serious reasons to pick on this to develop the statement.</p>

<p>I was wondering whether anybody can give me a solid to develop something tasteful. I thought about something about multidisciplinarity since I've worked and studied in various fields, but I think the purpose of such statement is to address racial/gender/sex diversity.</p>

Does telling students to take notes in high school really help them learn better?,"<p>I don't feel like it actually helped me. I now sense long after high school that taking notes and reading them probably did not help. Now I understand why it could work. In theory, somebody who thinks for themself could use their own method of trying to understand the parts of a lecture they are interested in understanding, using a complex method writing down the results of what they figured out about their method of thinking and slowly improving their own method of thinking and writing. However, when I was in high school, I didn't understand why I was told to takes notes so I used linear thinking and just copied down what ever the teacher was writing on the board and then read my notes and I'm not sure it really helped.</p>

What I haven't seen though is any study that has asked if we should even be taking notes in the first place.</p>

<p>Specifically I would like to know the long-term effects of taking notes vs not taking notes. It is clear to me that if someone has taken notes their entire academic career, then immediately stops, their performance will probably plummet, but how do students who have never taken notes compare to students who have always taken notes?</p>

<p>I would guess certain learning styles would benefit from note-taking while other learning styles are hindered by note-taking, but I would like to see some actual data on this if anyone knows anything about it. A cursory Google search didn't return anything, so I hope there is someone on here that may be able to shed some light on this.</p>

<p>Edit: A lot of people have taken this question to solely be asking for research on this topic. While I would most like to see actual data, I did not intend this to solely be a literature search, and people can post their anecdotal evidence, as long as it is pointed at the long-term difference in note-taking vs not taking notes.</p>

What is a recommended strategy on exercises in a mathematical textbook at graduate level?,"<p>When I read a mathematical textbook at graduate level to learn and master a particular subject that I am unfamiliar with, I always struggle with the strategy on the exercises. Sometimes I spent one hour on one exercise problem without making any progress. Sometimes I skip exercise problems with guilt and worried that I may not have learnt the material well. I can think of the following possible strategies on exercises:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ignore all of them. Just focus on reading the main body of the textbook.</li>
<li>Set a time limit. Say for every hour I spent on reading the main body, I spent twice much time on solving exercise problems. I try to solve whatever I can within two hours and skip the rest.</li>
<li>Never move on to a new session unless I have solved all exercise problems in the previous session. If I get stuck, spend hours working on it and if still no success, look it up or ask somebody until I understand the solution.</li>
<li>Spend a reasonable amount of time on each problem and if I could not solve it, read the solution from a solution manual. This strategy seldom works as for most books on graduate level, solution manuals are unavailable.</li>
</ol>

My question is about citing  Wikipedia for something that is, by contrast, unrelated to the core subject matter of the paper, and thus is trivial in the sense of being unimportant rather than trivial in the sense of being common or basic knowledge.</p>

<p>Many previous questions on this site touch on citing Wikipedia, but none of them seem to me to address this specific issue.</p>

<p>I am writing a statistics paper. The focus and original work of the paper is abstract and theoretical. To introduce some of those ideas, I have a silly little thought experiment involving golf, and choosing which properties one wants one's club to have.</p>

<p>To be clear, nothing about the paper's actual focus is relevant to golf. The golf example is just a helpful, concrete way to introduce the perspective I am taking in the paper on certain statistical techniques.</p>

<p>To flesh out this example, I need to be able to describe the various options one has when choosing a golf club (head material, shaft length, etc.). I have learned from Wikipedia everything I need to know about these options in order to describe my silly little thought experiment. Would it be inappropriate to cite Wikipedia in a case like this? Would reviewers/readers raise an eyebrow at my doing so? Do I really need to spend time reading primary sources on various golf head materials just to be able to include this silly thought experiment in my paper?</p>

<p>Edit: Ok, there have been many responses. Most with a firm ""no"", but some giving the reason: ""Just get the proof from a book"" since it's so common, but suppose then it wasn't a common proof of something. Maybe it's not very well known or something but suppose there is a small Wikipedia page with the correct mathematical proof. How much effort are people going to go to to find a proof in a book when there's a (correct (which we know, becuase it's maths and we can check it)) proof on Wikipedia? Why is it so bad to say: ""I found this proof on Wikipedia, and the maths checks out so it doesn't matter who wrote it, it is correct, but that's where I found it.""

What to expect when pursuing a second doctorate in an unrelated field,"<p>Long story short: I got a PhD a few years ago (let's say, in numerical methods for nonlinear PDEs).  I've since gotten experience with a couple post-docs and a variety of collaborators, but I'm not really satisfied with what I'm doing.  I feel out of place.</p>

<p>Earlier in life, I made a tough decision between science and humanities-- my other passion has always been, let's say, east Asian languages.  If my bachelors program had had better language courses or options for ""hybrid"" fields like computational linguistics, I probably would have gone that route, instead of fully focusing on math.</p>

<p>I've sought out collaborations that might help me bridge the gap between math and languages; I've also looked at postdocs to help make the transition.  I've reached out to leaders at research groups who do stuff I'm really interested in.  The common denominator is: I'd need a PhD in some kind of linguistics to research seriously what I want. So...</p>

<p><strong>What key things should I take into consideration when pursuing a doctorate, given that I have a doctorate in an unrelated field?</strong></p>

<p>Please consider the question within the following context: I'm <strong>not</strong> asking whether having two PhDs is good or bad (I frankly don't care), how to needlessly pad my name with titles, or how to get two PhDs simultaneously. (That is all to say: <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/17232/is-doing-two-phds-a-good-path/17245#17245"">this post</a> doesn't answer my question.)  I'm asking about what to expect when changing careers, specifically, if the source career is in one academic field and the target career is in another, unrelated field.  Assume I've 100% decided to leave my current field and pursue this second doctorate, for the purpose of changing careers. Assume also that I already have substantial content knowledge in the target field, as I have a bachelors degree in it already, and it's been an avid hobby for most of my life.</p>

<p>Some sub-questions that don't need to be specifically answered, but I think help narrow the question: in what way could my current PhD be a hindrance in getting into a new program?  Will my supervisors and colleagues see my past PhD as an asset, or as weird-looking mole they will try to politely ignore?  What are other questions should I ask myself to prepare for such a non-traditional career path?</p>

Acceptability of 'not possible' for master thesis research,"<p>I am currently working on my (Computer Science) master thesis, and have been doing so now for about 5-6 months. The default time for thesis work at my university is about 9 months. Aspects such as literature review and 'planning' were all approved and went very smoothly.</p>

<p>Slowly I am realizing that the method I have planned to develop is simply not going to work. To be a bit more clear: I have thought of a model to solve a problem that isn't currently solved, and have found that my model doesn't improve on any of the exisiting 'attempted' models nor does it contribute anything 'useful' to the industry other than 'this model doesn't work.'</p>

<p>My question being: is it acceptable for the conclusion of a master thesis aiming to implement a new model for a problem to be 'doesn't work?'</p>

Racial Classification in US College Admissions Process,"<p>Elite U.S. universities are known to have affirmative action policies based on race and sex (and maybe religion?), in an effort to promote diversity.</p>

<p>I wonder how they can classify applicants based on race, given that it is sometimes difficult to clearly identify or prove one's race.</p>

<p>Is there a checkbox dedicated to race on an application form? For example, can a child of an Asian mother and a black farther choose to be categorized as black so as to improve the chance of admission?</p>

<p>I am asking these questions purely out of curiosity because I was born, raised and educated in Japan, a rather homogeneous society where no official records on race are kept.</p>

<p>I wonder the U.S. registry keeps residents' races, so it is relatively easy for Americans to obtain official documents proving their races.</p>

<p>As for religion, I guess it is even more difficult to obtain official documents. So, do applicants discretionally select their religions without the need to prove it, or does the U.S. government have religious records on its citizens? If applicants are free to choose, some unscrupulous individuals can choose a minority religion that gives a better chance, regardless of their true faith?</p>

<p>I have no idea about international applicants. Outside the U.S., it is very difficult and sometime impossible to officially prove one's race or religion, so the U.S. college admissions committee considers nationality only in the screening process?</p>

Why is the citation system so archaic?,"<p>I am puzzled why citation is still so archaic for academic research papers.</p>

<p>It seems to me that all you need to cite a journal or a textbook is three things</p>

<ol>
<li>Names of the authors</li>
<li>Date of publication</li>
<li>Title of the work (and edition number if there is any)</li>
</ol>

<p>To be honest, nowadays, just a url would suffice.</p>

<p>But any standard template requires you several additional, and seemingly unnecessary information, such as the publisher, which bothers me no end as these publishers change their names every few years.</p>

<p>What is more irrational is the inclusion of where the text is printed. Is it New York, Toronto, Cham, Mumbai, ""Upper Saddle-River"". What difference does it make? None.</p>

<p>Furthermore, some old journals or books are completely out of print, and the only thing that exist now is a PDF copy somewhere. So it doesn't even make sense to cite publishers, etc. The book is out of print!</p>

<p>Why is the citation system so archaic and time-consuming in a time where ALL your references are literally just one single click away? Why not require URL for all cited journals, textbooks, etc? </p>

<p>In my opinion the most important characteristic of a citation is that it uniquely identifies a given publication and makes it as easy as possible to access it. This, however, is usually already given by title, authors and, if applicable, the title of the collection (proceedings, journal...). If available, a DOI alone would be sufficient for that.</p>

<p>As secondary feature, further details provide more information about the properties of a publication without the need to look them up explicitly. For example, the year is usually very interesting to assess the timeliness of the related work.</p>

<p>Neither the name nor the address of the publisher seems to fall in one of these categories, even though it might be reasonable for example for some exotic books that are otherwise hard to find*. For this reason I usually omit the publisher's name and address in citations, partly to keep them brief, partly since I am not aware <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/q/116372/61201"">who the publisher actually is</a>, partly because others in my area of research (CS) do the same, partly because I am too lazy to put work into something that seems superfluous to me. Sometimes, however, the publishers and their addresses are added during copy editing, so there seem to be at least some people with a different opinion than me.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it considered bad academic practice to omit the publisher and the address?</li>
<li>What are other advantages or disadvantages?</li>
<li>Does it depend on the type of the cited publication? Books might be different from articles in journals or conference proceedings.</li>
<li>Does it depend on the type of the publication I write? In a short paper, brevity might be more important than in a PhD thesis where accuracy is essential. What about a publication list in a CV?</li>
<li>Does it depend on the area of research? Maybe we computer scientists are just lazy?</li>

Should I ask potential recommenders whether they know someone?,"<p>Let's say someone is applying for a PhD or postdoc position (or a number of such positions), and needs to decide who should write a recommendation letter. Assume that two letters are needed, but the person has four professors to choose from. All four professors say that they are comfortable with writing a strong letter.</p>

How to reject a PhD Scholarship offer after accepting it?,"<p>I have accepted a scholarship at a certain university, after exchanging many emails with the supervisor. I was interviewed by him and he personally took trouble to secure funding for me. And he also helped me a lot throughout the process. But now I have received a better offer from a better university, which has a better research group.</p>

<p>Now I am not sure how to email my supervisor rejecting the offer, after accepting it months back. It seems a really unethical thing to do. But considering all the other aspects, the second university seems to be the ideal choice for me.</p>

<p>How should I reject the first offer without offending my supervisor?</p>
",98523,07-11-2017 13:53,Rejecting a PhD offer after having accepted it. Advice?,"<p>I have accepted a PhD offer from a very good university to do a project very close to my interests. I have told the project supervisor I accept it. In the meanwhile I have managed to secure a PhD offer from another 2 universities much better in world rankings and with better research groups and better faculty. Additionally these 2 universities do research exactly on what I want to devote my PhD research.</p>

<p>My only commitment to the first university is a mail confirming I accept. Nothing else. I understand declining the offer after already having accepted it is quite dishonest but it is a huge decision that will affect my future in a very significant level. </p>

<p>I would like your opinion and I would also like to ask for possible consequences of such an action. As far a postdocs concerned, in the first university there is no chance I ever get a postdoc since they do not actually do research on my area (except for the prospective supervisor and even he not as much).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
I have decided to do as I was afraid to. I have decided to choose a different university than the first one that I have already accepted the offer. My offer acceptance included: </p>

<ul>
<li>An online ""I accept"" statement.</li>
<li>An e-mail I sent stating ""I accept the scholarship and this University is my first option""</li>
</ul>

<p>I do not have any legal commitments since I have not signed anything. The supervisor of the first university though is really nice to me and continuously was sending me mails. <strong>How do I very nicely tell her I will not be joining in the end?</strong> Additionally the place I will go in the end will be for research in Mathematics and not Physics. Can I use this as a part of a sensical excuse?</p>

<p><strong>WHAT I HAVE CHOSEN AND WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES WERE</strong></p>

<p>I think that I should let people, especially other beginning grad students know what happened with my case. I have chosen to nicely tell the first university I got accepted that I will not be attending and will not be pursuing a PhD there since I decided I have different research interests (which is true). I had applied there in the first place since I was not sure what I wanted to do and because it was a nice program. Despite that, I got an offer from a World top university to work on 100% my research interests. I explained this to them, the first uni, and they happily let me go and wished me good luck, especially the supervisor who faught a lot secure me funding. I was lucky.</p>

   more.</p>

",99561,28-11-2017 13:04,How should I deal with becoming discouraged as a graduate student?,"<p>I am a third year (starting fourth year in the fall) PhD student in mathematics. I've passed all qualifying exams and am currently doing research. As far as I can tell, I am not doing poorly. I have the good fortune of having a great advisor, being in a very supportive department, and having friends and family who genuinely care about my success. </p>

<p>The fact is research is hard. It appears to consist primarily of staring at a problem for days and days and days without getting anywhere. Sometimes, rarely, I do figure something out and that feels wonderful, but the overwhelming majority of my time appears to be spent banging my head against a mostly figurative wall. I am not complaining about the material being hard, and I am not averse to putting in hard work, but I get frequently discouraged when I realize the vast volumes of mathematics that I yet know nothing about (and probably never will). It's very hard to quantify progress - in particular, there are too few tangible returns after too many hours worked. I find myself thinking along the lines of ""Oh, if only someone actually smart were thinking about this problem they would have solved it in moments"" and so on. </p>

<p>I've talked about this to some number of people; here is some advice I have received:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take a day off. Putting in hours upon hours of trying things doesn't magically lead to a solution, particularly if the brain is tired and just wants to sleep.</li>
<li>Have a hobby. Since math research doesn't exactly provide instant gratification, a hobby might provide some instead. </li>
<li>Talk to other graduate students. Realize that many graduate students go through this.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm interested to know how other folks have dealt with being discouraged as a graduate student. Does it get better with time and experience? Is this a sign that research is not for me and that I should seriously consider a life outside academia?</p>

TA struggling with how much time grading takes,"<p>This semester I was assigned as a TA to a Class that I am not very familiar with.
As a result, grading takes me too much time.
For example, for a class of 74 people, it took me 24 hours to grade their assignments (7 exercises per person). One of the reasons it takes me that much time is that I have to study in order to refresh the content in my head before grading.</p>

Should I tell my concerns to the professor I am TA for and as well as my PhD supervisor ? I fear I might seem lazy or unproductive.</p>

<p>Is it too late to ask for a co-supervisor at the end of first year? I have a professor in mind who I'd like to ask, and he is someone I already know, but since it's quite late in the year I am wondering if it is appropriate to even ask. (And I'd definitely consult my current supervisor first. He'd probably be ok with it).</p>

"PhD. in the US directly after European BSc., or is it better to go for a MSc. at first?","<p>I'm currently in the final year of my BSc. in physics and the second year of my BSc. in mathematics at a university in german-speaking Europe. I'll have my degrees finished in summer 2018.</p>
<p>Eventually, I'd like to end up in theoretical or mathematical physics research (most probably gravitational physics) and would love to experience some time at a foreign university. Firstly, since my university is stronger in the experimental field and has a relatively small theory group and secondly for the sake of broadening my horizon. The US (or generally Northern America) would be particularly interesting, because of the somewhat &quot;more open&quot; research culture, in comparison to a highly bureaucratic and kind of inert (and often poorly financed) apparatus in german-speaking part of Europe (and probably in the whole EU - at least that's my naive perception of it, or am I wrong in this?).</p>
<p>I read that the PhD. in the US is a bit different to the one in Europe, e.g.  that a MSc. is kind of integrated in the coursework-heavy first one or two years of a US PhD. Nevertheless, there are some interesting MSc. programs in Europe, e.g. in Edinburgh or at the ETH in Zurich.</p>
<p>So, my questions would be (from a rational/scientific-career point of view):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it reasonable to go for a PhD. <strong>directly</strong> after a BSc. in the US? Or would it be more sensible to pursue a MSc. in Europe first and only then head for a PhD. in the US?</p>
<p>Small side question for physicists since I'm just researching into this: Which universities in Northern America have a strong gravitational physics department (aside from Stanford and Princeton)?</p>

<p>So I am wondering if it makes sense to go to the US for PhD, since I will have already a master's degree in two years. I read a lot about the US PhD's which can be started after bachelor and therefore are somehow like a European master &amp; PhD combined. </p>

<p>I saw some PhD programmes from well-known US universities and their curriculum contained almost just courses I will already have in my master. Wouldn't that be a waste of time to repeat them? Specially compared to my country (Switzerland) where a PhD duration is between 3-4 years.</p>

Is studying past exams I found online cheating?,"<p>I had an exam this morning. Last week the teacher had warned us that her exams are tough; this scared me. I wanted to see what her exams were like, so to study I searched through the exam repository at my school for an old midterm. Unfortunately, the exam repository only has final exams (including this course). Then I googled ""(course code) (school name) midterm"", and a couple of links came up. One was an online repository (not associated with my school) where people can upload old exams. I found a lot of old midterms for this course. These midterms were all in the same format but the exact questions were different in most cases. These midterms also had the answer key. I studied them to get an idea of how much the professor expected of us and to help resolve my confusion about some concepts. The practice midterms REALLY helped clarify things for me. </p>

<p>Last night, a student in the class posted a past midterm in a student-run Facebook group for the class. This exam did not have the official answers on it, but it did have the ones given by the student who took the test that year. After taking the test today, I noticed that some of the questions on this midterm were identical to the ones I studied online. It dawned on me that I may have committed an academic offense.</p>

<p>I am wondering, is studying past exams given in the course cheating? What if those exams are found in an non-school-sponsored repository online?</p>
",78882,27-10-2016 03:30,"Is it ethical to use past years' final exams that the professor hasn't explicitly given, to study for a final in the same class?","<p>This happened to me in my 2nd year of grad school, in a STEM field. As many do, our professor gave the class the last year's final, to give us an idea of what areas to study and what to expect, etc, which he obviously isn't required to do and is very nice of him.</p>

<p>Now, the reason he gives us last year's one is because, at the end of the year, he returns your test, so he knows that most of the ones floating around are the ones from last year.</p>

<p>However, as many older professors (in my experience, but maybe younger ones too) do, he also reuses exams from previous years (not even concepts or the same problems with different parameters, just literal copies), since the material and curriculum of this course is very well established/so old that nothing needs to change. I don't blame him for this; if you teach the same course on and off over 20 years, coming up with good exam questions over and over again would be annoying.</p>

<p>Now, what my question regards is, I realized a student in my class had past tests from not just the last time the class was taught, but literally the past 5 years. I don't know how to say this part as diplomatically as possible, but this student came from a country that about nearly half our program comes from. The other half (aside a few outliers) is from the U.S. I don't mention this to demonize or stereotype anyone; I believe it's relevant because the students from this country (in my program) are almost uniformly very tight knit, and seem to often share resources between each other and across years more than is normal amongst everyone else. The relevance is that one group has resources that others don't.</p>

<p>So my question is, is this ethical (for the student to do, I mean) ?</p>

<p>Just to put some relevant ideas/arguments/details down:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assume (and I believe it was the case) that in the scenario I've written, the rest of the students (the ones who <em>don't</em> have the past tests) don't know about the students that have the past tests, so they can't do something simple like ask them.</li>
<li>I think many will argue that if the professor didn't want this happening, he wouldn't reuse tests, or at least as exactly as he does. However, I don't think this changes the ethics of the situation: the point is, in this situation, you <em>can</em> get away with it, but is it right?</li>
<li>I imagine the professor would not approve of this (actually, recently, another professor said in regards to his final ""I know there are past ones floating around, please don't look at them"", so at least he disapproved), but an argument could also be made for the possibility of him approving: It's not as though having the previous tests just makes it a given that you'll ace it, it's still a lot of work to figure out all the problems such that you can reliably do them later (he doesn't give back the <em>answers</em> to the tests, only the tests themselves). I could imagine a professor being okay with students getting a better grade on the final if it meant they learned more and worked to get it.</li>
<li>This professor never actually said not to, so the student wasn't explicitly disobeying anyone.</li>
<li>This question really has two subquestions, but they're very similar: a) Would it be ethical if <em>everyone</em> had these pasts tests (that the professor did not know about/give)? And b), Is it ethical if only a subset of the class has these tests. Obviously if you say no to (a) you say no to (b), but you might feel as though the concept of using past tests isn't wrong, but some students having an unfair advantage is.</li>

<li>they choose a group of experts as founders and/or chief editors, </li>
<li>they determine a scope and some basic rules for the journal, </li>
<li>they decide about the number of issues in each year and similar things, </li>
<li>they find a publisher or decide to publish the journal entirely on web, they establish a web site for the journal, </li>
<li>and then they announce the new journal in the related scientific community. </li>
</ul>

<p>Did I miss any stage? But I suspect there are lots of discussions, negotiations, arrangements and cooperations behind the curtain, which public (the rest of the related scientific community) doesn't know. So my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is a typical procedure for establishing a respectful academic journal? </li>
<li>Do financial considerations play a key role? </li>
<li>Should the founders be top experts (to some degree) in the field? </li>
<li>Is it important the new journal be affiliated to a scientific society or be published by a recognized publisher? </li>
<li>Why are some new journals published only on-line?  </li>
<li>What are the influential factors for the success of a new journal? </li>
<li>How do the founders choose the editors? </li>
<li>What else should one consider for initiating a new academic journal?</li>

Double PhD: is it really worth it?,"<p>Is it possible to have a double PhD even if the university you are originally applying for doesn't focus on this category? A double PhD is not the same thing as two PhDs. For example, the medical school at the University of Groningen describes its <a href=""https://www.groningenbiomed.com/research-and-funding/faqs/double-degree-phd-programs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">double PhD program</a> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Double Degree (DD) PhD means that you will obtain your PhD degree from two different institutions, i.e. a double diploma, sometimes also referred to as a ""dual award"". A double degree (two diplomas, each of which issued by a single university) should not be confused with a ""joint degree"" (one diploma issued by multiple institutions).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm applying for a PhD position on a university and it does not have a explicit double PhD program (although I know there are some people on another field that held a double PhD from this same university). However, this double PhD degree would be very helpful to me considering my future plans. </p>

<p>From this, I was wondering: could I receive a double PhD if I find a second advisor from another university? Or the universities need to be associated upfront? In this case, if the university I'm apply on does not have an explicit double PhD program, it is possible (for legal issues of diploma printing) to just associate with another university?</p>

<p>My second question is: for an advisor, what is the advantages of having a part-time student? For last, the thesis needs to be approved for both universities... how this happens? I would have to present for both?</p>

",80035,17-11-2016 11:29,Average time alloted for manuscript review across disciplines,"<p>I am asking this question because I've always had the impression that manuscripts submitted to a journal in my field (theoretical linguistics) take an <em>insanely long time</em> to get published, and sometimes I get the impression that this is because, most of the time, nobody other than the author cares about getting things done within a reasonable amount of time. Some examples from personal experience follow.</p>

<ul>
<li>For the last paper I submitted before getting my PhD, I had to wait nine months from the submission date to get reviews back from the referees.</li>
<li>Last week I got a review request from a journal I had never reviewed for previously. The review deadline is March 15 (almost four months).</li>
<li>In early October, I submitted a manuscript to a journal that I know asks reviewers to return reviews within 6 weeks. I checked the status of the manuscript online and it still says ""with editor"".</li>
<li>Earlier this year, I was about to start writing a review when my wife went into labor. By the time we came back from the hospital, I had forgotten about the review, so I missed the deadline. The editor didn't contact me to ask about the review until two months after the deadline.</li>
<li>Late in 2013, I was asked to write a survey chapter for a handbook. The expected publication date of the handbook is summer 2016.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this is not me being unlucky with editors and referees. In private conversations through the years, many colleagues have confirmed that it is virtually unheard of to get reviews back within 3 months of submission; 5 or 6 months seems to be a good average, but in some cases it can take longer (see my first point above). In general, everybody seems to have accepted that the submission-to-printed-journal process is going to take a bare minimum of one year, and that's assuming that the manuscript is accepted without revisions. If revisions are required, two years is not out of the question. Also, it's not like our papers are ridiculously long. I've reviewed about 100 papers so far, and the longest one was about 50 single-space pages; 30-35 single-spaced pages is closer to average.</p>

<p>I remember that, when I was a postdoc, my astrophysics housemate mentioned that in his field the entire submission-to-printed-journal process took only three or four months. I really can't see a good reason why theoretical linguistics shouldn't operate on similar timeframes, other than the fact that everybody seems to have grown used to things taking way longer than they really need to. What are the wait times in other fields? How do you manage to get things done quickly?</p>

Would it be rude to remind them about this?</p>

<p>Oddly I've talked to the editor sometimes before sending my manuscript and she was always quick to reply, so I guess this status has to do with looking for another editor specialized in that field or for reviewers?
I fear this may cut down chances for paper to get published.</p>

The same day I received in my e-mail an acknowledgement saying that the paper had been received.</p>

<p>The problem is that the status of the paper on the online submission system is still ""Manuscript submitted"".</p>

<p>I think this means that the paper has not even been assigned to an editor yet (once this happens, the editor will probably start looking for reviewers), but as far as I know submissions are assigned to editors within a few weeks (I once submitted a paper to another journal and when an editor had been assigned, the status on the online system changed to ""Editor handles"" or something like that).</p>

<p>I know that publishing is a long and complicated process and I'm not trying to rush anybody, but sometimes manuscripts are lost in the system. In fact, this has once happened to me, so I just want to make sure that the paper was not lost in the system.</p>

Post-Bac Program Help Low GPA,"<p>I'm an undergraduate student studying computer science in my last year. I graduate in Spring 2017. I have a 2.97 GPA. I will likely have a 3.0-3.1 when I graduate. I want to end up at a top university for grad school and dream of being a researching professor.</p>

<p>I recently was able to speak in person with a new assistant professor from a top school at a conference recently about working with him through an RA or post-bac position. We got along well and he enjoyed my ideas as I did his. It <em>seems</em> like we fit well as people (which is important, I'd say). We're still corresponding via email.</p>

<p>The RA position is up in the air until he files the grant for it so until then my only viable option to work with this professor is through this post-bac program.</p>

<p><strong>Here's my dilemma:</strong> </p>

<p>I'm concerned my GPA and lack of a strong 'rising trend' will outright prevent my acceptance to this post-bac program. And if the RA position isn't an option, there goes my chance at getting networked into this top school for now. I know this isn't the whole truth and that it's a more nuanced situation but I can't help feeling this way sometimes. </p>

<p><strong>Here are my questions:</strong> </p>

<ol>
<li><p>How helpful is it to get into top post-bac programs for low-GPA students if they:
<strong>a.</strong> Already have correspondence with a faculty 
<strong>b.</strong> Have already spoken about possible projects with that professor that both parties agree are good 
<strong>c.</strong> The professor mentioned he'd ""make sure [my] application gets considered in full"" 
<strong>d.</strong> Contact the Director of the program mentioning the correspondence with the professor and the student's concerns about their GPA/application</p></li>
<li><p>How hard is it to get into top post-bac problems?
<strong>a.</strong> Are they competitive?
<strong>b.</strong> How many people apply knowing faculty ahead of time?
<strong>c.</strong> How many people apply usually?</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Some Info That (may) Hurt My Application:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>GPA = 2.97, will likely be 3.0-3.1 at graduation</li>
<li>No significant 'rising trend' in grades after sophomore/junior year - I've genuinely been a B student because I didn't care for classes until I cam across A.I. Two years later I now know in my heart this is my calling and I want to be a professor as well. In a way, I believe this passion cured my depression (see below)</li>

<li>Multiple failed courses in my transcripts in my first year (Failed college algebra three times because I had depression my first year; couldn't care about anything)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Some Info That (may) Help My Application:</strong></p>

<li>Major GPA > 3.2, will likely be > 3.3 at graduation</li>
<li>Invested in research in the field (A.I.) I'm going into with this prof at the uni where the post-bac</li>
<li>The research I'm doing is possibly groundbreaking. PI mentioned in last meeting ""This has the potential to be material for multiple PhD dissertations""</li>
<li>I'm the primary and only author aside from the PI on that project</li>
<li>My outreach is beyond excellent by all standards (founded multiple advanced STEM organizations, am an avid public speaker on STEM [more than 6 talks/lectures in the city], and recently started a lecture series for students at my uni on AI that was funded by MIT for the Fall 2016 semester) (and there's more outreach I'm not listing)</li>
<li>I'm hispanic and will be the second person in my family to get an advanced degree </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My Current Plan</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Contact the Director of the post-bac program, mention my concerns, see how I can make my last few months as useful as possible for acceptance</li>
<li>Mention to the Director my correspondence with the assistant professor</li>
<li>Keep corresponding with the professor about topics and reinforce the idea I'm worth his time</li>

I am currently in a master's program and asked her if she would be willing to write me a letter of recommendation for upcoming PhD applications for next Fall (and it is worth noting that she wrote me a letter of recommendation for the program I am currently in). She has yet to reply and having a letter from her would really strengthen my application. Is it in poor taste to resend her an email, or should I move on?

<p>When a textbook author approaches a topic in a novel way or presents a particularly interesting example, I believe that a teacher who creates lecture notes using this novel approach or interesting example would be doing the right thing to cite the originator of the approach or the example.  Similarly, whenever I copy a clever (and clearly unique) problem from a textbook and give it as a question in an exam or an assignment, I try my best to indicate (in the exam or assignment paper itself) the source of the original problem.</p>

<p>My question is now what is the best approach to sending a <em>second</em> reminder to a professor concerning writing an LOR? A couple months ago, after having discussed my graduate school plans with the professor, they agreed to write his letter and have me send them the e-mail link to the LOR. I sent the first reminder last week, but they did not respond. And this professor is normally responsive in e-mails about other things, such as coursework and advising. I suspect the professor is beyond busy, and I hope that is the case; I just hope they haven't forgotten about the LOR or changed their mind about it.</p>

<p>I would like to add further that my two other recommenders have already submitted their LORs. I am still waiting on this professor now. Should I mention this in my second reminder e-mail to them, if I should send that second reminder at all? What should I be saying in the e-mail, to politely remind them for the second time?</p>

Supervisor discourages me from using a method he doesn't know. Can I work on it and publish it by myself?,"<p>Either my supervisor is wrong in not letting me work on an idea which he does not understand, my bad that I am  stuck with someone who is not open-minded. But I suck it up.</p>

<p>But I am enthusiastic about the idea and wish to work on it myself. I can find time for it and it is very useful for my future opportunities. My supervisor is not really worried about my future.</p>

<p>So firstly, how to manage this exercise by getting what I want, having no effect on my PhD and keeping my supervisor not too angry (after all my Phd is still influenced by this guy). Secondly, is it ok to write it up myself and publish it? I am not using any ideas from my supervisor for this work, of course the learning from previous works will be used - which is already published!</p>

What can I do?,"<p>I am doing a phd where my aim is to solve a problem A which is very interesting. My supervisor has got a lot of connections in a technology B and he claims to be an expert in B. I came to this group because of these accomplishments. But soon I realized that B is not really a great technology for A. </p>

<p>So in my phd proposal I proposed a method which encompasses B but is more general (say R). Now I realize that I do not want to use B at all because my preliminary results are not encouraging. In fact, I am inclined to use E as a base technique which does not have any impact on R.  But my supervisor, who is interested in only publishing in B  and frowns upon everything else (it was a nightmare to convince him to let me work on R) is dead against it. He says that he is an expert in B and his vision of the group is not inclined with me trying other things.</p>

<p>There are other professors in my university who have worked in E and could collaborate but my supervisor won't collaborate with people from outside his kingdom. I also know professors from outside my university who could help me if needed. I could knock the doors of school committee in order to  help me but that would create a lot of problems as my supervisor wields a lot of power and influence everywhere.  </p>

<p>Another query is, is it ethical to collaborate with people outside the university (of course after letting my supervisor know) for my PhD work. My Masters supervisor would be happy to help me out.</p>

<p>Edit: After looking at comments, I am thinking that after all, it is MY PhD. Yes, I have spent 1.5 years, but 1.5 years is left. Why should I spend any moment of my life on something I find to be not exciting, particularly less exciting because it is forced on me. And in those 1.5 years I learnt to write well and also learnt 'A' which is important. Its not total waste. My supervisor has his agenda, and why should I give up mine to make him happy? His vision is fine, but he does not have the right to force his vision on me.</p>

At what stage of computer science PhD should you start looking for post-doc?,"<p>I am exactly mid-way in my PhD in computer science. Is this the right time to start looking for a post doc?</p>
",80725,30-11-2016 03:41,How long before PhD graduation should I start applying for post-doc positions?,"<p>My earliest PhD graduation date is 10 months away. Funding permits me to stay 1–3 months longer, so the final date is still uncertain.</p>

<p>It is never too early to make contacts for possible post-docs. But how long in advance is too early to formally apply to post-doc job openings or funding opportunities? Depending on the bureaucracy, the path from applying to starting can probably be anything from a week up to a year — someone I know is applying with <a href=""http://www.esa.int/"">ESA</a> which had the opening advertised in August, application deadline in October, will have interviews in December/January, and the commencement of work only in September, 13 months after the initial job advertisement. My personal guess is that the long time between interviews and starting is to create a level playing field between those who do and those who don't need to go through a visa application procedure.</p>

<p>If I'm too early in applying for a post-doc, a hosting institution might prefer someone who can start earlier and where the graduation date is more certain. For example, in my case the graduation date is still uncertain, so there is a risk in accepting even if they are willing to wait. Project funding might also require the money to be spent rather soon.</p>

<p>If I wait too long, there might be a considerable period where I'm between jobs. Having a long (>6 months) period between jobs is a disadvantage for me. Maybe it's also a disadvantage for a hosting institution (I'm not sure).</p>

<p>How do I find the balance? For example, considering the duration of funding and visa applications, does it make sense to apply e.g. <a href=""http://www.vsp.ucar.edu/cgc/2013/2013_Program.html"">8 months in advance</a>? Or is it in any case virtually inevitable to have at least several months before my PhD graduation and the start of a post-doc?</p>

For reference, I've done poorly in a mathematics class and computer science class in my sophomore year (2 Cs, and a D in a genetics course, but that's unrelated to this project). Since then, I've gotten Bs in Calc III and Adv Calc (the only other courses relevant so far). </p>

<p>I finally sought help last spring and I've been doing better (keeping up with work, getting better grades, etc), but I feel like nothing will ever make up for those two years of mediocre grades. My overall GPA right now is sitting around a 2.5. I feel like while this is possible to explain away, I'm reluctant to divulge information about my severe mental illness to admissions because there is still a lot of stigma associated with it. I've seen mixed answers as to whether or not it's a good idea to do.</p>

<p>My question is, is there still a way for me to pursue applied mathematics in graduate school? Is graduate school aiming too high? And if so, do I talk about my limitations as far as my health is concerned? </p>

<p>I love math, and love learning. I've done a few practice Math Subject GRE exams, and they were fairly easy (as long as I study for the parts I'm not 100% on, of course). I've also done a few small math projects with grad students and I've worked in a lab since I was a freshman; I feel like I'm passionate enough about the subject to succeed but I'm afraid admission committees will not look past my GPA to see that and wouldn't risk having someone like me in their program.</p>

Why are some journals prestigious and others aren't?,"<p>What makes the journal ""prestigious"" in the first place? I can't myself find any sensible answer. </p>

<p>One candidate reason is that some journals have better reviewers. But reviewers are usually not paid, so <em>if</em> it were true that the good reviewers flock to these select few journals, they must be doing so because those journals were prestigious or attractive in some sense in the first place, and so we are back at our original question. </p>

<p>Another possible reason is that some journals only publish papers of a high quality. This seems wrong as well. For example, if I decided to create a journal which only published extreme-super-duper-mega-high quality papers, nobody would care about it. Rather it seems to be the other way around: these journals publish the best papers <em>because</em> they are prestigious and therefore receive the attention of the best academics and their best papers. So again, we are back at the original question. </p>

<p>A third reason could be readership, but, again, the readership is a consequence of the prestige the journal already possesses. We still don't know where it came from.</p>

Is deferred enrollment normal or acceptable to graduate programs? What are the acceptable reasons for it?,"<p>I am an undergraduate student majoring in computer science. I am currently doing graduate (Master's) program application for top US universities. </p>

<p>However, just now I get a pretty nice research assistant internship which requires me to work for them for one year.</p>

<p>I think I might take a gap year between my undergraduate and graduate study for the internship. But if I am accepted by the university I want to go, can I ask for a defer enrollment? I know I can reapply the next year, but despite the new research experience, my professor might refuse to write me reference letter again , the things might change (more applicants, less slots) and I might not be accepted the next year(I am also wondering will turning down an admission affect my application for the same program the next year). So I am thinking if I can use the defer enrollment to ""hold"" the admission.</p>

",82125,24-12-2016 05:10,Why would a grad school not want me to defer admission?,"<p>I have been accepted to a fairly competitive online computer science-related <a href=""http://datascience.berkeley.edu/"">graduate program</a> (in the US). It is a part-time program geared toward working professionals. During the application process, I was assigned an admissions counselor that worked with me during the application and answered questions, etc. The counselor did mention at one point that I could defer  admission by one trimester, should I be accepted.</p>

<p>Well, long story short, I have a situation with my employer (who would be funding my graduate studies), that is now making me strongly prefer to exercise the deferral option.</p>

<p>I have reached out to my admission counselor seeking guidance on how to do this. I expected this to be a fairly routine, straightforward process. Instead, I am getting aggressive pushback, with the counselor trying to talk me out of it. </p>

<p>After several emails and phone calls with the counselor, I still do not have any instructions on how to actually accept the admission but defer by one trimester. My admission offer is still pending. I would really like to simply accept the offer (and pay the deposits), but with deferral.</p>

<p>All I have are appointments to talk with a current student and a scheduled one-on-one demo of the ""courseware"" with the counselor. I cannot help but notice the counselor is seemingly dancing around my question on how to defer.</p>

<p>Since this deferral option was mentioned up front when I was still just an applicant, why would I be encountering this kind of resistance? I am truly baffled. Why can't I just do ""what is best for me""?</p>

<p>The program has three admission cycles throughout the year: fall, spring, and summer. I applied for fall 2015 and was accepted. I'd like to exercise the option to defer, essentially as if I applied for spring 2016.</p>

<p>I am starting to wonder: Does my request for a deferral reflect badly on someone? On me? On the counselor? Might the school have some aggressive revenue forecast that was expecting my tuition payment, and now this deferral request throws a wrench in it? Does the admission committee and/or counselor have some quota for accepted offers they need to meet? Might they simply be trying to balance class/cohort sizes? I am trying to understand this from the school and counselor's perspective: Why might they do this, and why do so in this aggressive manner?</p>

<p>Furtheremore, does anyone have any advice on how to proceed from this point? Should I just be frank and ask the counselor why the aggressive pushback?</p>

",82212,26-12-2016 07:39,Average time alloted for manuscript review across disciplines,"<p>I am asking this question because I've always had the impression that manuscripts submitted to a journal in my field (theoretical linguistics) take an <em>insanely long time</em> to get published, and sometimes I get the impression that this is because, most of the time, nobody other than the author cares about getting things done within a reasonable amount of time. Some examples from personal experience follow.</p>

<ul>
<li>For the last paper I submitted before getting my PhD, I had to wait nine months from the submission date to get reviews back from the referees.</li>
<li>Last week I got a review request from a journal I had never reviewed for previously. The review deadline is March 15 (almost four months).</li>
<li>In early October, I submitted a manuscript to a journal that I know asks reviewers to return reviews within 6 weeks. I checked the status of the manuscript online and it still says ""with editor"".</li>
<li>Earlier this year, I was about to start writing a review when my wife went into labor. By the time we came back from the hospital, I had forgotten about the review, so I missed the deadline. The editor didn't contact me to ask about the review until two months after the deadline.</li>
<li>Late in 2013, I was asked to write a survey chapter for a handbook. The expected publication date of the handbook is summer 2016.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this is not me being unlucky with editors and referees. In private conversations through the years, many colleagues have confirmed that it is virtually unheard of to get reviews back within 3 months of submission; 5 or 6 months seems to be a good average, but in some cases it can take longer (see my first point above). In general, everybody seems to have accepted that the submission-to-printed-journal process is going to take a bare minimum of one year, and that's assuming that the manuscript is accepted without revisions. If revisions are required, two years is not out of the question. Also, it's not like our papers are ridiculously long. I've reviewed about 100 papers so far, and the longest one was about 50 single-space pages; 30-35 single-spaced pages is closer to average.</p>

<p>I remember that, when I was a postdoc, my astrophysics housemate mentioned that in his field the entire submission-to-printed-journal process took only three or four months. I really can't see a good reason why theoretical linguistics shouldn't operate on similar timeframes, other than the fact that everybody seems to have grown used to things taking way longer than they really need to. What are the wait times in other fields? How do you manage to get things done quickly?</p>

I have the good fortune of having a great advisor, being in a very supportive department, and having friends and family who genuinely care about my success. </p>

<p>The fact is research is hard. It appears to consist primarily of staring at a problem for days and days and days without getting anywhere. Sometimes, rarely, I do figure something out and that feels wonderful, but the overwhelming majority of my time appears to be spent banging my head against a mostly figurative wall. I am not complaining about the material being hard, and I am not averse to putting in hard work, but I get frequently discouraged when I realize the vast volumes of mathematics that I yet know nothing about (and probably never will). It's very hard to quantify progress - in particular, there are too few tangible returns after too many hours worked. I find myself thinking along the lines of ""Oh, if only someone actually smart were thinking about this problem they would have solved it in moments"" and so on. </p>

<p>I've talked about this to some number of people; here is some advice I have received:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take a day off. Putting in hours upon hours of trying things doesn't magically lead to a solution, particularly if the brain is tired and just wants to sleep.</li>
<li>Have a hobby. Since math research doesn't exactly provide instant gratification, a hobby might provide some instead. </li>
<li>Talk to other graduate students. Realize that many graduate students go through this.</li>

What are good tips/ways to improve my writing on chalkboards?,"<p>Recently, I have started to regularly write on chalkboards. I have also found out that I am quite terrible at it, although my handwriting is quite good.</p>

",139877,11-11-2019 20:19,Techniques for good board handwriting,"<p>I'm a math TA and I find that my most consistent comment for improvement involved my board handwriting. Anybody have some tips or techniques I can use to make things a little neater on the board?</p>

<p>There are, of course, time constraints with teaching any course, so I don't want to simply write more slowly in order to assist in writing more neatly. Thankfully in a math course much of what I write is symbols which are easier to (borrowing a typography term) kern than sentences, but I still feel like I need to vastly improve my handwriting on a board if I plan on teaching for any length of time.</p>

<p>This is a sample of my handwriting:

Like I commented below somewhere, I'm sure 90% of the answers mentioned (those not expressly about chalk, anyway) will be completely cross-transferable and I'll try to make them all work. Thanks again for all the great answers!</p>

",97530,18-10-2017 10:03,Are there instances where citing Wikipedia is allowed?,"<p>For example, suppose you're writing an article about triangles, and you want to include a short proof of Pythagoras' theorem, but you can't quite remember how to derive it, so you pop over to: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem#Algebraic_proofs"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem#Algebraic_proofs</a> and check the proof there. It works mathematically, makes sense and is as far as you can tell, correct, so you include it. Now the proof on Wikipedia doesn't have a citation because probably someone has been taught it and copied it over to Wikipedia, but it's still correct. The only thing you could cite for the proof would be Wikipedia, would a citation be ok or should it just be copied down without a citation?</p>

<p>Edit: Ok, there have been many responses. Most with a firm ""no"", but some giving the reason: ""Just get the proof from a book"" since it's so common, but suppose then it wasn't a common proof of something. Maybe it's not very well known or something but suppose there is a small Wikipedia page with the correct mathematical proof. How much effort are people going to go to to find a proof in a book when there's a (correct (which we know, becuase it's maths and we can check it)) proof on Wikipedia? Why is it so bad to say: ""I found this proof on Wikipedia, and the maths checks out so it doesn't matter who wrote it, it is correct, but that's where I found it."" Or if you do find it somewhere else why not say: ""Proof taken from Wikipedia and verified by the proof shown in ""Triangles and their properties, Nature, 2014, p113 etc...""</p>

"How to submit an article (for example, on arXiv) without being affiliated to any institution?","<p>The core of the problem is already in the title but I feel as i should add some more details.</p>

<p>I was doing some mathematics and, if there are no logical flaws or mistakes of any other nature (it seems that there are none) I managed to prove some result that, again, if it is proved with no errors, would, I believe, enrich the field in which it belongs.</p>

<p>Of course, I immediately started to think about arXiv.org and I decided that I want to submit an article there, but, when I was reading <em>help</em> section, there stands this, written:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Note: It is a violation of our policies to misrepresent your identity or institutional affiliation. Claimed affiliation should be current in the conventional sense: e.g., physical presence, funding, e-mail address, mention on institutional web pages, etc. Misrepresentation of identity or affiliation, for any reason, is possible grounds for immediate and permanent suspension.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But, as you are aware by now, I do not belong to any institution and as such, am not affiliated with any, I am just an amateur that among all fields thinks about mathematics the most. So, I have stumbled upon this cautious note quoted above and do not know what to do.</p>

<p>So, I decided to write to all of you here to see what can be done in this case of mine. I am not 100% sure that among all sites this is the one most suited for this problem of mine (for example, I could have written this on MO Meta or MSE Meta) but surely I will try to welcome opinions and help, even if they do not resolve this issue that I am faced with.</p>

<p>It seems as if I'll be taking the next year off and studying a lot of mathematics on my own and apply to graduate schools in the next cycle. There's a lot of advice both on this website and Academia StackExchange for such students. However, I'd like to know how can students who have studied material outside of class better convince the admissions committee of the work they have done thus far. I know it's generally difficult to do this as an international student; the situation must be different for U.S citizens, I suppose.</p>

<p>Assuming I don't get to take courses which I'll be self studying over the next few months, how should I go about making sure the admissions committee take due notice of the work I have done, and more importantly, they can recognize it, if not verify it completely. Of course, I will keep in touch with my math adviser. In addition, what else can I do? Say, I am studying abstract algebra on my own in the summer, working out problems in, say, Dummit and Foote's book. Should I, perhaps, make a website (a Google site), periodically type the solutions to the work I have done and post it online, so when I apply to graduate schools, I can refer admissions committees to this portfolio of sorts.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, I'd like to know, especially for students who have gone through such a process/situation, of the list of best possible set of actions one can do to make sure the work one has done outside of class is duly considered, if someone who is interested in mathematics schools doesn't have a large number of math courses.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>I have an additional query: I'll be taking next year off, but I'll be able to visit my college. Even though I won't be enrolled in classes, preferably with the instructor(s) who already know me, sit in their classes, work on problem, and perhaps even take exams. even though I won't get a grade, I could ask the instructor to mention in the letter that I completed this task. She could also comment on how well I did relative to my peers. Thoughts? </p>

Is it unethical to hire a paper writer AFTER the assignment is done?,"<p>This is an intriguing scenario that came to my mind. I have not done this and am not planning on doing it, but I am curious about it. Of course, it’s well known that if you hire a paper writer to write your assignment for you, that’s cheating. But what about <em>this</em> situation?:</p>

<p>You have a difficult writing assignment. You follow all the rules, do it yourself, turn it in, and then you get your grade, and it’s a poor grade. But you want to learn what a really good paper for that assignment would look like, for the purposes of gaining knowledge, not grades. So you hire one of those paper writers people usually use to cheat, who is known for getting (dishonest, of course) As on all the papers they write, to nix it for you, so you’ll have an example of what an excellent paper would look like for your study pleasure.</p>

<p>So my question is: is this unethical, and if so, why, and what might be the consequences were it found out? The reason it seems interesting is because it’s being done <em>after</em> the assignment is turned in, so you’re not doing anything to deceive/defraud the teacher or get grades you did not merit – all transactions with the teacher were done by the book. But on the other hand you are going through the motions you’d go through to cheat, not to mention paying money to someone people pay to cheat. So where does this situation stand, ethically, and why?</p>

<p>Obviously both are important, but when it comes down to it, which should weigh more heavily?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Professor Alpha is a premiere name in the field, but he's set up at Southern State University, an otherwise middling school. Perhaps he's there because he's a big fish in a small pond and gets carte blanche and limitless resources to do what he wants. His graduate students are thus treated similarly.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Professor Beta is a new, unproven professor at Top University, a world-renowned, leading institution. He personally may not have the resources and freedom as Professor Alpha, but he's at an institution whose name carries weight. Therefore the school certainly has the capacity for the same, if not more, resources, but access for Professor Beta's grad students will be more limited as they must be shared with other professors' groups.</p>

<p>Assuming all else is equally appealing (funding, location, research topics, etc), which offer do you choose, or which program would you hold in higher regard?</p>

When is it acceptable to report classmates who cheat on an exam?,"<p>So for one of my computer science classes, we have a WhatsApp chat among all students in the class to network and help each other out with questions regarding homework, or if we have any confusion on assignments. It's a given that we can get help on these types of assignments. </p>

<p>But exams are proctored online, and getting help on them is strictly forbidden. However, some students in the chat have posted to the WhatsApp chat during their proctored exams, posting photos of the exams, the questions, and receiving help from others during their exams.</p>

<p>Why would I care about this? So normally, when a student cheats on an exam, it would have no effect on another student because the two overall students' grades are unrelated. However, the exams are curved. So these students that cheated on the exams **not only have an unfair advantage, ** but they also put other students at a disadvantage. Them doing exceptionally better than they would have has the potentiality to reduce other students grades by up to 10-15% of what it would be. So if Student A would normally get a 65 because they don't know the content, they now get a 89, thus, throwing off the entire curve. However, student B who actually DID try his hardest and studied got an 74. Their grade would have been higher with the curve, but student A cheating disrupted the curve. As a result, student B gets an 79, where they would've had an 84 without the several cheaters with almost perfect exam scores at the top.</p>

<p>Personally, I hate to be 'that girl' that reports someone else like a snitch... But I worked so hard in this class. I studied for 6 hours every day before this exam, and got an 83... and these people admit in chat that they would probably fail if they didn't use WhatsApp (have it screenshotted-saying that exactly). So I worked so hard and got an 83. They cheated and got a solid 90, doing no studying, no hard work on their own part. They work full time, so they complain they don't have time. But how is that my fault, or the fault of the other students that the cheater makes different life choices, or chooses to put less time into school, and we as a result should suffer? That's my rationale for wanting to report them. I play fair, so why should we suffer because they don't? </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Many writers are torn between whether <strong><em>they should write the paper
  in the active or passive voice</em></strong>. In the former, the subject performs
  the action; in the latter, the subject receives the action. <strong><em>Too
  much use of the active voice has the tendency to make the text
  monotonous because of too many first-person references. On the other
  hand, overuse of the passive voice can cause the tone of the paper to
  be dry, boring and even pompous</em>.</strong> To ensure that <em>the text is more
  lively and readable,</em> it is best to try and strike a balance. Consider
  the following example:</p>
  
  <p><em>We used eosin-methylene blue agar plates for the preliminary isolation
  of P. aeruginosa. The bacteria were Gram-negative bacilli, and motile.
  The results for oxidase and catalase activities were negative.
  Additional experiments showed that the bacteria did not ferment
  glucose, galactose, maltose or lactose (Table 2). Based on these
  results, we concluded that the organism had an oxidative metabolism.</em></p>
  
  <p>Try translating this in to an entirely passive or active tone.
  <strong>You’ll notice that the creative mix of both voices makes this narrative not only lively and engaging but also states the results in
  a clear, confident and unambiguous manner</strong>.""</p>

Is it possible to get a PhD position in the USA without applying to a PhD program?,"<p>I came across this <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/97152/poor-academic-performance-should-can-i-apply-to-a-phd-program"">question</a>, where an industrial scientist wonders whether they'd have a chance to get into a PhD program in the US. </p>

<p>In my experience (Europe, biochemistry), they'd have a very large chance to get a position. You've already shown you can work, are productive, scientifically literate, and you might even bring some interesting industrial contacts. If you make a good impression someone might even create a job opening for you. </p>

<p>I understand that in the US you don't apply for a position with one professor, but you apply for a PhD program at an institute. You send a statement, recommendation letters, transcripts and GRE and hope for the best.</p>

<p>If I would be a professor in the US, what would be my options to hire such a person if they contact me? Would I have to convince a committee to let them in or do you usually have no influence? Could I just give them a position if I have funds available? I'm interested in the unofficial process in the US.</p>

<p>For a European perspective: </p>

<p>In my field, many positions are filled by hiring people that applied to a research group, even when there's no advertised or available PhD position. If there's funding available, professors check who applied in the previous months, and maybe put out a message to relevant research groups to get more candidates. People are almost always hired directly after completing their Master's, and they did one or two projects on a closely related topic. </p>

How do I explain my poor grade to a grad school committee?,"<p>I'm an Indian student in my 2nd year and I have a subpar(6/10) grade, but that's just because of the school I'm in currently. </p>

<p>I've been a straight A student before university all my life. I'm pretty sure that it's  this school which is super competitive and likes giving extra-hard tests and strict grading which leads me to have a poorer grade, despite knowing/understanding the material. And I'm not the only student who's been disadvantaged here in this manner.</p>

<p>I've interacted with several other schools/students here, or outside India, for example  and I'm pretty sure I'd have a higher grade if I were at one of those schools.</p>

<p>I understand that being challenged is beneficial and the post might just come across as one from a poor student who likes to whine, but my thoughts are genuine. Other factors that contributed to a poor grade are my ADHD and the utter lack of course flexibility.</p>

<p>For clarification, I'm a CS student and I'm talking admissions committees outside of my country(admission to an engineering masters program here takes place differently through tests) - perhaps in the USA/Canada. Are these valid reasons I could get through to them? How?</p>

Accepting a tenure track position if I know I won’t stay till tenure,"<p>I am currently a fixed-term faculty, with the hopes of a tenure-track position somewhere.

After that he show the card hand asked me to explain about it. I told him that I didn't see it and that it is not mine but he kept on saying that it would be impossible for me to not see it. I called for my classmate, who is the owner of the card, and she was asked if it was hers. She said that I must've fallen of her bag.

How is the protest against Elsevier coming along?,"<p>I reread Tim Gowers protest against Elsevier as well as other writings from well-known professors that indicate they still protest.  </p>

<p>I'm also aware of the boycott.</p>

<p>Has this protest actually changed Elsevier's business practices?</p>
",141788,18-12-2019 21:38,Status of Elsevier Boycott,"<p>Starting around 2012, Timothy Gowers had <a href=""https://gowers.wordpress.com/category/elsevier/"">much to say</a> about the practices of Elsevier. Very roughly speaking, he argued that Elsevier made research articles expensive to access and profited heavily from the volunteer work of peer reviewers. Sympathetic individuals established a website called ""<a href=""http://thecostofknowledge.com/"">The Cost of Knowledge</a>"", which hosts the electronic signatures of over 15,000 academics who have agreed to boycott Elsevier to some degree.</p>

<p>Things are relatively quiet now compared to the flurry of activity that followed Gowers' series of posts. The most recent information I can find is <a href=""https://gowers.wordpress.com/2013/05/27/elsevier-journals-has-anything-changed/"">Greg Martin's letter of resignation</a> from the editorial board of Elsevier's ""Journal of Number Theory"", which was posted to Gowers' blog in May of 2013. In it, Martin writes (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As far as I can tell, Elsevier’s responses to our concerns ended up being limited to a <strong>slight easing off of support for legislation limiting access to our research</strong>, together with a <strong>nominal reduction in individual journal prices</strong>. Regarding the latter, however, Elsevier’s <strong>“bundling” practice remains in place</strong>, making individual journals’ prices essentially irrelevant. Their (aggressively defended) <strong>lack of pricing transparency</strong> from one institution to another also speaks volumes, in my mind, to the limits of their desire to seriously address our pricing concerns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My feeling is that not much has changed in the past two years, particularly since I would expect to hear an update from Gowers if any major victories had been won. </p>

Is providing funding enough reason to be a corresponding author?,"<p>There are quite a few questions regarding corresponding authorship on this community, but I was curious about a case where professors (P.I.'s) get their names as the corresponding author because they provide funding and the facilities for research.</p>

<p>Just for some background, I'm still relatively new in the lab I'm at. I'm currently studying computer science in a Korean university. I can't speak for all countries and labs, but I've noticed that at least for my lab our professor's name is listed as the corresponding author as all publications that are submitted by lab members.</p>

<p>This seemed strange to me, because my impression of authorship was that there needed to be some sort of contribution to the work, however minor that may be. Sometimes when students would take their work to their advisor for ""permission"" to submit, he wasn't even aware that this research was taking place.</p>

<p>I've talked to many students around me, and they say that this is reasonble because your advisor is ""paying you and providing the facilities, so technically any work you do under him is also partly owned by him."" I refuted by saying that we're getting paid by the school, and so including our institution's name was enough, and if him ""providing funding"" is a big factor then I would include his name in the ""Acknowledgments"" section but not as an author.. They just told me they strongly advise against excluding my professor's name from the list of authors.</p>

<p>I'm not going to ask ""What should I do?"" because, frankly, there's not really anything I can do but to go along with the rules for now. I'm curious though, is this common practice? Is my initial thinking of what authorship means correct, or does it work a bit differently in the academic setting? Thanks.</p>

A reviewer has stolen my idea – what can I do?,"<p>I submitted a manuscript for publication in May (it was about DFT analysis of a specific system). The manuscript was rejected in October; one reviewer had made some suggestions, and the other recommended rejection as there is nothing new in the paper. I revised the manuscript according to the first reviewer’s suggestion and submitted the manuscript to another journal.</p>

<p>The second journal rejected my manuscript as one reviewer stated that similar analysis has already been published. I checked the reference introduced by the reviewer, and it is exactly the idea of my work with a slightly different method and different discussions. The manuscript had been submitted for publication in July (two months after my first submission). It is hard to assume it is just a coincidence.</p>

<p>I wrote to the editor of the first journal and asked him if the reviewer who rejected my manuscript is one of the authors of this new paper. He replied that he cannot disclose the name of reviewers under any circumstance due to data-protection laws.</p>

<p>Now my research is useless as I cannot publish it anymore. What can I do?</p>
",100071,06-12-2017 19:57,What to do if a referee plagiarises the result after rejecting a paper?,"<p>I find myself in an awkward situation. Nearly two years ago I submitted a paper to a reputable mathematics journal. After 15 months it was rejected with the rationale that there had been papers published (most since the submission date) that contained results that I should have referenced. I found that a little spurious, but moved on and put my work together with some colleagues and got our new paper accepted (pending some language issues) by a different journal.</p>

<p>However, one of my co-authors has found that my exact result (barring some small notational changes, but with the exact same language; I can recognise it as mine, I slaved over finding just the right words!) from my original paper has had the proof published in a book by one author of the references that caused the paper to get originally rejected!</p>

<p>My assumption is thus that the paper was sent to this person to referee and they liked the result so much that they kept it for themselves, which also explains the delay in refereeing... I believe that this author has also presented this result at a conference as their own work. They have a number of papers published on the topic in question from their doctoral thesis.</p>

<p>My question is what steps can I take now to re-assert my authorship?</p>

<p>I believe that it would have been simpler if I had also submitted it to the arXiv, but I wasn't sure (at that time) how that would be seen by the journal. I did give a presentation of my results at a local conference, so I would be able to produce credible witnesses to back up my claim, if necessary. The book published containing my work is largely the doctoral thesis of the author, so I am attempting to find a copy of the thesis since it was deposited before I submitted my paper to the journal. Can anyone suggest any other recourse?</p>

<p>My co-authors would prefer to err on the side of caution and include a reference to the result in our revised paper, but I would really like to reclaim my work...</p>

",100440,13-12-2017 14:13,How long before PhD graduation should I start applying for post-doc positions?,"<p>My earliest PhD graduation date is 10 months away. Funding permits me to stay 1–3 months longer, so the final date is still uncertain.</p>

<p>It is never too early to make contacts for possible post-docs. But how long in advance is too early to formally apply to post-doc job openings or funding opportunities? Depending on the bureaucracy, the path from applying to starting can probably be anything from a week up to a year — someone I know is applying with <a href=""http://www.esa.int/"">ESA</a> which had the opening advertised in August, application deadline in October, will have interviews in December/January, and the commencement of work only in September, 13 months after the initial job advertisement. My personal guess is that the long time between interviews and starting is to create a level playing field between those who do and those who don't need to go through a visa application procedure.</p>

<p>If I'm too early in applying for a post-doc, a hosting institution might prefer someone who can start earlier and where the graduation date is more certain. For example, in my case the graduation date is still uncertain, so there is a risk in accepting even if they are willing to wait. Project funding might also require the money to be spent rather soon.</p>

<p>If I wait too long, there might be a considerable period where I'm between jobs. Having a long (>6 months) period between jobs is a disadvantage for me. Maybe it's also a disadvantage for a hosting institution (I'm not sure).</p>

<p>How do I find the balance? For example, considering the duration of funding and visa applications, does it make sense to apply e.g. <a href=""http://www.vsp.ucar.edu/cgc/2013/2013_Program.html"">8 months in advance</a>? Or is it in any case virtually inevitable to have at least several months before my PhD graduation and the start of a post-doc?</p>

"Succes in research, awful in solving in basic things","<p>I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in pure mathematics. I am studying abroad. I need some advice.
Before getting through to my question, let me say something about myself. I am studying at a good university in Europe. I have 3 papers, which two of them are my own papers(without co-authors). I am planning to defend my thesis in the following summer. Moreover, I am applying for a postdoc position.</p>

<p>My Ph.D. story is a sad story. After two years, my Ph.D. supervisor informed the university that I do not know any things about math, and he could not work with me. Then, the university chose a co-supervisor for me. After 1year, I and my co-supervisor wrote a paper. To be honest, my co-supervisor had a lot of nice ideas and I wrote his idea in papers. I did not fill good because that was most of his idea, but my colleges told me we always did the same things. There was a lot of pressure on me because all of the people found out my problems with my supervisor and they thought I am weak and stupid. </p>

<p>Last summer, I wrote two papers in the area which I have been working since my Ph.D. Then, everything changed. My supervisor said hello to me every day( before he did not say) and behavior everyone changes to me. I got some emails from great mathematicians about my papers. </p>

<p>I have two big problems. First, I can not solve basic things in math. That makes me feel upset and worried. For instance, when I got up today, I was thinking the following statements are equal: For all x, there is y such that x+y=4&amp; There is x, for all y such that x+y=4, but somethings in my heart was saying I am wrong. So I start to read a logic book. That is not shaming for a Ph.D. student? Is it? or, Why I do not remember Linear Algebra? and other whys?</p>

<p>These kinds of questions make me feel I got lucky to write two papers. Anyone get lucky. My supervisor might be right, I do not know any things from math. How I can pass PhD exam?</p>

How much will a bad grade in a relevant Master's class hurt my chances for a statistics PhD?,"<p>I'm currently doing a master's in statistics, and I'd like to do a PhD in statistics and focus on machine learning.</p>

<p>However, I am almost certain that I will receive a C+ in my (calculus-based) probability theory class. A C+ would be an outlier for me; I never got lower than an A- in undergrad and an A in grad school (this includes real analysis classes). If it makes any difference, I will have a published article in machine learning by the time I apply to statistics PhD programs.</p>

<p>Also, I don't think this is a duplicate question. I didn't have a serious medical emergency this semester, but I felt ill during the final and a poor grade there would sink my grade. Also, other questions ask about non-relevant classes, but I think that this grade is relevant.</p>

How should I handle a paper with incorrect experimental results?,"<p>We found that a paper, published in an important CS conference, presents incorrect results in its experimental evaluation section.</p>

<p>Merely reading the paper is not sufficient to spot these mistakes, as the source of incorrectness lies within the the experimental evaluation and none of the algorithms/pseudo-code presented in the paper seems to be affected by it. That somehow explains how the error made it past the peer-review barrier.</p>

<p>We are currently in the process of circumscribing to what extent the results are incorrect. This is made difficult by the fact that the authors did not provide sufficient information to fully reproduce/verify their original experiment (not even upon gentle request), so we can only verify a limited portion of it (although it is substantial enough to draw our conclusions).</p>

<p>We tend to believe that the authors made a mistake in good faith and that they failed to spot it because they did not double-check the correctness of the results they obtained. We also don't have any reason to believe that the unreproducible portion of their results is incorrect as well.</p>

<p>We want to stress the fact that this problem only affects a subset of their results. The mistake they did somehow invalidates some of the conclusions of the experimental evaluation, although it does not seem to affect it as a whole nor to hinder the perceived worthiness of the algorithms presented in the paper.</p>

<p>We would like to ask what would be the best approach for disclosing this <em>'finding'</em>. </p>

",101165,26-12-2017 15:26,Can I challenge a paper already published in a peer reviewed conference/journal?,"<p>I recently came across several papers in the area of Information Extraction and Data Mining which seem to have passed the review process even if they (1) use some new terminology without describing it, (2) replicate some old and popular technique and just describe it in a new way, (3) use new datasets without releasing them publicly or describing them in detail, (4) confusing language that doesn't seem to describe the methods... and much more. </p>

<p>Why challenge them? Such papers give these people a kind of leverage in situations where number of publications count rather than quality of genuine work. They also encourage, let's say, 'pseudoscience' within the scientific community - or fraud, as those more experienced among you say.</p>

<p>I've faced situations like:-</p>

<ul>
<li>Someone hired me from a freelance site to implement a previously published paper. The paper doesn't adequately describe the novel methods they claim. I spend a week on it but don't get paid. </li>
<li>Similar situation but the implementation's accuracy doesn't match the claim.</li>
<li>In a semi-academic gathering (tea time in a summer school), a discussion turned into a debate. Though I wasn't involved in it, one of the others said something which I pointed out as being logically wrong. It turned personal and one of them claimed that they knew better because of having twice the number of papers than me. Later when I read their papers I found that they didn't contain any ideas that would count as a genuine research. </li>
</ul>

<p>I guess some of you might have been in similar situations before. Yes it doesn't matter in the longer term; but it is hard to avoid some situations like this and I think it might be hampering the research community as a whole. </p>

<p>Here are the exact points of my question:</p>

<ol>
<li>Should we confront such publications? Would we get anything out of it? </li>
<li>Is it even feasible?  </li>
<li>How can I do so? What actions are possible in such cases? What is the best course of action?</li>
</ol>

<p><em>p.s. Yes citations matter more than just throwing papers - but such publications also get citations from other equally content-less papers published in similar conferences.</em> </p>

I need three recommendation letters with two of them being academic reference letters. Honestly, last year, I had requested two recommendation letters from two of my former professors for my law school applications. However, in the end, I decided not to pursue law school for a number of reasons, despite being accepted to one. Currently, I am applying to a number of different schools' masters' programs in the field I plan to study. </p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, I am having difficulty with the recommendation letter process. I wrote emails to those two professors about my situation, and one professor was willing to revise her former recommendation letter for my new masters' programs applications. However, I have yet to hear back from the other professor. I had written a senior thesis under that professor, and I was hoping to receive a letter from him. After I sent an email to that professor a few weeks ago, and received no response, I sent him a follow-up email yesterday. I received no response to that follow-up email either. If there is no response, does that mean a discreet ""no""? Should I send another follow-up email a few days later? Or, should I find another academic recommender at this point? My first application deadline is in the middle of December. </p>

The second one still hasn’t. It is due in 3 weeks. I emailed him last Friday asking him again if he would be willing to be a reference but still no response. I don’t have his phone number and he doesn’t work at the university. I really don’t want to annoy him, but should I email him again? I do have his gmail address (I’ve been emailing him from his work one). Usually he contacts me from his work one but I have received ones from his gmail account in the past. But I am afraid this would be frowned upon and looked on as being too invasive? I am really at a loss. I do have another reference, however, she is more a professional reference and I am not sure if that is allowed (the school isn’t getting back to me on this question). </p>

What to do with a likely collaborator who is not answering mails?,"<p>A few months ago, I contacted a person who conducted research in a topic that could easily be combined with my own work.

He answered me and showing interest in the work (that is what I read between lines). Furthermore, he recommended me some literature.</p>

<p>When I read about half of the documentation, I sent him a mail with the insights I got and several of my publications, justifying my points.
He answered me again, discussing some points and glad to have my work pending to read.</p>

",102413,18-01-2018 11:12,Dealing with irresponsiveness from far-away scientists,"<p>When meeting some scientists in person, I've had good conversations with decisions upon interesting plans for research cooperation and personal visits. But then, subsequent contact by e-mail is difficult, where the other party either doesn't reply at all, or very slowly (several weeks +). However, when I then meet them again at a later date, they are still enthusiastic about the project (where the bulk of the work is mine) and a short in-person discussion makes more progress than the past months of (lack of) e-mail have. So it appears that a lack of interest in the project does not explain the lack of response. The project is scientifically interesting, fits with my PhD, and the visit enhances my chances of finding a post-doc after my PhD (it's a very good institute for my field).</p>

<p>I understand that many scientists are very busy and flooded by e-mail, but it feels sad to abandon a potentially interesting project just because communication by e-mail is not working well. I'm quite sure it would work if I were in the same building. What strategies exist to mitigate this problem? I can think of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Try to ask a common acquaintance to poke him/her (my local colleague has a shared friend with him/her). Pro: Might get indirect feedback as to why the irresponsiveness. Con: involves 3rd party (may or may not be on-site) not necessarily involved.</li>
<li>Send reminder e-mails (<em>did you see my e-mail from 20 February?</em>). Pro: increases chances of being noticed. Con: may be considered annoying</li>
<li>Phone. Pro: hard to run away. Con: I don't like phoning and I don't like being phoned.</li>
<li>E-mail someone sitting in the neighbouring office. Pro: neighbour has small step to irresponsive scientist. Con: a bit strange to involve someone I don't even know</li>
<li>Give up on the project. Con: means no project and no visit.</li>
<li>Try to do the project without their input. Pro: no need for communication. Con: might waste a lot of time by trying known dead-ends that I'm not aware of. </li>

Is it possible to cite from an abstract in a scientific paper,"<p>I was wondering whether it is possible to cite information from the abstract part of another scientific paper.</p>

<p>Let's say that you read something interesting in the abstract of a scientific paper and that you want to cite that information.</p>

<p>Is it normal to use that specific research paper as a reference source?</p>

<p>The question arises because normally the abstracts of scientific papers don't contain references, but still the abstract would reflect what the authors of that paper conclude/claim.</p>

<p><strong><em>EDIT</em></strong></p>

<p>To further ellaborate:</p>

<p>My question is relating to scientific papers in general.</p>

<p>I know that the abstract normally does not contain any citations like: [1].</p>

<p>The abstract is like a summary of the scientific paper.</p>

<p>When I quote or cite from the abstract of a certain scientific paper, I would be citing as if that scientific paper is the source.</p>

<p>As a result if assuming that the abstract of a scientific paper contains the conclusions of authors that wrote the abstract. Even though these authors partly or not partly based those conclusions on external sources.
So my question is whether that specific abstract/conclusion would be a valid source to cite from, making the scientific paper containing the abstract the source of citation.</p>

Normally this is not a full lesson but a 15-minute version which is performed in absence of actual students for just a few professors from a hiring committee.

Is it ethical for an instructor to use their own textbook in an undergraduate course?,"<p>Students in an undergraduate course often have no choice of a textbook for the subject and are expected to buy the book recommended by the instructor. The expectations can be advisory or mandatory. Given the degree of control that an instructor has over their undergraduate students, especially freshmen and sophomores, is it ethical to use a textbook authored by the instructor in an undergraduate course? Does such requirement not constitute a conflict of interest?</p>

<p>P.S. I understand that practically this is done times and again, but I would like to sense the general feelings.</p>
",102502,19-01-2018 23:17,Is it ethical to profit by having my students buy my textbook?,"<p>This question was suggested to me by <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/15064/how-can-i-sell-my-text-book-to-my-students-in-e-book-format"">How can I sell my text book to my students in e-book format?</a> which asked about the practicalities, but attracted many comments about the ethics.  So this question is to ask about the ethics directly.</p>

<p>Suppose I have written and published a textbook, and I want to use it as the text for a course I am teaching.  I receive royalties from each copy of my book that is sold, so if my students are required to buy my textbook for the course, I will make some money.  <strong>Is it ethical to do so?</strong></p>

<p>Well-reasoned opinions would be useful answers, but even more useful would be pointers to institutional policies, professional codes of ethics, etc, that address this issue.</p>

<p>Of course, there are many ways to avoid profiting from the sale of my book to my students.  If my contract with my publisher allows it, I could distribute PDFs to my students, or have the university bookstore print out copies and sell them at cost.  Another approach I've heard of is to compute how much I earn in royalties on each copy, and refund that amount from my pocket to each student who buys a copy.  Or, use my royalty earnings to buy pizza for the class.  Certainly these are nice gestures, but I would like opinions on whether they are ethically required.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: To address some questions that have arisen in the comments:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This question is hypothetical.  I haven't published any textbooks myself and have no immediate plans to do so.  In any case, my personal preference would be to make the book available to students for free, if at all possible.  So I've phrased this question in the first person for rhetorical convenience only.</p></li>
<li><p>I had intended the question to be only about the potential financial conflict of interest that could arise if I make money by assigning my own book.  Some of the answers feel that it is improper for me to assign my own textbook at all, whether I make money or not, but I don't think this point of view is prevalent within the academic community.  If it happens that my book (as a pithy but now-deleted comment put it) ""blows"", I think most would agree that my decision to assign it is pedagogically unfortunate, but not unethical.  </p></li>
<li><p>I don't literally mean that students would be <em>required to buy</em> the book, only that they'd be expected to have it.  I might assign readings or homework problems from the book, so that the student needs access to the book in order to do them, but they could certainly achieve this by getting a used copy or borrowing from a friend.  But probably most students would buy new copies anyway, since that is the most convenient way.</p></li>

I have worked in various jobs as a research assistant (physics, biology, economics) usually involving programming, mathematics or statistics.  As a newly minted undergraduate, I didn't really have much confidence in myself and I completely ruled out graduate school as pointless.  I didn't think of myself as smart enough.  I drifted into working in labs, because those are some of the easiest ones for which one can get a work permit in the US as a non-American.</p>

<p>Having worked in academia for a while now, I've had a chance to leap into various fields and help build solutions to complex problems.  I think I have literally gone as far as I can go researching in academia with no higher degree.  I work at one of the top universities in the world.  (If you looked at US News rankings or the Academic Ranking of World Universities, it's in the top 5.)</p>

<p>Lately, I've been thinking about applying for graduate school.  I do have a few papers in various fields.  I'm thinking of a PhD in either pure mathematics, applied mathematics, statistics or computer science. </p>

<p>I see two big minuses to applying to graduate school:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Most people applying are more than a decade younger than I am.  (Alas, more than a few gray hairs have made an appearance in recent years.)</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps my achievements would look good for someone younger, but partially my achievements are the result of a long career rather than any special brilliance. So, I wonder how my record will be perceived.  I did take GRE and I scored 800 quantitative, 800 verbal and a 5 on the essay.  (I would most likely have to do a GRE subject test depending on what field I ultimately decided.)</p></li>

<p>I understand that peer reviewing probably started when there were relatively fewer article submissions than today and when the academic system was going at a slower pace and was less cluttered with people. </p>

<p>But given how the system has evolved, I am wondering <strong>why do employers let their employee work for free for the monetary benefit of a third party?</strong> 
As far I as know no employer pays its employees to make someone else rich. It seems against any economics principle. <strong>Wouldn't it be more efficient to pay reviewers so they would be more motivated, quicker to review, and universities/grants/governments would not pay someone to work for free for the economic benefit of someone else?</strong> This might also offset the cost of salary of professors.

I have good grades, with CGPA above 9(/10)(However, all courses in my university are graded on a curve so the actual marks are significantly lower than 90%). This has been my marks throughout my undergraduate and graduate courses and I was happy because this was above average. Also, my summer projects in UG were usually computational and any difficulty I had in theoretical aspects I attributed it to my inexperience in advanced Physics. </p>

<p>However, recently I have started to work on pure theoretical project and while reading for the project I realized that I consistently miss some details from each topic. I understand the general idea, can re-derive most of the equations(with some effort) however when I discuss things with my professor or when I read further topics I realize that I have missed certain key-details. This is exactly similar to the case of me missing a few key questions in my exams and getting that 9 grade point instead of 10(or at-least I think so). I was not worried about this before but now I realize that there is some flaw in the way I study (but I do not know what). </p>

<p>Any direct suggestion would help or even certain general guidelines on what I can do.  </p>

<p><strong>Things I've tried recently -</strong> </p>

<p>1) I've started to written down almost everything I read. This is slightly laborious but is certainly helping. It also helps me to gloss over the things I read previously when I come back the next day.</p>

<p>2) I completely avoid smartphone when I'm library/study room so that I won't get distracted. Not sure if it helps me solve the above problem but certainly helps me study better in general.</p>

<p>3) I've tried to read the topics from several sources. The books I am reading is somewhat like a collection of research papers and hence does not have a exercises. So I though reading from various sources might help get better ideas but it's not really helping because most other sources are too high level as an introductory text. But this will probably help me in cases where it's practical to do this.</p>

<p>4) Somewhat similar to point (1)- I am trying reread, whenever I can, what I've done until that point. But not sure how much this will help me in filling the gaps.</p>

Publishing with a Pseudonym that uses my legal first name as last name,"<p>I will soon be published at a peer-reviewed journal and this is my first publication in my career. My concern is that I'm Asian descent and have an extremely common last name, and personally I do not wish to be identified with my legal last name at all.</p>

<p>On the other hand, my Asian first name is relatively unique. Also, I've been going by an English nickname since I moved to US, and all the people I know knows me as my nickname since I always introduce myself with it in person and in my resume.</p>

<p>So, I thought I would choose my publishing name that is unique and personal to be</p>

<p>not this:</p>

<p><strong>[legal first name] [legal last name]</strong></p>

<p>but this:</p>

<p><strong>[daily-used nick name] [legal first name].</strong></p>

<p>I thought about adding my nickname as middle name, but this still results in tons of same names due to my last name.</p>

<p>The question is, would this be considered a good idea if I will always use this for publishing from now on? Or would it cause any big troubles in future career, such as employers having a difficulty with identifying my work or other issues? Are there any potential issues with this style of pseudonym?</p>

<p>I read other similar posts about publishing in pseudonym, but the closest I could find to my question was this:</p>

How to overcome seminar boredom,"<p>I find I am frequently uninterested in the weekly seminars in my faculty, which consists of applied mathematics, fluid dynamics, and computer science.  My niche is a small sliver between applied maths and CS.</p>

<p>I know it's valuable to hear talks on things completely unrelated to what you do-- you never know what you'll learn-- but mostly what happens is that I see the first few slides, get bored and/or overwhelmed by too many foreign ideas, and then tune out and work on my own research.  In theory, I know that asking questions helps with engagement, but when a topic is too foreign, I would need to ask questions every slide to properly follow, and that would just be disruptive.  I then wonder why I bother attending at all, but the church-like culture surrounding the weekly seminars (i.e., ""you have to go because someone with more power strongly suggests it"") keep me there.</p>

<p>How can I get more out of these seminars that I'm obligated to attend?  (Note that responses like ""Suck it up"" or ""Get over it, we all go through this"" are not welcome-- I've found that this kind of approach just leads to acrimony.)</p>

"When Does ""Adapting"" An Image Go Too Far?","<p>I am interested in using a particular figure from the literature, but I do not want to go through the hassle of paying to use a figure. What I am wondering is if I made a similar figure, how easy is it to get in trouble for copyright infringement?

As an example, I provided two illustrative examples where the bottom image is an ""adapted"" version: </p>

"(Potentially) Low GPA with No Reserach Experience, Am I Screwed for math PhD program?","<p>I am a Japanese junior student who is thinking of applying to the PhD program(Applied Mathematics/Statistics) in the U.S. for the 2021 cycle, but I think I have an incredibly low chance to be accepted to any programs.</p>

<p>Firstly, my GPA is really bad compared to other applicants. I have seen GPA of applicants on <a href=""https://mathematicsgre.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://mathematicsgre.com/</a> and most of the people in that forum have at least a GPA of 3.8 or even 4.0. However, my overall GPA until the first semester of junior year was 3.48/4.0(Math GPA 3.5), which is really low for grad school. This was because I took too many courses and could not handle some of them(did not fail any but low grades). Moreover, my GPA in the third quarter this year is not going to be good because my grade in a literature class(it was mandatory to take it) is going to be C in S(4)-A(3)-B(2)-C(1) grading and I messed up in quantum mechanics exam. Grades in math classes are not going to be all S too. I am trying to get nice grades in this fourth quarter, but it will not be as good as average applicants.</p>

<p>Secondly, I literally have no research experience. From what I have seen, college students in the U.S. have an opportunity to do REUs. However, it is not the case in Japan. Math majors are not even expected to write a senior thesis and research opportunities are very limited here. I have asked my advisor about this but could not get any good results.</p>

<p>I still have not taken GRE, but from what I have heard, the GRE score does not matter as long as it is not astronomically bad, which does not help in my case.</p>

<p>*In the course I'm currently teaching, the recitations are planned and written by the ones giving them (without the professors' supervision). Also, the people giving the recitations are not necessarily grad students (some already hold a PhD).

",120925,02-12-2018 09:43,Distance learning: taken seriously?,"<p>I'm currently in the first year of a six year bachelor's degree aiming for astrophysics. The course is a home/distance learning setup run by the Open University. While I am enjoying it thoroughly, I am aware of the academic politics that can dog professional science. So my question is thus: Upon soldiering on with the degree, then masters, and then PhD, will I be taken seriously within a professional setting given my inability to reference a leading university for my education? Will the format for my studying be ""pitied""? </p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> I suppose a bit more info may help. I'm 27,wife, 2 children, and I currently work as a full time chef, and self employed part time IT technician. I flunked my GCSEs, with no further education. The past 3 years have been a revelation for me, and I have discovered a before unexperienced love for academia; specifically, physics and astronomy. Last year I completed a 1 year OU maths brush up course, which at the time I really struggled with. This year I had a bout of madness and took the plunge for a BSc degree in astronomy. I am now loving the math within the physics so far (yet to hit calculus though!)</p>

<p>PhD, and even masters, is a long way off.  Also, since this original post I've improved my understanding of what a PhD actually entails. So I realise that if I get there, it may well not have anything to do with the OU! </p>

<hr>

<p>It occurs to me that a lot of my initial queries could have been avoided with a better understanding of the educational and qualification system itself. I now have a greater appreciation as to what a PhD actually <em>is</em>, realising that its a long way off and not necessarily needed for a fulfilling career in research.</p>

<p>I think trying to repair my broken education and fight my way into a worthwhile (and productive!) career is enough of challenge at the moment. There will be plenty of time later for worries concerning doctorates.</p>

<p>It is good to hear that there is at least an open mind towards distance educated professionals. </p>

How do commitees evaluate candidates from foreign / unknown universities?,"<p><em>I'm asking out of curiosity / because I think the answer may be of general interest:</em></p>

<p><strong>A bit of context:</strong> When I applied to PhD programs, I had degrees from two institutions. One (let's call it ""A"") is more selective and trains students a little more in depth than the other (which we'll call ""B""), but doesn't really have a great international reputation (being very teaching-focused). </p>

<p>During interviews abroad, it felt like I was considered as a ""serious"" applicant because I studied in the other institution, B, which is much more famous because of its research programs, but actually didn't contribute as much to my training. Clearly, nobody had ever heard of institution A. During one of my interviews, an interviewer even saw my grades from university A, where grading is very strict, and asked me: ""do you think your grades are good enough to go to [our prestigious university]?"". In a live interview, I had the opportunity to explain these grades, but what about the other programs that did not invite me for interviews? I can't help but think that this kind of misunderstanding may have played a bigger role than it should have. </p>

<p>Fortunately I joined the program that I wanted the most. But I started wondering: what if I had only studied in institution A?</p>

<p><strong>So here's the question:</strong> Those of you who, at some point, were part of selection commitees (for college, grad school etc.), how did you evaluate candidates who studied in small, foreign and/or unknown universities/high schools, as opposed to big, local, well-known universities/high schools? </p>

<p>In particular, how did you take into account :</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Different grading standards</em> - in institution A, the equivalent of a 70% was considered an unusually good grade, whereas in some prestigious universities, an A or a B is quite normal; that difference does not always appear on transcripts.</li>
<li><em>Different curriculum structures</em> - some universities may require that students in their first/second years take classes  that do not seem very relevant for certain grad school applications</li>
<li><em>Different opportunities to perform research</em> - this time in university B, a students would only perform research once at the end of their masters, so significant undergrad research experience is unusual and would require a lot of extra commitment</li>
<li><em>Different prestige</em> - the ""best university of the country"" may not be as famous as MIT or Harvard, depending on the country. For example are you familiar with the <em>best</em> university in, say, Kazakhstan (no offense meant, Kazakhstani friends)? Would you ""trust"" a degree more if it came from a more famous institution?</li>
<li><em>Different academic culture</em> - Europeans, for example, do not typically have a long list of ""dean's list"", ""undergaduate award for (XXX)"" etc.; it's simply not a thing there, so even exceptional students just don't have these. Writing SOPs is also not common in certain countries, so students are not trained to ""modestly praise themselves"" and might seem a little clumsy when they try to do so.</li>
<li>Anything else? </li>
</ul>

<p>Have you ever faced this kind of issues when evaluating candidates? Did you at any point take extra steps to make sure this kind of differences would not penalize international applicants?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: this question is not entirely similar to other questions like ""<a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/26791/how-handicapped-am-i-in-graduate-admissions-if-i-graduated-from-a-lower-tier-uni"">How handicapped am I in graduate admissions if I graduated from a lower tier university</a>?"". Indeed, this question focuses on applications within a single country, with <em>a priori</em> homogeneous definitions of what a ""good"" university is, with known grading standards... Answers to this question clearly assume that it is possible to define ""good"" and ""bad"" grades by looking at a transcript, for example. My questions challenges the notion that the application documents (SOP, GPA etc) are meaningful, because unless a commitee member knows the high school / university of origin of an applicant, they really have no way to tell whether grades are good or not, because standards are not uniform. </p>

professor pushing me to get result when nothing is right!,"<h3>Background</h3>

<p>My professor assigned me a project as part of a course. <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/120586/how-to-stop-working-for-other-peoples-thesis"">The project is part of another student's thesis</a> and has several flaws. I explained the problems of the project to my professor. However, the professor seems to believe that I just don't understand the project and don't know how to code.</p>

<p>The professor now sent the other student on a work trip for seven or eight months, starting in 10 days.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the professor asked me to fix the project and produce the results.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the project is so flawed that I can't produce results with it. I believe that it's the other student's responsibility to fix the project. S/he also knows the project and it's issues much better than I do.</p>

<p>The professor still doesn't consider my concerns and just pushes me to finish the project. He wants to grade the course based on a publishable paper from this flawed project. (My other classmates already have required information to design a controller, and assigning this flawed project and grading like this is not fair.) Meanwhile, the professor does not even want to talk about a topic for my own thesis. I feel taken advantage of and don't know what to do.</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<p>Later, I was asked to upload my code for use in a paper. It turned out that the data the grad student had generated was not appropriate, and he needed to do other experiments. It later turned out there were other problems with the underlying model, and I redid a lot of that work as well.</p>

<p>The problem is that this other student is not really contributing at all. </p>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes he does not come to work at all</li>
<li>On one occasion the professor assigned us to do something, and he immediately told me he had no idea how to do it</li>
<li>In one of our meetings with the professor, he talked 2 minutes with the prof with no slides; I talked for the other 58 with slides. </li>

"How important is the grade for a course I took, if I want to pursue graduate studies in that field?","<p>I recently made the decision to pursue graduate studies and apply for an MS in computer science program during next year's application process. More specifically, the field that I want to study is machine learning. However, there is something that's been concerning me a lot for the past few days.</p>

<p>I'm actually taking a machine learning course this semester, and I don't believe I did too well. I think I'll end up with either a C+ or at best a B or - if the professor feels very generous - a B+. If I were to give an excuse for the result, I'm not too familiar with many of the tools we used in class (Python, Sci-kit Learn, etc.) and the professor, TA's, and fellow students all gave me the same answer of ""it's your job to learn on your own"" when I would ask questions (which is true to an extent). It was a disheartening semester, to say the least. But excuses aren't important, and the result is that I didn't perform well.</p>

<p>Now the actual question is: Would this affect my graduate studies application? My GRE scores are satisfactory (163V/169Q/5.5AW) and my TOEFL scores are also good (118/120). Upon graduation I will have around a 3.2-3.4/4.0 GPA.</p>

<p>I've heard stories of professors rejecting applicants because they performed poorly for relevant courses despite showing positive traits in other ways, and I guess that's been concerning me.</p>

How to Make up for Mediocre STEM GPA? Will Postbac Help?,"<p>I am a senior in college majoring in cognitive science and considering grad programs in neuroscience/cognitive science. Long story short, I didn't do super well in a lot of the STEM classes I took. Specifically, I got a B- in intro programming and C+ in intro computer science, C in gen chem (A- in lab though), and C- in orgo. I've gotten B's and B+'s in every math class I took (intensive intro stats and calc up to multivariable).</p>

<p>I've gotten A's in most major classes (related to cog sci), A-'s and B+'s in biology classes. </p>

<p>Overall, my GPA is hovering around a 3.3.</p>

<p>I definitely tried hard in my classes- I think some of the bad grades are due to mental health struggles related to personal and family crises, others due to me turning in problem sets late (i.e. would've gotten A's on most of them but got points off for lateness). So the problem was rarely me struggling with the material. </p>

<p>I don't feel confident in terms of applying to grad school, so I'm seeking advice from anyone who's been in a similar position. Can a good GRE score, research experience, and good rec letters make up for these bad grades? Will I need to do a postbac or something extra to enhance my chances of getting into a neuroscience/cognitive science PhD program?</p>

<p>Also, will the fact that I am at Yale make any difference or not really?</p>

I got a B- in Math. How bad is that for Econ?,"<p>So the title explains why I'm posting. I'm a masters student in economics at a pretty prestigious university and one of the courses that you're required to take as a first year is called Math Methods for Economists. It covers topics from Calculus to Linear Algebra and Differential Equations. I really wanted an A in this class because I'm hoping to have the option of applying to a really good PhD program (although I'm not sure yet), but I got a B- in the class.</p>

<p>I'm pretty upset by this. I really thought I could get an A. I took Calc I and II as an undergrad and I got halfway through Linear Algebra- I dropped out because it was the last semester of my senior year and honestly I was just lazy (but I still remembered a lot of the concepts from the class).</p>

<p>In the class I did really quite poorly on the first exam and I do blame myself for not preparing enough for that one. I was going to drop the class and retake it in the Spring (because you have the option of taking it online with FULL internet access during the exams) but then the professor said that if you get an A on the final he'd just give you an A in the class. I was determined to use that loop hole and get that A on the final.</p>

<p>I spent the 5 days before the exam studying so hard- I mean every free second that I wasn't eating or sleeping- I was up until 3:00am every night studying. I don't think I've ever spent so much time preparing for an exam.</p>

<p>I kind of knew it was hopeless though. This professor gives insanely hard exam questions that he does almost nothing to prepare you for. As aforementioned, I have quite a bit of background in math and I have never seen math problems like the ones he puts on his exams.They're not conceptually hard to understand but he tries to trick you using the most obscure algebra techniques that even software has trouble finding a closed form solution for. I've tried plugging some of the problems into symbolab.com and multiple times I was told ""can not be solved"" - which I didn't even know was possible. </p>

<p>I ended up getting an 82 on the exam and I just think its so unfair that I have to have a B- on my transcript. I've never blamed a professor for my own grade but this is ridiculous. I know some students complained about the professor directly to the program advisor before and nothing resulted from it.</p>

<p>Is there anything I can do about this? Does the B- condemn me to eternal graduate school hell? I'm really just looking for some peace of mind.</p>

Publish a paper without supervisor,"<p>I have done a research project for a vocational masters. During then, there was a major disruption in the teaching department which affected the supervision process. However, I was already having another Masters degree and was in my last stage of a PhD degree program as well. So I planned, conducted, analysed and wrote my research thesis without any supervision. The only supervision I can think of is reading the completed thesis by my supervisor (which was assigned to me in later stage of the project, who  managed to give very minor comments which I feel was not significant at all as I did not have to change things except some paraphrasing and proofreading as I'm not a native English speaker. </p>

<p>Now I'm in the process of publishing a paper from that research and wondering if I can publish it as a single author paper? I normally do not mind to involve my supervisor or any team member who worked with me in a study as long as I believe there was some how a considerable contribution, but in this time, my work is asking me to publish a single author paper as part of the requirement for promotion so there is another reason to push me more critical for whom should be involved. So do you think it is okey based on the above situation to proceed in publishing the work by my own as a single author paper? </p>

<p>What are the requirements for a supervisor to be included as an author on a paper, as opposed to just appearing in the acknowledgements?

On the other hand, I have two co-authored publications in not excellent but very good journals.

Approaching a master's in humanities after STEM-focused undergrad,"<p>I graduated this past year from an Ivy League university with a double major in a STEM field and Asian studies (with a focus in literature). Throughout university I felt the desire to eventually pursue a graduate degree in the humanities, but for various reasons ended up focusing much more on my STEM work. In my final year, I took some courses in religious studies that reignited my long-held interest in that field. Since graduating, I've been constantly reading books and papers on religion while working in tech. I think I'd like to pursue a master's in religious studies, both as a way to see if the field is really right for me and as a way to beef up my admittedly anemic experience in the area for the sake of a potential PhD. </p>

<p>But to be honest, I'm not sure of my prospects of getting into a good master's program. I feel like my lack of background will hurt my chances significantly. Although there is a little bit of overlap with my Asian studies degree (the language skills would help if I wanted to pursue Buddhist studies, for example), I'm not confident there's enough there to demonstrate adequate knowledge and interest. Furthermore, I took more than a few of my humanities classes in undergrad pass/fail since I was being pushed so heavily down the path of STEM. Should I be doing something else before applying to programs? Do I even have a shot of getting into a good program? What's the expectation for applicants coming out of undergrad?

Can a cousin write a recommendation letter for graduate school?,"<p>I have a cousin who used to be a research engineer at MIT until recently, and now is the global manager of a company. While at MIT, he suggested that I should apply for graduate school there (I'm an undergrad in Mechanical Engineering in Brazil). He knows me pretty well and is encouraging me to try. I have a good GPA, 3.6/4 as of now, but could be 3.8/4 by the time I graduate. I also have published papers, some of which will be published in top journals. 
Since he used to be part of the MIT community, would a recommendation letter from him be an advantage for me? Or, because he's family, the comittee could simply consider it biased? </p>

What is the usual dress code for academic workshops?,"<p>I'm attending my first academic/industry workshop next week and was wondering what is the convention with regards to the dress code. It's a three-day affair where each participant is required to present a 3 minute introduction to their PhD. Other than that the event consists mostly of talks by other people.</p>

<p>Normally, I'd go with formal business wear if I were presenting as a named part of the programme. If I was just attending I'd go for 'academia-casual'. That being said, I've never been to a workshop so I probably don't know what I'm talking about, especially with the inclusion of the 3 minute 'introduce yourself' presentation.</p>

How to deal with my fear of large audiences?,"<p>I am having problems facing audiences. During my primary and secondary school period I had inferiority complexes due to my size. Therefore I always skipped and ran from debates, but now I graduated with a good grade from university. I am a teacher now and still have this phobia of facing crowds. No matter how I prepare, whenever I stand in front of the crowd, my voice will be shaking. I really need your advice because I tried every method, but they are not working and it's depressing.</p>
",103600,10-02-2018 16:03,Lecturer with anxiety. How to survive in academia?,"<p>I've been a long time member of academia.SE but I created this alt account because the question is a bit embarrassing. I finished my PhD 4 years ago and after a 2 year postdoc at a different university secured a contractual lecturership. During my PhD I never realised I had fear of public speaking, because I always felt secure presenting in front of my supervisor. Even at conferences, his presence in the audience was enough to keep me relaxed.</p>

<p>Fast forward to my postdoc, I was mostly working and publishing by myself. So, even if I had to present something it was to my coauthors, with which I am okay. But as a lecturer doing research part of my time, I am involved in projects and seminars where I am expected to present my latest work. Being on my own has brought out my inner anxiety, so much so that I choked during a presentation, had to drink water to calm my nerves and apologise for my breathlessness and slurred speech. That was the most embarrasing thing in my life. Please note that the anxiety is not the result of me not publishing or doing research. I have published more than most in my department. Knowing that hasn't helped with the anxiety though. I am constantly making excuses to get out of project presentations and seminar talks. Fortunately, the anxiety is less intense in teaching and I am able to manage. </p>

<p>How do I survive as an academic? Now even conference presentations seem daunting. I can publish exclusively in journals, but how do I get out of giving project and departmental presentations? How can I politely refuse to present without revealing my situation? Or better yet, how do I fix the whole thing? That one bad presentation has really messed me up.</p>

"Citing, Secondary Source","<p>My question is about citing. I found two sectences that were cited in a review article (first sentence[1], extra information about it[2]. Second sentence [3]). And after that i found the original references and read them. (I didn't need ref [2], i just remove it and didn't talk about it)</p>

<p>At the end, i changed the places of them (flipped...1-3 to 3-1). Also i paraphrase them and added some words on them. Because in review article some parts of them were missing. But i gave reference to the original sources not to review article. So, is it considered to be plagiarism in introduction part? </p>

<p>Note: The primary sources are not previous studies on my local research area. They are like descriptions on that field. One of them is reasons of illness and the other one is statistical numbers of sport. Actually i gave the statistical number a bit different like ""more than 150 m"" instead of ""180 m"" and I was specific like ""who are older than 20 years old"". And also for reasons of illness, i gave different reference for ref1 but ref3 kept constant. To be specific; reasons of illness can be described by a doctor easly. </p>

<p>Here, total number of sentences is two.</p>

<p>For example in following link; we see that APA style says that we need to give original reference.</p>

Web scraping/email harvesting to contact survey respondents,"<p>I'm working on a research project that includes a survey of academics in a specific field. One method we've discussed for building a sample frame and obtaining contact information for potential respondents involves using web scraping to automatically obtain email addresses from various University websites. Names would be obtained by downloading citations for papers related to our topic, then we would use a script to search the web for email addresses that match those names. I'm not sure that this is an appropriate method for obtaining contact information, and have found some sources online that suggest my hunch is correct. However, most discussion of these methods relates to marketing research, rather than an academic context.</p>

<p>What do you think? Are there rules or guidance about this that I haven't found (I've read the CASRO and ESOMAR guidelines for research market which suggest that web scraping/email harvesting is not appropriate). </p>
",103978,16-02-2018 18:08,"Ethics of scraping ""public"" data sources to obtain email addresses","<p>I am wondering whether the following research practice is ethical.</p>

<p>A software engineering researcher downloads source code repositories from <a href=""https://github.com"">Github</a>, a large source of publicly available open source code.  The researcher searches the git commit logs to find email addresses of software developers who have committed to a project, and uses these email addresses to send them an email asking them to participate in a survey.  If the recipient clicks on the link to the survey, the survey contains an appropriate briefing and obtains informed consent.  The researcher follows all institutional and legal requirements related to human subjects research.  The researcher limits the number of emails sent to only the number of participants they think they will need to test their hypotheses.  However, at least one recipient of this email is annoyed that the researcher obtained their email address in this fashion and sent them unsolicited email.</p>

<p>Is this an ethical research practice?  In particular, what would be the relevant ethical principles or ethical framework for analyzing this question?  I've read a bunch of papers and backgrounders on ethics in human subject research and in engineering research, but they seem focused on other issues.  Are there accepted norms or guidelines relating to this sort of situation?  Has it been considered in other fields, such as the social sciences?</p>

<p>A possible argument that the practice is ethical: The data source is publicly available, and the email addresses were collected from this publicly available data.  Developers chose to make their software repository publicly available, and they should assume that any information contained in it are public.  Developers who don't want to be contacted could have configured their git client specially to use a different email address.  The research will benefit our understanding of the science of software development.  Subjects have an opportunity to decide whether or not to participate in the survey.  Participant confidentiality will be protected, and all responses will be treated anonymously.  The research complies with all legal and compliance requirements.  From a legal perspective, the emails are not ""spam"", since the unsolicited email was not sent for a commercial purpose.</p>

<p>A possible argument that the practice is unethical: Software developers probably would not expect someone to scrape email addresses from the git commit logs.  Their email address might be contained in a publicly available data set, but some developers might expect/consider the information private, or at least not public and free for unrestricted use.  Some developers might object that it is one thing to use email addresses that are publicly listed on their Github profile page, but it is another thing to extract private email addresses that are provided as part of their git configuration, and that their understanding of social norms is that the email addresses automatically inserted into the commit logs by their git client were not intended for this purpose.  Some software developers might object to having an unwanted email message in their inbox or find the practices ""creepy"".</p>

<hr>

<p>Please note: I am not asking about IRBs, legal requirements, or compliance.  I am super-familiar with those considerations.  Assume that the researcher has complied faithfully with all of those requirements that are applicable in their country.  I'm not asking about that aspect.  In my view, researchers have an independent obligation to conduct research in an ethical manner, and to exercise their own judgement in avoiding unethical behavior, even if is legally permitted or approved by an IRB.</p>

Paper claims that there is no solution for a problem I solved. Should I approach authors or editor first if I want that information to be included?,"<p>This question is the result of a discussion in <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/77461/can-intentionally-omitting-related-work-citations-be-considered-as-misconduct"">another question</a>. If I publish an article, solving a problem, or finding relevant data, and subsequently another article gets published, <strong>explicitly stating that the problem is unsolved, or that there are no relevant data</strong>, what should I do?</p>

<p>Should I contact the editor of the journal where the second paper was published, to inform him that the paper is faulty? Would authors take exception to the fact that I didn't bring up the matter with them first? And would the right thing to do be to talk to the authors first, even if they can't find out who brought the matter to the editor's attention? Do I owe it to the editor, or to the academic community as a whole, to try to get the paper changed as quickly as I can by going directly to the editor? And does the answer depend on whether I believe that the authors acted in good faith or not?</p>

<hr>

<p>Anything below this line is not part of my question and just justification for asking it.</p>

<p>Note that this question is about a specific bit of advice given in an answer in the other question, which I find questionable. As such, obviously this question has an answer in the other question. My question is whether that specific bit of advice is correct. Obviously the answer that prompted me to ask this question says so.</p>

<p>However, the point of the the other question is not to find out whether that specific advice is correct, and so there is no mechanism there for</p>

<p>a) showing agreement or disagreement for this bit of advice or any rival advice as to how to proceed (since the question is not about how to proceed in the first place.)</p>

<p>b) posting answers and/or thoughts about the correct way to proceed (since that question is not about how to proceed in the first place.)</p>

<p>So there is no way to extract any useful information from the fact that that answer has X votes: Was it given the votes because of or inspite of that bit of advice? Would people upvote the opposite course of action? Who knows. So I see some value in posting it as a separate question.</p>

<p>Feel free to remove this part once it has been decided whether this question is valid or already answered.</p>

<p>Another line: Why this is not a duplicate of <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/49208/recently-published-paper-does-not-cite-my-very-relevant-work"">Recently published paper does not cite my very relevant work</a>: That question deals with the issue of plagiarism and asks for specific advice if you suspect this happening. The answers there advise to do nothing. My question is for the case that the authors explicitly and wrongly state that there is no research or data available, and I have (for good or for ill) chosen to take action to get this factually incorrect point to be corrected. My question is not ""What should I do if people don't cite me?"", my question is ""If I already have decided to make it known that the paper is wrong in claiming that it offers the first, or only, solution to a problem, and am trying to get that changed, would the correct way of going about be alerting the authors that the claim they made is wrong, or should I write directly to the editor.""

Legality and feasibility of digitizing old text books and course notes for private use,"<p>I have finished university already some years ago, and am now working in the field of my previous studies. I was always very careful, diligent and organized when it came to collecting and archiving my course notes and course text books. </p>

<p>Well, in the current situation, I have all these notes and books stored at my parents' attic. However, quite often at work, I remember some of the content I studied and think ""well, that would be quite useful now to know"" or ""I did a case study at school that was very similar to my current project - what did we do back in the days?"". I can even point to the specific book or course, where the topic was covered. However, I cannot look up anything because they are physically stored somewhere in a geographically remote place.</p>

<p>So I have been asking myself repeatedly: ""why don't you digitize your course notes, text books, hand-outs, etc.?""</p>

<ol>
<li>Has anyone of you similar issues? <strong>How did you handle it</strong>?</li>
<li>Is it even <strong>legal</strong> to scan full text books for private use? I would store them in my Dropbox and do not intend to share with anyone. Of course, there is always the risk that my account gets hacked and files leaked, but I definitely do not have the intention to share any of these files (also, I do not know how probable this threat scenario is, given that I use two-factor-authentication). It is only and exclusively intended for my private use.</li>
<li>Is it even <strong>feasible</strong> to scan dozens of books and folders full of notes and print-outs?</li>

It is a book of worked solutions for a math textbook. It has no digital version, presumably to prevent people form distributing it online.</p>

<p>Since it would be much more convenient for me to have a digital copy, would it be okay to scan a copy of the book to keep with me, strictly for personal use? By ""okay"", I am asking more about its legality than its ethicality, preferably in the US.</p>

<hr>

<p>Although I probably intended this question to be more general, here is the information for this specific book. </p>

<p>There is a disclaimer related to copying in the front page of the book, which says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Except as permitted by the Copyright Act (any fair dealing for the purposes of private study, research, criticism or review), no part of this publication may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system, or transmitted in any form or by any means, electronic, mechanical, photocopying, recording or otherwise, without the prior permission of the publisher. Any enquiries are to be made to the [publishing company].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first part of this statement seems to suggest it might be allowed <em>for private study,</em> which seems to be the situation I am in.</p>

<p>One other notice that can be found in the book, right below the above notice:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Copying for educational purposes: Where copies of part or the whole of the book are made under Part VB of the Copyright Act, the law requires that the educational institution or the body that administers it has given a remuneration notice to Copyright Agency Limited (CAL). For information, contact the Copyright Agency Limited.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Part VB of the Copyright does not seem to apply to me as I am not a teacher (I am not a lawyer, either!). Is my only option in this case to contact the Copyright Agency or the publishers? I assume that if there is no resolution, I would have to try to obtain permission specifically from the publisher, which seems to be the safest option.</p>

What are the downsides (if any) of having a PhD to work in the software industry? Any about having technology certifications?,"<p>So you can take me seriously, let me first introduce myself: I am a PhD student about to finish my thesis and, thinking about future employment, I am considering to obtain an Oracle Java Certification, ammong other things.</p>

<p>The question I ask may sound odd, but I found this comic: <a href=""http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=56"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=56</a></p>

<p>Apparently, having a PhD is considered as a downside when applying for a job in the <strong>software industry</strong>. I don't see how that may be funny, and the reason behind it. </p>

<p>Moreover, and actually what made me make this question here: having taken a course in a technology is considered much worse, for instance, than having grammar errors in the resume or mentioning your skills using MS Word. One guy even say ""The point about certifications is dead-on"". Other person comments ""For most of the good Cisco certifications you HAVE to take the course, otherwise you will epic fail"". </p>

<p>This make me wonder if the problem is to had taken the course to get the certification, not the certification itself. Maybe they mean that showing in your CV that you completed a 10 hours online course on ""Starting with C language"" is perhaps not a good idea. Otherwise I don't understand. </p>

<p>I hope someone can shed some light on this.</p>

Changing major after BS and MS in CS and double major in Physics for PhD in Mathematics,"<p>Before telling about my background, I'd like to say that I did look at several similar questions, but neither involved my case (at least, not as far as I could see). </p>

<p>Now the background: I majored in Computer Engineering. I have expected more of Computer Science, but it was mostly business-oriented coding education (maybe I am being a little too harsh on this). So in my second year, I applied for a double major in Physics, thinking it might be more satisfying. In fact, I did enjoy Physics more than CS (or, CE in my case), and found it much more challenging and meaningful.</p>

<p>However, I ended up finishing my main major (CE), before Physics, so I applied for MS in CE in the same university, feeling the workload might be too little otherwise. I got accepted, and am currently enrolled in this program while taking 2-3 courses left from undergraduate Physics program. (My subject in MS is Computer Vision.)</p>

<p>But one thing I noticed over these years is that, for Physics I do not feel like I have the right mindset (seems that I lack a practical approach to things), and CE feels a little meaningless. Considering that I focused on Mathematical Physics, and more of the mathematical stuff in CS, I thought maybe Mathematics is the right place for me. But I cannot yet tell if I genuinely want Maths, or just whining about what I have at my hands. </p>

<p>So I have two questions, actually:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What are my chances if I apply for PhD in Number Theory?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you recommend changing the field? Can you share other people's experiences in similar cases?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For the application part, I must add that I do not have an outstanding transcript in neither of my majors (around 3.4 GPA in both fields -Physics might be around 3.5 too), although I did get a paper published which was about relativistic quantum mechanics. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> This question is different from what is suggested as duplicate as this particularly involves the case of a double major background. Specifically, whether the case of double major suggests the admission committee a versatility in working different fields or not. So I do not think this should be regarded as a duplicate question.</p>

<p><strong>Edit2:</strong> <em>Experience in proofs</em><br>
I have taken Discrete Mathematics and Formal Languages and Abstract Machines, in which we mostly used induction to prove things. Apart from that, in the mathematical methods courses we have gone through the proofs of Stokes' theorem, divergence theorem, etc. Although I mostly can understand a proof reading through it, and working out some things that seem off, I would not say that I am good at mathematical proofs, nor that I am much experienced with them.</p>

"Is first authorship a big deal (in terms of highlighting it on CV, etc.)?","<p>From August 2015 through August 2016 I was on a Nuclear/Radiation Physics based work placement in a scientific research institute, between my second and third years of my university Maths degree. I am now back at university, half way through my third year.</p>

<p>About half way through my work placement (which I thoroughly enjoyed), my supervisor suggested that the work I was doing could be considered publishable. Being an undergraduate this was (and is) obviously a very exciting prospect. It turned out that we did decide to write a paper, and my supervisor said to be that I would get to be the first author. I don't understand much, but I'm under the impression that's something to be excited about too.</p>

<p>I finished with all the analysis and wrote a draft of the paper. It was then time for me to leave my placement and my (now ex-)supervisor are still in correspondence, whilst he finalizes the paper. There have been various (unrelated) issues which have held him back from spending time on it - but he suspects (as it stands) that he will <em>possibly</em> finish it and submit it to a journal by the end of February. He's basically completely reformatting a lot of the paper, and probably rewriting a whole bunch of it, because being an undergraduate I have no idea how to write a paper. Of course this means that if I do turn out to be first author, my supervisor has probably been very generous.</p>

<p>Long story short - if things go well and the paper is accepted in whichever journal, is this a big deal or nothing to be so bothered about? I ask basically to figure out where this ranks in terms of putting it on a C.V. (or something). Is this something to simply add on as an achievement, or something to really highlight? </p>

<p>I understand my question is really rather ambiguous. Essentially I'm really not sure what to expect under the circumstances that the paper is published - if anything.</p>
",83547,20-01-2017 05:59,What does first authorship really mean?,"<p>In my field (theoretical computer science), authors of any paper are always listed alphabetically; our papers <a href=""http://www.ams.org/profession/leaders/culture/CultureStatement04.pdf"">don't have ""first authors""</a>.  (Well... hardly ever.)  In most other disciplines, at least within science and engineering, the ordering of authors is a signal about their relative contributions to the paper, with the first author indicating the most significant contributor.  Hiring and promotion committees do give extra weight to ""first-author papers"" (and sometimes have to be reminded that not all areas have them).  As an outsider, I find this practice confusing.</p>

<p><strong>What does first authorship actually mean in your discipline?</strong> I understand vaguely that the first author is supposed to be the one who ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_author"">did the most work</a>"", but what counts as ""work"" in this comparison?  Does ""most"" mean ""more than all the other coauthors together"" or just ""more than any other coauthor""?  What happens when the comparison is unclear?   How often is ""did the most work"" the actual truth, versus a cover story for a more complex political decision?</p>

<p>I realize that the precise answer is different for every paper.  <strong>I'm looking for general guidelines</strong> for how an outsider (like me) should interpret first authorship <em>in your field</em>.  Pointers to guidelines from journals or professional societies would be especially helpful.</p>

I had no time to publish these paper before I graduate. I put my supervisor's name there because he was my supervisor. I didn't really contribute to the paper. </p>

<p>I'm sure the 10 paper can be published as high quality journal paper because I'm currently working as a staff in another University. I've published a lot paper expect for those 10 so I know what paper can be published. But as the coauthor, my ex-supervisor ""refused"" to publish these paper. He always told me he needed to have a look, and nothing else happened. Every time I contact him, he would propose some unreasonable questions or tell me to wait for some time to put off the publication and no reply at all after that. It has been 2 years up to now. None of my 10 paper has been submitted yet. He obviously doesn't need the paper as a professor, but I need them desperately as a new lecture. </p>

<p>I've waited for 2 years for the first out of the 10 paper to be submitted. I couldn't wait for 20 years for the 10 paper to be submitted. He doesn't say he want to delete his name from this paper but I have sufficient reason to believe that he doesn't want me to publish these paper. He warned me that I couldn't submit the paper without his agreement otherwise he would withdraw the paper. My question is can I kick him out from the coauthor list and publish the paper by myself? Or is there any other suggestion say contacting the University about this situation to solve the problem? </p>

",83766,24-01-2017 16:37,Co-author contributed almost nothing and is blocking publication,"<p>Alice and Bob have co-authored a paper together. The contribution (data collection, analysis, writing) was 100% Alice and 0% Bob, except that the original idea was initiated during a conversation between Alice and Bob. Bob acknowledged several times in private that he did not contribute to the project, but he claimed co-authorship for the idea and Alice did not object to that. Alice spent almost an entire year working on the project. Bob spent less than a couple of hours in total. A manuscript with both names has already been circulated, submitted and rejected from one journal.</p>

<p>Bob is now trying to block the publication of the paper due to a personal conflict with Alice. In the meantime, Bob became envious of Alice's early successes and decided to do everything to slow down her career, even at the expense of his own publication record. Bob is already tenured and has no pressure to publish. Alice, by contrast, needs more publications for her forthcoming tenure review. Of course, Bob never explicitly refused to submit the paper. But instead of sending it to a prestigious outlet (where the paper would have a good shot) he insists that they send the manuscript to a non peer-reviewed and unknown journal, which would not help Alice's tenure case. Of course he makes no effort in trying to find an agreement, as he would be happy not to submit the paper at all. Clearly, his decisions are driven by spite and malevolence only and he takes great care into not writing anything incriminating for him.</p>

<p>Is there anything that Alice can do in that situation? Does she have to resign herself to never publishing the paper? What are the risks for her if she removes Bob's name without his agreement and submits the manuscript on her own?</p>

<p>PS: as a response to Captain Emacs' comment, Bob's only contribution was to say ""why don't we study the causal effect of X on Y?"" in an informal conversation. Alice did absolutely all the rest (literature review, design of the protocol, data collection, analysis, conference presentations, etc.). But there is no evidence of this, other than the fact that Bob would be unable to answer any question that goes into the detail of the paper.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>IJAICR is a referred [sic] journal in the field of computer science, artificial intelligence and soft computing methods.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was accepted two days after we submitted it. That's too fast. We were suspicious. Although the journal said that all papers are peer-reviewed, we could not see how that was done in two days. Plus, we received no comments from the reviewers. Also, the submission guidelines didn't ask for a ""blind"" copy (without our names or any references to who we were). </p>

<p>But wait, there's more.</p>

<p>The acceptance letter asked us to send them US$300 to publish it. We did not. We've withdrawn our submission and will submit a new version of the paper to a more reputable journal in the coming months.</p>

How do I use potentially copyrighted images in my course material?,"<p>I teach at a school and I create PowerPoint presentations to use in my classroom.  I also need to upload the PowerPoints to my school website for my students to access.  Access is restricted and students must sign in with their school codes.

To be able to attract the young generation to science one has to connect the concepts with everyday applications.</p>

<p>So I build my power point slides using pictures from the textbooks which we officially use. Unfortunately when one does a Google search on any subject by images, one gets much more appealing and fascinating pictures. Some of these pictures are even related to simple applications which are explained in popular science sites on very recent discoveries. The problem is that I cannot use those pictures from Google sites in my slides because they are copyrighted.</p>

<p>What should I do then? Should I stick to the boring-looking textbook pics to avoid copyright problems, or bring life to my course by using images Google shows up (but then I might go to the jail!)?</p>

How to address professors in emails?,"<p>I have been greeting all my professors as ""Professor (last name)"" in emails I send to them. I think this is normal, but at my university all the professors/lecturers use their first name when ending emails they send.</p>

<p>For example, if the teacher's name was ""Joe Smith"", they might end an email they send as follows:</p>

<p>Regards,
Joe</p>

<p>This behavior is the case with all of the professors I've had, so it seems to be something that's global to the university. Should I be addressing my professors by their first name in emails? I would have done so already, but I don't want to sound disrespectful. I've looked it up but haven't found any guidelines my university gives on addressing faculty.</p>

Does a lecturer have the right to prevent students from making their notes public?,"<p>A lecturer does not make slides or lecture notes available (e.g. on the course website) in an effort to force students to show up at lectures. </p>

<p>However, many students learn the material just fine without attending each and every lecture. It also seems unethical to force us all to show up, even though the attendance is not a requirement because we may just choose to do something else and there is no rule against it.</p>

<p>As a response, some of us have decided to write extensive notes together and put them up on a filesharing website, and we've notified other students of this using the course websites' discussion forum. The lecturer has now messaged one of us (the one who made the post on the forum) and told him to stop doing this.</p>

In December before the holidays I asked a professor I used to work with during my BSc to write one for me and she agreed to do it saying she'd do it over the holidays. The holidays passed and I emailed her shortly after but she didn't reply (normally she replies super fast to my emails). I gave her a call a week after I sent this email and she said that she hasn't forgotten about it and she worked on it the weekend before so I should receive it no later than the day after our phone call. This was last week on Monday already and I still haven't heard back from her. How do I politely remind her about the letter? Is it rude to email her about it?

Publication issue of a journal article in Elsevier,"<p>Recently, an article of mine got accepted in an Elsevier Journal. Since it was my first publication, I was not very much aware of the whole publication procedure. After acceptance of the paper, I got a link sent for gallery proof. At this stage, I found many grammatical mistakes in the paper, which I should have corrected during the revision stage. I have to agree that I was late regarding this matter. Yet, I incorporated all the extensive corrections and sent back the proof. The journal manager was helpful. He sent me a pdf file with all the corrections incorporated and asked me to approve the revised proof, which I did. Recently, I contacted Elsevier's customer support, whereby I got to know that the paper is in type-setting. It made me a bit confused because the pdf file I got from the journal manager was already corrected and type-setted. </p>

<p>So my question is how could be the paper in the typesetting stage if I have got a prepared pdf file of the revised proof for approval from the journal manager!! If anyone of you is familiar with this scenario, I would appreciate your feedback.</p>

"Quit PhD two years ago, now I want to go back?","<p>I quit my Ph.D. two years ago because of multiple reasons but largely due to my own naiveness over deciding to enroll for a Ph.D. I decided to do a Ph.D. without knowing anything about it. I wasn't prepared at all. I wrongly chose a lab that has a very poor vision for any scientific advancement. I foolishly chose a supervisor who had no idea what's going on in his lab. Once I understood this, I also became aware of my own weakness that has resulted in not getting me an ideal lab. This realization happened very lately and until now I had already developed a strong vision for my research project and my future career. And according to my plan, it wasn't that lab or supervisor who was going to help me to reach my goal. In academia, everything is connected, so if I wasn't going to be the best version of myself in Ph.D., the chances of finding a better opportunity after my Ph.D. was very less. So I decided to quit my Ph.D. and start it all over again; only this time knowing everything about a research career and how to excel in it. I wanted to become the best and for that, I had to work on myself first. So, a six month gap period was planned after leaving my Ph.D. But this gap time became much longer (because of some unfortunate circumstances); almost two years now and I have started feeling like a failure. I really want to go back and do some quality research. What is the best way to do it?

",143619,30-01-2020 14:55,Going back to academia after quitting my Ph.D. and taking a year off?,"<p>I am a Ph.D. dropout with a one year of career gap. I want to return to academia, but now  I have realized that it was perhaps the biggest mistake to take a gap after quitting my Ph.D. The purpose of taking a gap was to work on my communication skills and get a  new perspective on my work and my career in science. This could have been done within a period of 2-3 months but it became one year long because of my own recklessness. I allowed myself to distract from my goal and I started working on my hobby i.e. Painting. I lost myself there and completely lost track of my time. I was really enjoying everything about this new venture. I took it as a challenge to become better at my skills in painting. Eventually, I became the best in my group and got lots of appreciation. But then, I lost my interest while realizing that there was no further challenge and all there was left is to work and work while crafting your art which was never going to be perfect. It made me realize that what I actually love is to take the new challenges and work on myself. To be an artist was never a career option for me, all I wanted was to learn the skills. That's it! </p>

<p>While counting my achievement in science, I  realized that it was an irresponsible thing to take a gap in doing something that has nothing to do with science. Earlier I had a scholarship and a very competitive mind that has led me to get a Ph.D. position in one of the best labs in the country. Now I don't have the scholarship. I want to go back to my world of research where I was accelerating exponentially. I want to tackle the challenges of science with a new perspective and better skills. I want to be productive more than earlier and ready to take all the tough challenges. 
But I feel embarrassed about my past mistake. Because of this, I come across as someone who is not sincere about her career. But I can't help it because the truth is that I did behave insincerely by losing track of my time.  I should have been conscious enough to realize the consequences. Now, what do I do? The past has gone and the vision of the present is crying for a better future. How do I make things better like before?</p>

How long does it take for the final editorial decision for an article?,"<p>My case can be explained as below:
Day 1: first submission 
Day 60: I got the first decision suggesting revision. The 3 reviewer’s comments were positive and 2 of them asked to make some minor changes and suggested some clarifications. 
Day 90: I submitted the revised article
Day 100: status changes to under review
Day 114: status changed to ready for decision 
Day 130: status updated again to ready for decision and is still the same</p>

<p>I was going through the latest issues in the journal and I saw papers that have been accepted so far got their decision within 10 days of the “revised” date that shows (a lot of those revised dates were later than my Day 100 and even Day 114). What does this long waiting time indicate in my case? Am I looking at an imminent rejection?</p>

"Imminent unemployment, I have a screwed up CV; incompetent in my own field of PhD. Hoping for some perspective and advise?","<p>I did my PhD recently and it took 5.5 years to complete. I had just 2 courses in my PhD, so the timeline is excessive owing to my lack of motivation during my 2-3rd year. </p>

<p>I have also not taken any advanced graduate level courses in my PhD and am entirely relying on my publications for portraying my quantitative, technical and programming experience. </p>

<p>I had changed my field from materials engineering (undergrad) to mechanical engineering during PhD. But, I did not take any courses to address the lack of technical background (advanced mathematics and computational fluid dynamics).</p>

<p>My research was not that rigorous programming and technicality wise. So, I kind of survived through it. Studying other publications, self studying concepts through books was enough.</p>

<p>But now, since I have graduated, I am finding it severely uncomfortable to apply for positions that seek a different more rigorous job description.</p>

<p>I think, I made some terrible decisions along the way. I should have taken the courses as that would have built up my confidence. </p>

<p>On top of that, I have no job experience or internship experience. I have lost hope on academia and chances in industry appears slim too. </p>

Dealing with 'less than optimal' data or study designs,"<p>I am a PhD student in a quantitative social science field. For the first study of my dissertation, I was given the opportunity to ask some questions that could be applied to an ongoing survey. Affiliated researchers have already used some of this data for a short commentary/descriptive article, and there is interest to apply the data in a slightly different 'modelling' study.</p>

<p>However, the underlying study design leaves much to be desired. Although the sample is relatively large, it is a convenience sample from only a fraction of all possible survey sites in the population. There is no opportunity to expand the data collection process. The data itself is unlikely to have measurement error, but almost any estimate produced from the dataset is highly likely to suffer from sampling bias.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I realize this is a somewhat 'common' situation graduate student find themselves in. There is active interest from the affiliated partners to carry out the study, the design isn't 'ideal', and there are logistical considerations of invested time (or as I see it, sunk cost fallacy).</p>

<p><strong>While I have many questions, I think the most straightforward is: should I attempt to make 'lemonade out of lemons' or 'stand my ground' that such a modelling study would be inappropriate?</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Supervisor is 'ardent' that such a study should be carried out</li>
<li>I have sought out external input as to what methods would be 'most' appropriate, there are some that might be 'less' worrisome than others  </li>

Is there more prestige publishing in a special or regular issue?,"<p>Bit of a random thought, as publishing in either is good of course. I do not intend to demean anyone who has published in special issues.</p>

<p>I can think of pros and cons from one to the other:</p>

<p>Special issues may get more exposure from people searching within a collection. However, these tend to be offered through invitation, which often or not, the submitted paper may less likely be rejected. This means the quality has a potential to be of lower standard.</p>

<p>Regular issues in this instance may be harder to get accepted, especially in high impact journals, as many researchers will try to submit their work to the journal. Would this mean some people view special issues from invitations as a ""free paper""? Where publications in regular issues may be more ""genuine""?</p>
",143870,06-02-2020 04:59,Prestige of publishing in special vs regular journal issue,"<p>Some journals bundle relevant papers on a currently hot topic into special issues. As far as I know, potential manuscripts must be specifically submitted for inclusion in special issues rather than the journal itself (or get selected from conference proceedings).</p>

<p>In my field, special issues tend to have shorter review periods which makes them interesting venues. I have heard that special issues tend to have lower impact than regular journal issues, though I am not sure if this is factual. Do special issues usually meet the same standards as regular issues?</p>

<p>Is there any difference in prestige in publishing in special issues vis-à-vis publishing in regular issues? Do hiring committees make meaningful distinctions between both types?</p>

Rejecting a offer after accepting it (PhD US - Europe),"<p>I recently was offered a PhD position at a prestigious university in  Europe (ETH), but the project is in a subject indirectly related to my field. I actually focused on applications mostly in the US, because they are directly related to my field, and US suits me for personal reasons. Europe is great as well, but I have only a week to let them know of my decision. The decisions in the US don't come until March or April, and I feel bad that if a better offer comes from the US, I will probably reject the present one. Is it possible to do so?  </p>

I have told the project supervisor I accept it. In the meanwhile I have managed to secure a PhD offer from another 2 universities much better in world rankings and with better research groups and better faculty. Additionally these 2 universities do research exactly on what I want to devote my PhD research.</p>

<p>My only commitment to the first university is a mail confirming I accept. Nothing else. I understand declining the offer after already having accepted it is quite dishonest but it is a huge decision that will affect my future in a very significant level. </p>

<p>I would like your opinion and I would also like to ask for possible consequences of such an action. As far a postdocs concerned, in the first university there is no chance I ever get a postdoc since they do not actually do research on my area (except for the prospective supervisor and even he not as much).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
I have decided to do as I was afraid to. I have decided to choose a different university than the first one that I have already accepted the offer. My offer acceptance included: </p>

<ul>
<li>An online ""I accept"" statement.</li>
<li>An e-mail I sent stating ""I accept the scholarship and this University is my first option""</li>
</ul>

<p>I do not have any legal commitments since I have not signed anything. The supervisor of the first university though is really nice to me and continuously was sending me mails. <strong>How do I very nicely tell her I will not be joining in the end?</strong> Additionally the place I will go in the end will be for research in Mathematics and not Physics. Can I use this as a part of a sensical excuse?</p>

<p>I think that I should let people, especially other beginning grad students know what happened with my case. I have chosen to nicely tell the first university I got accepted that I will not be attending and will not be pursuing a PhD there since I decided I have different research interests (which is true). I had applied there in the first place since I was not sure what I wanted to do and because it was a nice program. Despite that, I got an offer from a World top university to work on 100% my research interests. I explained this to them, the first uni, and they happily let me go and wished me good luck, especially the supervisor who faught a lot secure me funding. I was lucky.</p>

Are (computer science) workshops less prestigious than conferences in general?,"<p>I am a PhD student in computer science and I have noticed that my advisor tries to avoid having me submit to workshops in my field when I bring workshops to his attention that we could submit to. He, instead, prefers to publish in a conference, journal, or IEEE/ACM magazine instead. I almost feel like he treats workshops as not prestigious enough.</p>

<p>The workshops I bring to his attention are all good workshops in my opinion. These workshops are IEEE and ACM workshops demanding original research papers that are about 6 pages long (conference papers in my field are usually 8 to 10 pages long). The program committees for these workshop are known people in my field and previous year's workshop papers have a 5 or 6 citations (for example), so they do get attention (but I don't know how this compares to the attention that this same paper could have gotten if it was published at a conference).</p>

Questions on graduate programs for Mathematics,"<p>I am an undergraduate Junior at UW Madison and I am finding myself really enjoying my recently declared mathematics major. I am exploring what it may look like for me to study math beyond a bachelors'. I was hoping that some grad students in Math, whether they are PhD or Masters, could answer some questions for me.</p>

<p>First and foremost, my GPA is not the best right now. I have heard that, especially in mathematics, admission can be competitive.</p>

<p><strong>Current:
 Cumulative - 2.98,
Math - 3.27</strong></p>

<p>I have had some mental health challenges in my time in college, as well as other challenges that a typical student doesn't have to face, including a loss of financial support from my family last year. Many of these things took a toll on my grades in my early years here. However I have rebounded and aced both of my classes last semester, and my current classes are going very well and I expect the trend to continue. I also think that, if I do apply to graduate programs, I could speak to my resilience in facing these matters, and how I am surviving and even thriving being a fully financially self supporting 21 year old student at a major university.  </p>

<p><em>One question I have is, will these admissions comittees hear my story and listen to me? Will they see my time here as a marker of resilience and perseverance given my context, or will they simply see the numbers and look past this context?</em></p>

<p>So, I have 42 credits until I graduate. At most 27 of these credits could be math classes.</p>

<p>Based on this, I have estimated what my grades might look like if I keep doing well in my classes, with some error factored in.</p>

<p><strong>Predicted (mid range estimate): Cumulative 3.1, Math - 3.5</strong></p>

<p>So there is a solid estimate of what my GPA may look like once I graduate. Given that, I am somewhat concerned as to how the admissions process may look like for me just from what I hear about it. I think that I would be OK with going to an ""average"" program, as long as I can get funding for it.</p>

<p>So, here is one question!</p>

<p><em>Where can I find fully or mostly funded graduate programs for mathematics that aren't so strict on GPA requirements?</em></p>

<p>Another question I have. My current professor told me to do a Masters before doing a PHD to see if I like it. However, I have heard that many masters programs are NOT funded! I don't want to take out more loans, So,</p>

<p><em>Where can I find masters programs in math that are mostly or fully funded?</em></p>

<p>As far as location, I am open to considering all options.</p>

<p>From my own research into PHD programs, I've read that, although it is competitive, that admissions committees do take a somewhat holistic approach. Madison's program even states that they weigh letters of rec higher than grades. And, I am aware that a good GRE score could help a lot too.</p>

<p>Given that,</p>

<p><em>From experience, can mathematics graduate students speak to this notion? Is it true that all factors are considered, or are some weighed more heavily than others? I understand this is likely different from university to university, but personal experience and knowledge would be valuable to me!
Given my current and predicted GPA, what do math grads think I should strive for? Should GPA even be a concern of mine, or should I instead focus on, for example, building strong relationships with faculty, or exploring undergraduate research?
On that note, what are things I can do now, besides working on my GPA, to increase my ""job security"" for getting accepted into a grad program?</em></p>

<p>As for why I want to do a PHD: math is my primary academic strength, and it's something I really enjoy. Research sounds like it has the potential to be a highly engaging activity for me, and I love to learn and create new ideas.</p>

<p>Being a professor sounds cool, but I've heard the job market is tough, so right now I would say my primary motivation might be for the education and research experience, perhaps something with applied mathematics. But, theoretical and seeking professorships isn't off the table! I've still got a ways to go until I graduate (I'm a part time student so 42 credits will take me a bit longer than a full timer)</p>

How should I interpret advisor overly positive feedbacks?,"<p>I am currently in the writing phase of my master thesis in a US-based university. Almost all of the feedback I am receiving from my advisor is either linguistic suggestions or just positive supportive kinda of a language. I am the primary investigator from my thesis. </p>

<p>For instance, two months ago, I noticed that I had made a mistake in my code that invalidated about 6 months of work. She wasn't even mad, saying things like ""everyone makes mistakes"" and ""we can fix this."" I was able to redo the analysis and still find interesting results, so it did more or less work out. But this is just one example of how positive she is. </p>

<p>Last year she encouraged me to apply to an university internal poster session and strongly suggested that it was highly probable that I would win one of the prizes offered. I did not win, nor do I feel like I was that close to winning. I was a first year student competing against fourth and fifth years. </p>

<p>Additionally, she is always happy with whatever I present to her. I'll admit, some weeks I do not produce much work, sometimes I'm slow to give her abstracts to review for conferences, etc, but she is always happy with whatever I give her. </p>

<p>She praises me excessively for every little thing, no matter how good or bad. She says ""excellent work, great job, you're making fantastic progress."" I get the same exact level of praise on the weeks I do a lot of work and weeks I do little work. </p>

<p>I'm used to working with PIs were much more blunt. Not necessarily negative, but told me how I was doing. If I didn't do much work, they would say ""that's all you've done?"" However, if I actually did a good job, I would get a ""good job"" or something. </p>

<p>It's very hard for me to manage my expectations with my advisor. I don't know if I am actually doing a good job or not. I don't know what my approximate actual chances are for awards and acceptances to conferences. </p>

I was given to review a journal paper that overlaps with a submitted paper of ours,"<p>I was recently given to review a journal paper that significantly overlaps with a work that we recently submitted to a conference (about half of the contributions are the same).</p>

",125425,22-02-2019 21:45,A paper I received to review has (independently) duplicated work that we are writing up. How to proceed in light of peer-review confidentiality?,"<p>I did some research with some collaborators, and we have been writing an article (""paper A"") describing the work.</p>

<p>A few days ago I received a request to review an article (""paper B"") that covers most of our work. The authors of paper B have clearly worked independently on the same topic and beaten us to submission. (And fair play to them.)</p>

<p>This leads me to a number of related dilemmas:</p>

<p>The first, and I think easiest to resolve, is whether I have a conflict of interest in reviewing paper B. I think I can write a fair review, but I intend to tell the editor and allow them to decide whether I should proceed.</p>

<p>The other dilemmas arise mainly because I am bound by peer-review confidentiality. I should note that paper B is <em>not</em> available as a preprint.</p>

<p>Can tell my co-authors about paper B? I am convinced that confidentiality forbids me from <em>showing</em> paper B to them, but can I tell them that it exists and what it covers? My feeling is that the answer is 'no'.</p>

<p>But then, if I cannot tell my co-authors about paper B, then it seems I have to allow our paper A to proceed to submission even although I know of the overlap with paper B.</p>

<p>I am extremely uncomfortable with this, although one can take the view that since our work was independent, our paper A could still be published.</p>

<p>Furthermore, my first impression is that paper B is not suitable for the general journal to which it was submitted, but that I would recommend acceptance to a high-quality specialist journal, such as the one to which we intended to submit our paper A. This raises an unpleasant prospect: if our paper A proceeds to submission and publication, the authors of paper B might believe that I had rejected their paper and plagarized their work (a situation discussed in <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/3124/what-to-do-if-a-referee-plagiarises-the-result-after-rejecting-a-paper"">this question</a>). This situation could arise even if I turn down the review request. Naturally, I want to avoid this.</p>

What practicable alternative do I have to not fly around the globe to present a poster/pollute environment?,"<p>Popularizing your research and results is an important part of a non-tenured researcher, which alreday and often starts after graduating with a bachelor and proceeds up to being a postdoc for many years. While I don't question organization of conferences at all, observing that sometimes several researcher from one group fly to a conference, many only to present a poster sometimes, made me think, if there are alternatives to personally choose and practice as I'm also interested in the <a href=""https://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/HomePage"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Azimuth project</a>. I also remember from mail contacts with other researchers some of their signatures asking the recipient kindly ""to not print out this mail"" and increase its ecological footprint, as digitalization sadly increases paper consumption (tragic ""fun"" fact).</p>

<p>So my question is, what practicable best option/alternative do I have: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>asking colleague of my group with talk to hang up my poster/present it/point to mail/phone for interested viewers</p></li>
<li><p>directly mail-spam attendees of the conference (looking up program) I know from papers in my field before conference with a PDF version of my poster, not paying conference fee (which look to me often also rather like a business model also among important and renonwed conferences fostering so many predatory conferences I get notice in my spam folder, likely being financed in very costly conference venues by many ""poster-boys"")</p></li>
<li><p>not care about my ecological footprint because researchers are no role-models and just a very small number of the international air traffic. As said, I don't question talks and invited talks held in front of several dozen peers.</p></li>
<li><p>only present posters for few years to make my community aware of myself or only at nearby locations.</p></li>
<li><p>engage in online conferences (which seem totally unpopular, not in practice in my field of condensed matter physics, being no niche and staging dozens of conferences even in single subfields like magnetism, materials...)</p></li>
<li><p>...</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I know, there will be some disadvantages. Actually, the last idea originating from a discussion at a poster on the other side of the globe made me writing a granted research proposal which will finance my post-doc position and a PhD-student. But I think it would have been just a matter of more time and didn't need a flight around the world.</p>

<p>EDIT: I'm really looking for practicable tips one can apply now instead of waiting until the organization of conferences will hypothetically significantly change like <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/q/84184/41661"">in this related question</a>.

<p>How can this kind of academic interaction be accomplished remotely, i.e. without traveling?  How can remote participation in conferences be set up so as to approach the effectiveness of in-person attendance?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:</p>

<p>I would like to see someone discuss the choice of location.  I got this idea from the answer that mentioned Energy Star.  I once visited the Canary Islands and saw political graffiti saying ""no more concrete.""  I wonder if holding a conference in an area with poor urban planning, with explosive building patterns, would have a disproportional effect on local climate, species diversity, populations abandoning traditional farming and migrating to the city and underemployment... these are thoughts that are just starting to form.  I hope someone with a better understanding of these things can weigh in.  For example, is there a way to relate these factors to the technical component ""carbon footprint""?</p>

<p>What about how much food needs to be flown in?  For example, a conference held on an island that doesn't lend itself to producing fresh fruit, vs. a venue that can source more locally grown food?</p>

<p>Then there's fuel for heating and air conditioning, and gasoline for getting from the airport to the hotel.  I wonder whether conference organizers ever think about any of these considerations....</p>

<p>But I would still like to understand how remote participation can be shaped to yield similar benefits to in-person attendance.  Maybe it would help to form some small interest-based subgroups?</p>

As usual, I immediately checked the papers to find out if the authors were praising or criticising my work (or perhaps they found a mistake in one of my papers!). To my surprise, in one case the authors wrote a misleading statement which resulted from stretching quite a lot some of my conclusions. In the other case, the authors simply made an incorrect claim (details below for the curious). It's not the first time this happens to me - I even got one citation completely out of context once.

<li><p>In the first case, the authors cite a paper of mine where I compare two different methods to calculate elastic properties of materials. My main conclusion is that one of the methods converges much faster than the other one with the size of the basis set - in other words, it's computationally much cheaper. For calculations with usual basis sets the first method is much more accurate than the second one, with disagreements between the two in the order of 10% or even 20%. They claim that I show that both methods agree within a 1% of each other, which is misleading at best, because for the second method to agree within 1% of the first one one needs to do a very expensive calculation. That is one of the main points of the paper and it got completely overlooked by the authors.</p></li>
<li><p>In the second case, the citation is plainly wrong. The authors cite my paper as an experimental work on InGaN semiconductors while it actually is purely computational.</p></li>

What are the benefits and purpose of presenting a paper in an academic conference?,"<p>If i have completed all the research work and compiled a research article then why should I present that paper in a conference and not submit it to a good journal for publication ?</p>
",103826,14-02-2018 07:55,Conferences as publication venues – black and white or is there a grey or third way?,"<p>There are two ways of treating conferences that are commonly mentioned on this site:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Conferences are publication venues</strong> for papers (or similar). Submissions will be subjected to a serious peer review, are citable as evidence, and are a relevant achievement.
Submitting the same material to two different conferences or a journal and a conference would be considered self-plagiarism.</p>

<p>This applies to computer science and engineering (or at least some subfields thereof)
– for details, see: <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/q/40783/7734"">Is the status of conference publications in Computer Science really absolutely unique?</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conferences are not publication venues.</strong>
The material presented there is typically also published in journals, books, and similar – but this process is not tied to the conference; it may occur before the conference, later, or even not at all.
Submissions are only subjected to minimal review¹, are not citable as evidence, and not considered a big achievement.
Participating in conferences is still considered important though.
It is common that authors present the same material at different conferences.</p>

<p>This applies to the majority of fields.</p>

<p><sup>¹ to weed out utter crap or to decide what should be a talk and what a poster</sup></p></li>
</ul>

<p>In light of <a href=""https://academia.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3813/7734"">this Meta question</a>, I am interested whether the above two cases are the only two.
To me, it would not be surprising if this actually is the case, as the two categories have a self-preserving mechanisms.
For example, for a conference belonging to the first category, weakening the criteria for submission would usually be a bad move.
On the other hand, I am very well aware that I do not know every field’s customs.
Hence, I am asking: <strong>Are there conferences that hold a status not described by the two categories above?</strong>
Please answer only if you can name and describe such a conference – if this question remains unanswered, this would be an acceptable and meaningful outcome.</p>

<p>Note that this is only about what is submitted directly to the conference for the purpose of being presented there.
Whether articles corresponding to the presented material will be collected for a book, special issue of a journal, or other form of proceedings – be it with separate peer review or not – is irrelevant for the purposes of this question.</p>

How to manage imposter syndrome during the job hunt?,"<p>There are lots of questions on here about dealing with Imposter Syndrome throughout the whole Ph.D. experience.  I have struggled with Imposter Syndrome throughout my whole Ph.D., but was able to manage it through a supportive adviser who thinks the world of my work. However, this is changing now.  I am on the job hunt (graduating this spring with a Ph.D. in applied mathematics - my research is sort of straddling the line between applied math and computer science, although my masters and bachelors are both in pure math) and I am focused on teaching-oriented schools, and have a diverse teaching background (with overwhelmingly positive teaching evaluations).  </p>

<p>I have applied to many jobs.  I have gotten a decent number of first round interviews (phone, skype/zoom, conference interviews at the Joint Math Meetings) but only one on campus interview so far.  And still waiting to hear back from them (probably not the top candidate judging by the time).  The job most interested in me right now is a job I was qualified for with just my masters - and I only have unofficial word on that, hearing things through the grapevine.  There has also been countless rejections of the form-letter variety.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rambling.  Long story short, I struggled with Imposter Syndrome through the Ph.D., was built up by a supportive adviser and finally was feeling like I actually did belong in academia, and now the complete lack of job prospects is just making me feel like it was all a mistake somehow.  Somehow I slipped through this far, but nobody will actually want me on faculty.  </p>

<p>Those of you who have been here before - how did you personally deal with feeling not good enough after all this work?  The way I'm feeling is interfering with me finishing typing my dissertation, because I'm feeling like there is no point.  How can I snap out of this enhanced imposter syndrome?</p>

For me, this usually manifests in the thought: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>I've somehow convinced everyone into believing that I'm actually good at this.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>followed by the horrifying notion that eventually I'll be found out and my world will collapse. </p>

<p>I believe that the imposter syndrome is not uncommon in academia. I'm interested to know how other people here have experienced and dealt with it. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In particular, I'm looking for <strong>actual tactics</strong> that someone might
  use to combat imposter syndrome.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><em>Why I asked this question:</em></p>

<p>Beyond the obvious reason that this is something I have struggled with for many years and only recently gotten a handle on myself, there's also some evidence that merely realizing that other people experience imposter syndrome helps fellow imposters. As a grad student, I've managed to meet a fair number of people who are in their own struggles with imposter syndrome; however, the tactics and self-trickery that have helped me don't always speak to them and perhaps someone else's methods might. </p>

Should I include information about my mental health in my masters personal statements?,"<p>I graduated in 2016 with a 2:2, which I feel was lower than what I could have achieved.</p>

<p>I had had some minor issues before starting university, however I had an amazing support system and managed to get these in check. I completed my first year with only the normal issues (homesickness at first and adjusting to living away from home) until just before the end. I failed the last two exams of the year, partly due to the same issues that reoccurred later. </p>

<p>I had been struggling with one of my elective modules and after talking with my tutor, he recommended not worrying about it as I could fail 20 credits and as a 10 credit module, it would not affect my grade. However, the day of I woke up and completely panicked, zoning in and out all morning. I walked to the exam, and blanked and ended up in my department building instead of the exam hall, which was 20 minutes away and I had to run down a very steep hill to make it to the exam. But I made it and sat the exam.</p>

<p>I injured my knee while running. The problem with this is that my main coping method is exercise and I was on crutches. I then managed to completely space out for the last exam of the year. Meaning I failed both these modules, which was my 20 credit allowance. Despite this I averaged a high 2:1 for the year.</p>

<p>I went into my second year, with added roles and responsibilities. I had lived in catered accommodation in first year and moved to self catered in my second year. I became the social secretary of the physics society and started another sport (total of three) I had been a super human in my first year and wanted to do more. This turned out to be a bad idea, as my mental health started to decline, and my grades took a hit.</p>

<p>I then tried to pull them back up in my third year, but poor living conditions caused a physical health decline, which then exacerbated the mental health problems to a point where some days I couldn't get out of bed.</p>

<p>The main problem being that in my third year I was living with some really shitty people and they were really scathing of mental health issues, meaning I didn't seek the help I needed and am now getting and didn't apply for special circumstance. Hindsight really is 20:20.</p>

<p>I have taken time out of my career to get this sorted and to make sure that I am taking the right path for me. I have now ruled it down to three possible paths and want to apply to see what I can do. </p>

<p>I just want to know whether I should mention these issues and the steps I've taken in my time off to overcome these, on my personal statement. I don't seem to get anywhere else to put this and none of my previous lecturers know about this to mention on any references.</p>
",104269,21-02-2018 12:02,"How much detail about mental health issues should one include in ""Special Circumstances"" section of graduate school applications?","<p>This question is inspired by answers and comments to the question <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/31855/should-a-postdoc-talk-about-his-depression-with-his-mentor"">""Should a postdoc talk about his depression with his mentor?""</a> on this website.</p>

<p>Suppose that an applicant to a graduate program suffered from some mental health issues during the completion of his previous degrees, and that this situation had a noticeable impact on his academic performance (for example, significantly lower grades or part-time status for one or several semesters).</p>

<p>Most graduate school applications have sections dedicated to providing explanations for such special circumstances, and it is of course strongly recommended that any applicant with unusual drops in academic performance should mention something about this in the special circumstances section. Otherwise, the admission committee will be left to guess what might have happened, which is likely to decrease the odds of being admitted (indeed, it seems a consensus that the more tangible information an admission committee has about an applicant, the more confident they can be about the fact that admitting him will be a sound investment).</p>

<p>Many answers/comments to the question <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/31855/should-a-postdoc-talk-about-his-depression-with-his-mentor"">""Should a postdoc talk about his depression with his mentor?""</a> seem to recommend being very careful about revealing details on one's mental health conditions, given that there is still a lot of stigma attached to mental health conditions. However, in the case of PhD applications, not mentioning anything is <em>not</em> an option.</p>

<p>This then leads to the following question: If not making any mention of health issues is not an option (such as in PhD applications), how much details should one go into? To avoid stereotyping associated to any particular disease (such as depression=unreliable, learning disability=not smart) one could limit the description to ""health problem"", but could this lack of details be seen as suspicious and/or still a situation where the admissions committee will have to do guesswork?</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/14080/mention-impact-factor-or-conference-acceptance-rate-in-cv"">this question</a>, I came to wonder whether or not its acceptable to have self-assessed ratings of your technical skills, such as: proficiency programming languages, familiarity with relevant software etc. </p>

<p>My own feeling is that such ratings are useful to indicate what you feel most confident or comfortable with. It would also be useful to show any potential future employer the level of competence you have in different fields. If you think about it a bit, it is common to have some type of rating for the languages one speaks, so I think an analogue to programming language proficiency should not be that alienating.</p>

"In the US, is it culturally acceptable for a graduate student to give a small gift to a professor?","<p>I am an overseas student who was recently admitted to a PhD program in the US, and I will soon travel to the US to meet my future PhD advisor and my fellow grad students. My future PhD advisor has also kindly accepted to be my host for the duration of the several days I will spend in the US. I really appreciate his help, as I know hosting a student in addition to all the other responsibilities that come with being a professor may be a hassle, and also he has saved me from paying for a B&amp;B by offering to host me. </p>

<p>Anyway, I think I would like to give a small gift to my professor just as a token of appreciation for his consideration, but I have doubts as to whether this would be appropriate, since I come from a different culture, and I cannot easily assess how people would react to such a thing in the US. In my culture, too, it would be inappropriate to buy an expensive gift for a professor. In the best case, the professor would sternly refuse to accept the gift, and in the worst case, the professor could have negative ideas about you, e.g., s/he could think you were trying to ingratiate yourself with him/her, that you intended to give the gift as a form of bribe, etc. BUT a small gift with little to no monetary value wouldn't be turned down, and it would most probably be accepted as a token of heartfelt thankfulness. The question for me is, of course, where this boundary is in the US. </p>

<p>And in case you're wondering what I consider buying for him...well, my country happens to have nice tea sets and/or plates made of porcelain, they are popular souvenirs that tourists like to buy here, and one can easily buy a nice, small decorative plate for under 10 dollars, for instance.

Does it matter where I get PhD degree from if I want an academic career in the US?,"<p>I am an EU citizen who is going to apply to PhD Physics programs soon. My ultimate goal is to become a university professor. In considering which university I should attend for PhD, factors such as tuition &amp; program differences don't matter to me. What matters is that I don't feel like doing (nor do I agree with) the GRE (which would require a significant preparation), thus applying to PhD programs in the US might be out of the picture for me. However, the question pertains that if I want an academic career (ultimately, a professor position) in the US in the future, does it matter from which university I get my PhD degree? </p>

<p>Note: I do not care about a uni's rank or status. What I care about is whether the uni's location (different country) will affect where I can get jobs later on...</p>

<p>Thus I am asking:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>How are particle researchers assessed in reality,</strong> in the case when a Ph.D. applier is searching for and comparing professors in the similar field, or when a researcher is going to find a position as an assistant professor? Does the specific role of a scientist in the collaboration (say, the group leader) matter in this evaluation procedure?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How does university ranking play into this?</strong> What are the probable differences between professors in particle physics who work at a higher-ranked institution (ranked by physics major) and those who work at a lower-ranked one – given that they are both affiliated to some big collaboration.

"Low Undergrad GPA but 2 years Lab experience since graduating, How do I know where to apply?","<p>I've been working as a research assistant at a fairly reputable lab for about 1.5 years now (it will be two full years come November.) My field of study is Cognitive Neuroscience.</p>

<p>I plan on taking the GRE in November, and I'm confident I will score highly on it. </p>

<p>(Aiming for at least the 95th percentile.)</p>

<p>My undergrad GPA was quite low.</p>

<p>I completely bombed my first year and a half of undergrad, and ended up with a 1.33 GPA the second semester of my Sophomore year. </p>

<p>Suppose that an applicant to a graduate program suffered from some mental health issues during the completion of his previous degrees, and that this situation had a noticeable impact on his academic performance (for example, significantly lower grades or part-time status for one or several semesters).</p>

<p>Most graduate school applications have sections dedicated to providing explanations for such special circumstances, and it is of course strongly recommended that any applicant with unusual drops in academic performance should mention something about this in the special circumstances section. Otherwise, the admission committee will be left to guess what might have happened, which is likely to decrease the odds of being admitted (indeed, it seems a consensus that the more tangible information an admission committee has about an applicant, the more confident they can be about the fact that admitting him will be a sound investment).</p>

<p>Many answers/comments to the question <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/31855/should-a-postdoc-talk-about-his-depression-with-his-mentor"">""Should a postdoc talk about his depression with his mentor?""</a> seem to recommend being very careful about revealing details on one's mental health conditions, given that there is still a lot of stigma attached to mental health conditions. However, in the case of PhD applications, not mentioning anything is <em>not</em> an option.</p>

<p>This then leads to the following question: If not making any mention of health issues is not an option (such as in PhD applications), how much details should one go into? To avoid stereotyping associated to any particular disease (such as depression=unreliable, learning disability=not smart) one could limit the description to ""health problem"", but could this lack of details be seen as suspicious and/or still a situation where the admissions committee will have to do guesswork?</p>

How do I turn down postdoc offer for an industry job?,"<p>So I am in a bit of an unusual situation. I will be graduating this summer and I have been in touch with a professor for a couple of months about postdoc positions in his research group. He encouraged me to write proposals for fellowships to fund my postdoc stint with him. Since these fellowships were very competitive and I stood a low chance of getting them, he promised me a year of funding if none of the fellowships came through. Unfortunately, none of them came through. We talked about the situation last week and he suggested that I join his group and write grant proposals during the first year to fund my second year. Now that seems like a very bad idea to me because I am also supposed to publish papers and plan for what comes after my postdoc. It's also problematic because I am an international student in the USA and I would go out of legal visa status pretty fast if things go bad and I become unemployed after my first year. </p>

Under review since 9 months. Shall I send another email,"<p>First, I would like to mention that I saw that there are similar questions about this topic on this site but this one is very specific whose answer I could not find anywhere. The query is as follows.</p>

<p>I had sent a manuscript to a springer electrical Journal, 10 months back. For 3 months, the status showed ""With Editor"". Then finally it changed to ""Under Review"". For the past seven months, it is ""Under Review"". One month back, I had sent a polite enquiry to a person in editorial office about my paper. He replied that he was sorry and he has contacted senior editor to speed up the process. Today, exactly one month has passed since his reply and the status still remains under review. The average time taken for the first decision as mentioned on the official journal website is 3.5 months. My fear is that the article has already taken nearly a year since I had send it and if there is any more delay, I would not be in a position to send it to any other journal because the proposed approach will become old by then. Shall I send another email to the editorial staff, given that I had already sent another email just a month before? What kind of email can be sent in such a situation ?  </p>

I am 45 yrs. old and wanting to start my Ed.D. The program is estimated to be completed in 3yrs as I already have an MA and 18 additional graduate course work hours that some will likely transfer.

My goal is to take the Ed.D.  and my 26/27 yrs public education and move into a university setting and apply and pour into aspiring students who wish to become teachers as well as be a supervisor of student teachers.  I have thought of other ideas too like working more at a district level within a school district where my Ed.D. in Educational Leadership with the emphasis in curriculum and instruction or special education could be of value.

Meeting like-minded people for forming collaborative research relationships,"<p>I'm quite new at doing full-time research as a career.

Is there any (known) way to have Arxiv waive the endorsement requirement?,"<p>I’m trying to submit a preprint of my paper to the Arxiv as an independent researcher. My academic background is in theoretical physics; I have a PhD in physics, did a postdoc, published several papers in Physical Review and PRL before taking a job in industry.

I’ve spent the past few years working on my research project independently, and I’d like to submit to the Arxiv and have the community review my results.</p>

<p>I’m currently stuck at the “not endorsed” step. I’ve reached out to qualified endorsers in my subject per the Arxiv’s endorsement process but got no replies. I then contacted the moderation to appeal, but they rejected with what seems like a template reply (“We insist submitters be affiliated...”)</p>

How important are extracurricular activities as a Mathematics Major?,"<p>So I'm about halfway through my Sophomore year of college at LSU and on my way to a major in Mathematics with about a 4.05 GPA so far. My main objective is to be a desirable candidate for a good grad program. It doesn't really have to be a super top-tier school, but I wouldn't like to do a grad program in Mathematics at a school like LSU; I would like it to be a higher tier than that. I understand that my GPA and internships/work experience in my field are the two most important things for my major. So far, I haven't done any extracurriculars at all during the semester and worked at a summer camp the summer after my Freshman year. I plan on doing a math-related internship this summer. So, how important are extracurriculars during the semester? I find myself not having as much free time as I'd like when school is in session, so I held off on them. Is it important that I do something such as a community service group (which would be my main extracurricular interest) in order to make myself more desirable as a grad candidate? Thanks</p>

<p>In my entire life, I've never heard of undergraduates publishing results apart from a handful of examples from famous science prodigies.</p>

<p>Furthermore, my experience of undergraduate was not conducive <em>at all</em> to publishing. I graduated from a mediocre UK university, and there was no original research done at all. Undergraduate is for getting you up to speed on the foundations of a field, preparing you for postgraduate where you study one sub-field, then a PhD where you push the boundaries of a sub-sub-field.</p>

<p>The questions linked above give advice like, ""Discuss it with your supervisor"". But as far as I'm aware undergraduates don't have supervisors.</p>

If the paper is computer science, for instance, I may easily run additional experiments, or slightly change the setup and re-run the existing experiments. If I submit the paper with these results, I will basically be publishing experiments that have not, in their current form, been peer-reviewed.</p>

This was before I did my PhD (was a Master's student in a different field that I am currently in).</p>

<p>To explain, my role in the data collection and analysis was quite specific, and in the investigation it was deemed that my part of the work was verifiable and sound. In hindsight, I have long realised that I should have taken on a more active role in proof-reading the article as a whole, cross checking the findings and being more active in the article writing process. For that, I have always taken responsibility - so, even though I do not have anything to do with the lead author anymore - I am not blaming anyone.</p>

Understanding UK PhD requirements,"<p>I'm looking at a few ""fully"" funded PhD's in the UK. Now I understand it is a terrible timing with the whole Brexit travesty. But disregarding that, I'm failing to understand a few things and I hope you may be able to assist.</p>

<p>1) ""...first-class or strong upper second-class undergraduate degree with honours (or equivalent international qualifications), as a minimum, in science or mathematics..."" </p>

<p>What nightmarish system is this? I tried converting my Masters Degree in Science(2 years), which by the Danish system has an average at 10.93. Now according to a conversion guide I located, a 10 is 2:1 whilst an average of 12 is a first-class(Which is unrealistic to obtain by the way). 
Am I right to assume an undergraduate degree would be equivalent to my bachelors in science(3 years) and won't matter? So if I only look at my masters degree average, then what am I? First class graduate or 2:1 graduate? Who determines this when applying? What about honours? This doesn't exist in my country at all. I also found something about some information about early courses counting less, than harder courses later on - where as we count everything by the ECTS system. </p>

<p>2) When finding fully funded PhD positions, it often says that as a non-UK citizen, a fee is applicable. However, I cannot find anything specific detailing this. I find this concept slightly difficult to grasp, as any EU citizen that comes to my university here in Denmark, and is accepted into a fully funded PhD, will have no economic expenses and will be paid very VERY well every month. Generally regarded as an employee.</p>

<li><p>In UK 2:1 is earned if you have a 60-69% of the points. I've read that 2:1 is the same as 67%.</p></li>

<li><p>If you are Spanish and have 6.7, when converting it to GPA the result is 1.5.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>However, if you take the above points and treat them as a math equation, the final result will be GPA 1.5 = GPA 3.2, which doesn't make any sense.</p>

UK 2:1 = Spain 6.7
Spain 6.7 = GPA 1.5

In most other disciplines, at least within science and engineering, the ordering of authors is a signal about their relative contributions to the paper, with the first author indicating the most significant contributor.

<p><strong>What does first authorship actually mean in your discipline?</strong> I understand vaguely that the first author is supposed to be the one who ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_author"">did the most work</a>"", but what counts as ""work"" in this comparison?

Help me decide on a grad school,"<p>First post </p>

<p>Little about me (without being too specific). I’m in my final year of undergrad at a top U.K. school. I did a year abroad at a top 10 American school and loved it, so applied for PhDs in the states. I’ve got offers from decent (not great, and not my top choice) schools. However, I’ve got an offer from another top U.K. school (different from undergrad - heard it’s a little taboo to do undergrad and grad at the same institution). </p>

<p>I loved America and want to go back but I don’t want go for the sake of going and I don’t want to miss this opportunity in the UK. Plus I don’t know what I want to do after. </p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<p>How important is university prestige for grad school?</p>

<p>I believe it’s very possible to do a postdoc in America if I stay in the UK, is this true?</p>

<p>Also, what would you do? All institutions give full financial packages.</p>

2 degrees with average grades or 1 degree with excellent grades?,"<p><em>I asked this question before <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/126395/2-majors-with-average-grades-or-1-major-with-excellent-grades"">here</a> but asking about ""double major"". I have since been informed that a double major is not the correct translation for what I wanted to ask about, and that a double major does not add significantly more time to the workload, hence the premise is questionable. I hope ""two degrees"" is a better translation. Also, note that a ""double major"" as it is known in the US is not offered by the university (and also not what I would like to do). Since all of the answers to my original question considered a double major, I thought there was no sense in editing the question and thus opened a new one.</em></p>

<p>Since that might be relevant, I am asking this question as a german student. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it incentivised to pursuit two (related) degrees (eg. Math and
  Aero- Space Engineering) or a single degree (eg. Math)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question is asked with the premise that if one chose a single degree, one would have more time and thus achieve better grades (assume top 5 or 10 percentile), whereas with two degrees, one would only be able to achieve slightly above average grades, but have a broader scope and be better prepared for industry (at least that was my line of thought). Again, I am asking about obtaining two separate degrees, not a double major. According to the university, one degree is designed to consume about 40 hrs per week. Considering that the question is about somewhat related fields, I would estimate the hours per week to be at least 60 (as some lectures can count towards both degrees).</p>

<p>I guess that the answer is very different for someone who wants to go into academia, as opposed to someone who goes into private industry, so I would appreciate a split answer regarding the two cases.</p>

<p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>

My supervisor published our work without informing us. Can we retract the paper from the conference in anyway?,"<p>We (myself and my thesis partner) worked on a research problem in 2017 as part of our undergrad thesis course in our university under a supervisor. We successfully defended our thesis in our thesis defence in our university and prepared an IEEE-formatted paper as per the request of our supervisor as he told us that we would be publishing it in a flagship conference in the following year. I personally mailed the final version of the paper to our supervisor.</p>
<p>We followed up with him till July 2018 as the proposal had to be sent to that conference by July 2018. But our supervisor told us that he didn't want to publish it in that conference. He rather told us that we would publish it in a good journal in the immediate future. We tried to follow up with him on several occasions about that but he somehow skipped through the conversations.</p>
<p>At the start of this month, my partner was searching through some research work in IEEE where he saw a paper titled exactly to that of our thesis work. When he dug in, he found out that our supervisor published the paper in that same conference without our names. The conference was in October 2018 and the paper was published in IEEE Xplore in December 2018. We collected the paper and saw that it was the same paper with the same title that I emailed my supervisor (only a few words here and there have been changed, about 90-95% is the same).</p>
<p>He along with his name added his PhD supervisor (who is a dean of a renowned university in our country) and a Korean professor in that paper as authors. One similar case is <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/13700/my-advisor-submitted-a-paper-with-my-work-without-including-me-as-an-author"">here</a> in which the victim was yet to confront his supervisor directly and also told later he was acknowledged at the end of the journal. But in our case, we didn't get any acknowledgment. Also when we confronted our supervisor with the matter, he told us that he forgot to include our names which sounded more like preplanned. He also told us to not raise the issue further and offered us to help to publish the paper by extending it in a journal in the future.</p>
<p>We have talked to the department head about this. Although he was hurt by it, he hinted that the department won't be able to help much as there were two renowned and influential professors involved. Because our department gets benefited from them in several ways.</p>
<p>We have worked so hard for this work for nearly one and a half years as well as spent some huge money to buy some equipment for collecting the dataset. We're totally distraught and shocked by this incident. We would like to remove that paper from that conference somehow as we've worked so hard for this.</p>
<p>Is it possible though? If it is then what are the procedures of retracting the paper from that IEEE conference? Or should we just accept our supervisor's offer and move on from it?</p>
<p>For your kind information, I have the email proof of sending the paper to my supervisor as well as our thesis book with our name in it as an acknowledgement that it is our work which was signed by our supervisor, department head, and an external professor during our undergrad defence.</p>
",126485,14-03-2019 23:17,My advisor submitted a paper with my work without including me as an author,"<p>As you might see from my history I don't have a good relationship with my advisor. Recently we wrote a journal paper together based on my thesis. I wrote the introduction, analysis and the description of the app we had developed for our research. In crude terms, I wrote 15 pages of the 23 page journal paper. My advisor told me that our draft was submitted to this journal three weeks ago, yet I never received any notification from the journal that I was listed as author or co-author.</p>



<p>I went into the help section of the journal to figure if they do send emails to every author and it seems you do need an email to register as co-author. Confirmation <a href=""http://journalauthors.tandf.co.uk/pdfs/SubmitGuide_S1M_1.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>. </p>

<p>According to the guidelines, if the co-author is not registered with the journal, their email should be provided. Its quite obvious I should have received an confirmation email and my advisor only has my .edu email so there is no way another email address could have been used. I have written a journal paper to IEEE as co-author before and I had received an confirmatory email saying I was listed as co-author.  I am afraid of confronting my advisor about this as I need co-operation to graduate and in my thesis defense, but I was curious to know if I will get an email if I am listed as co-author? More importantly, should I be listed as author or co-author in this case, when the work is based on my thesis and I wrote most of the paper?</p>

<p>I called the 1-800 number and when I told them the submitter's last name (my advisor) and the paper title, they confirmed that my advisor was listed as sole author. They told me that they had to un-submit and resubmit the journal paper to add me as co-author and they gave me contact of a University professor for further inquiries. I have all the email proof of my work (for instance emails where my advisor asks me to write intro and I would reply with the intro text attached and so on). I am seriously upset right now. I have my thesis defense in December and I fear that if I confront my advisor, things will screw up. Can you  please advise on what I should do right now?</p>

<p>PS:  I was told that I am listed in Acknowledgement section in the end, which is completely unfair. The Deciding officer (it seems he is the final authority in these cases and RIO reports to him) at my University is the vice president, who was my advisor's PhD Advisor half a decade ago. They are both from same city of a foreign country and are close family friends. Rumor has it that the Vice President rejected multiple highly qualified candidates to get my advisor for Asst. Prof. Position.  All my friends are asking me to drop it because I don't have many bullets to go after them, but they can completely screw me up or set me up for something if I go against ""one of their own"". I am still evaluating what to do.</p>

<p>PPS: Thank you for all your advice. Even though I don't know any of you personally, you were very kind in giving me your time and advice. I cannot thank you all enough. I spoke with a full professor in another deptartment in Engineering. He asked me to stay put till December until the paper is published. He was of opinion that the University is a big cesspool and they only way to clean it is to ""get the people"" who are doing this publicly and shame them. I do not know if I am being used as pawn right now in University politics or what I should do. I  spoke with other people too and all they said was ""Is not getting an authorship on journal worth more than not earning the degree"". It seems sole authorship does carry extra weight age in front of tenure committee. The whole situation has completely shattered my faith in academics, and the fact that I am part of a state university makes this even more depressing. By the way, one of the two editors of this journal was on advisor's PhD committee. So many people have advised me not to contact any of them. In academia everybody seems to know everybody, in fact it seems more like a cult. I am just doing a Masters now, I always had plans to do PhD and explore my curiosities and see what I can achieve with perseverance, hard work and to test my mental capabilities to their limit, but I am done. I quit. I never felt so depressed for a very long time. Academia these days seems to run by industry practitioners who had previous experience at corporate politics and are good at it or by businessman who wear good clothes, have good people skills and just show off while delegating all the work to GRAs and underlings, and that's not what I am and will never be. </p>

Why shouldn't an unsolicited email asking for opinion include the links to the articles?,"<p>I have a precursory research – that is, an article posted in my website to know what I want to pursue – and want to send to a professor to have his opinion. However, <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/azt359/help_me_check_if_this_email_for_a_grad_student/eifmuhh/?st=jtbeyb6z&amp;sh=63c34977"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">I was advised</a> to ask him if he has time to read my ideas first before sending links to long blog posts. </p>

<p>I wonder why that is a case. I understand that this is to show that I respect his time – a professor has many duties – but I think in the end it depends on the interestingness of the content. If it is interesting enough, then no matter how long it is, it is still, well, interesting. And I think this factor is basically the relevance of my email to his work. As explained in <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/a/20766/14341"">this answer</a>, as long as the email is relevant it can be answered. </p>

<p>In my case, it has raised some interests to others in tangient fields, and matches one of his research interests, so I don't think there should be a problem. What may be a problem is that he may be reluctant to click on an unsolicited link, or the articles are long. But I suppose this is a normal thing that researchers do all the time? All of the problems here – sending unsolicited email to ask for opinion, putting the article in a link or attachment to keep the email short, putting the ideas in blog when they are just initial observations – don't seem to be problem to me. </p>

<p>Think of the email like this very question: I ask you unsolicitously, you may have a lot of duties, and there are three links on it. If I don't need to worry whether I am wasting your time reading this question, then why should I worry I'm wasting his time?  The email is much shorter than this question. I don't see why there should be extra cautious.</p>

My supervisor keeps telling me that I should have finished those tasks already a long time ago, including several suggestions and changes which were made during the development.<br>
Thus, I slowly started to doubt myself, and am not sure anymore if those tasks are more complex than expected, or if I'm just incompetent and unable to complete them at all. It doesn't help either that my supervisor has no knowledge about the field the tasks are located in (he's an experimentalist, the current tasks are involving both heavy computational tasks and experimental tasks with materials no one in the university has worked with before).<br>
Therefore, I was wondering if there is a way to determine if those tasks are just more complicated than expected, or if I'm just too slow for completion due to incompetence or lack of working hours?</p>

For me, this usually manifests in the thought: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>I've somehow convinced everyone into believing that I'm actually good at this.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>followed by the horrifying notion that eventually I'll be found out and my world will collapse. </p>

<p>I believe that the imposter syndrome is not uncommon in academia. I'm interested to know how other people here have experienced and dealt with it. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In particular, I'm looking for <strong>actual tactics</strong> that someone might
  use to combat imposter syndrome.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><em>Why I asked this question:</em></p>

<p>Beyond the obvious reason that this is something I have struggled with for many years and only recently gotten a handle on myself, there's also some evidence that merely realizing that other people experience imposter syndrome helps fellow imposters. As a grad student, I've managed to meet a fair number of people who are in their own struggles with imposter syndrome; however, the tactics and self-trickery that have helped me don't always speak to them and perhaps someone else's methods might. </p>

Advisor as an assistant professor a reputed private R2 school vs a full professor at a R1 school for PhD,"<p>I did my Master's from a top 5 school. Now I have to make a choice between these two professors. While the R2 school is a private school with a great track record of research in my field - there's an assistant professor there who's willing to hire me. He has a good network, is very driven - and so - I'll be publishing a lot. Plus, the R2 school works in close collaboration with industry - so, getting a job after the PhD will be much easier. </p>

<p>The R1 school professor is a stud though, and has amazing collabs. But, precisely because he's a stud, I don't think that he's very inclined towards having his students in industry (the whole if you're not in academia you're a failure culture). His students have good postdoc positions or work for research positions for the govt. </p>

<p>Going for R1 school will restrict industry possibilities - he is not very much into industry collaborations. But he has an established lab and an established network - so I'll probably go into academia - and hang out with people who do research for the love of it - with zero industry emphasis. I don't want to get stuck in academia - and want my life to move forward after industry. </p>

<p>Going for R2 school is kinda a gamble. The professor did win a prestigious grant and has full funding - and since he is new, he's more aware of recent trends, and not exactly in his own world (ain't nothing wrong in that). I am very well aware of that fact that I'll be working on the projects that he has grants for and won't necessarily be the guy that has a breakthrough during PhD because of the nature of those grants. But the R2 school is pretty renowned in my field in industry, and the school has a lot of industry collaborations. </p>

<p>I'm hella confused. I also have an offer from my master's school (top 5) but with only one year of TA and no RA currently. Also the research domain is new-ish, so not really excited about the top 5 school.</p>

"Considering a second PhD, this time in statistics. Will any professors be interested in working with me?","<p>I have a PhD in applied mathematics from a top university. I didn't realise it at the time because I was so focussed on my research, but it seems my research area (numerical analysis of PDEs) is actually very niche in terms of real-world problems in industry.</p>

<p>All the job listings I see are looking for people with a probability/statistics/machine learning background. There are literally hundreds of listings for these types of jobs for every one job in my area. I am currently a postdoc but I plan to leave academia for industry (probably finance) in the near future.</p>

<p>As the need for people with statistical skills is so clear, I have started considering the possibility of doing a second PhD, this time in a statistical area.</p>

<p>It would have to be part-time as I will be working full-time in industry. However, I currently work 7 days a week and very long hours on research as a postdoc, it is my hobby as much as my job. So when I begin working in industry, which is a standard 40 hour Mon-Fri working week, from my perspective I will have a huge amount of free time, i.e. eveninings and weekends, that I could dedicate to statistical research.</p>

<p>So I have several motivating factors for considering doing a second PhD:</p>

<ul>
<li>Statistical skills are very much in demand and are of far more use in real-world applications than my own niche skillset. I would like to work on important real-world problems and it would be ideal to have a qualification for this.</li>
<li>I absolutely love research and having a goal to work towards to motivate me to get really deep into a topic. I will have alot of free time when I move to industry soon, and I would like to dedicate that time to something constructive.</li>
<li>I am interested in probability and statistics from a theoretical perspective and I would like to make a contribution to this field. Originally I applied for PhDs in this area, along with applied math PhDs; I went with the math PhD as I was also very interested in that area and it was a great opportunity to work with an excellent supervisor and university.</li>
</ul>

<p>So a second PhD in a statistical area seems to make alot of sense to me.</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Would any professor even be interested in working with me considering
that I already a PhD and that I plan to work on the second PhD during evenings and weekends?</li>
<li>If you think there are professors that might be interested, how
should I go about approaching them? I would not like to appear
unprofessional.</li>
<li>I don't need any funding as I will be working full-time. Will this help me in finding a professor for a second PhD or is it largely irrelevant?</li>

Will a paper published in an unrelated/other sub-discipline matter for graduate admission?,"<p>My question is similar in spirit, though different in context (I think) to the question posted <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/82085/will-papers-published-in-other-sub-disciplines-matter-for-graduate-admission/82088"">here</a>.</p>

<p>My professor and I recently submitted a paper on arXiv (submitting for publication soon) that falls in the domain of quantum physics. Here's the <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.01609.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link</a>. I really liked enjoying working on the project, and I found it to be a valuable learning experience. </p>

<p>I, however, don't wish to apply to graduate school in physics and specialize in quantum mechanics -- and the study of open quantum systems etc. Ideally, I'd like to join a mathematical physics research group, working of such topics as quantum gravity etc. with a mathematical focus or working on the mathematical aspects of various sub disciplines (quantum mechanics, topological insulators etc.).</p>

<p>I'm aware that being able to demonstrated the ability to do research prior to the graduate level is highly valued at US universities. My question is how will the graduate admissions committee(s) view this (potential) paper? It's already hard to get a spot in various mathematical physics research programs. Will they consider this publication as having no value to them, since the paper doesn't directly coincide with their sub-discipline? Or (if I spin it right), is it possible/expected that they'll view this as an indication of the student's ability to work outside of classroom, work on a project etc.</p>

<p><strong>Edit -- How I intend to spin it.</strong> I'd like to use this paper to convince the graduate admissions committee follows: I come from a non-physics background ( major), and I have been studying physics/mathematics (in class, out of class etc.) for the last 2-3 years, and I wish to apply in 1-2 years. I started working on this paper after 1 year of studying physics in class. My first year was quantum mechanics (QM) heavy (three courses). The professor suggested the problem, which mostly used ideas from QM and some basic ideas from quantum information. I worked on the project with him and given my experience of having made the transition, making the first year of transition QM intensive and then working on a QM related problem and producing something with/with the help of a professor (regardless of its impact), I'm thinking of selling it as an indication that I can work outside of class, even when I (had to) make the transition; more importantly, given a problem related to the material I had covered after making the transition, I could produce something.</p>

<p>I know I'm more of ""selling it"" rather than ""linking it with my future research interests."" How does this sound in terms of having an impact on the committee and how they'll evaluate me (and my unusual situation).</p>

",85068,14-02-2017 16:28,Elsevier production team messed up my paper. What should I do?,"<p>I have a paper accepted by a journal of Elsevier, and it went under production for 3 months. Yet the production team has not been able to fix certain problems with typesetting which appeared during the proofreading. After the first month, I received the proofreading notification. The first production of my paper was really bad: a lot of errors in equations, symbols, figures and tables. So I prepared and submitted a lengthy list of request for correction, with as much information as possible. </p>

<p>A few days later, I received a strange email from the journal manager (who is said to be affiliated with Elsevier Global Journals Production), telling me that the production team has to ignore my request as it may cause them too much trouble. I gave a full explanation to this manager about how bad it is with the production and the request has to be processed. In the end, the manager agreed to make the corrections.</p>

<p>Two or three weeks later, my paper went directly online (early access), with all the typesetting problems unfixed, and even had some extra new problems. I was very worried because my paper DOI already took effect. I never heard of a paper which is already put online (for public download) can be fixed again. The journal manager apologized to me, saying that the production team was busy with other papers, but they will fix the problems and get back to me with another proofreading. Two months have passed, and I have yet to receive my second proofreading. </p>

<p>I fear the production team is just trying to avoid the proofreading by intentionally postponing, in an attempt to reach a point where it becomes officially impossible to make changes. As a matter of fact, my paper's official issue date is coming near, and the production team is probably already planning to have an early Christmas.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>NOTE 1:</strong> And NO, it is not about aesthetics.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE 2:</strong> I am not trying to be a PITA. Considering that I contributed a lot to Elsevier by being a frequent and responsible reviewer and yet received a very poor production of my paper, I am simply very disappointed. </p>

<p><strong>Concluding remarks</strong></p>

<p>I would like to thank all the people who have offered me valuable suggestion. As a matter of fact, after I posted this question here yesterday, I received a notification email, that I have been waiting for, for proofreading today. There are still many unsolved problems, but at least it is a good start. I would like to think my post somehow helped change the situation for the better.</p>

<p>My OP and comments might have caused some confusion and probably even dissatisfication as my posts usually do. It is probably because: I did not spend hours writing down every bit of details about the whole situation; I am not a native user of English language. But maybe most of all, because I was a little bit angry and that could be contageous. Therefore, my apologies. On the other hand, there is really no need for some of the repliers to call me a ranter. It is a hurtful language. I get that you are experts on this and many more forums and can't wait to show people your expertise. However,You really did not help and you have wasted your time. Please do yourself a favor and leave me alone.</p>

<p>About my attitude toward Elsevier, I'm not saying Elsevier this and that. It is probably one of the oldest publishers around, and probably the biggest contributer to dissemination of knowledge (its pricing policy being another matter). I am saying what it is: they messed up my paper and the first thing their production team did is to persuade me to give up trying to make corrections. I have worked with almost all the major publishers, and never have I encountered such a situation. To Elsevier from a contributor, you should hire more people for your production team, and I don't know, pay them more?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Lessons learned:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Don't expect the Elsevier production team to look into your TeX file, such as noticing the specified width/height of figures. You need to deliver a foolproof source package to them. In particular, Set BB size to actual figure size in the paper (ghostscript could do the job).</p></li>
<li><p>Elsevier production team doesn't like table cell shadings, not even non-cosmetic shadings (It should probably be put down in the instruction).</p></li>
<li><p>Elsevier team is not very good with math fonts. One should probably write an instruction of the symbols used in his/her paper.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>The manager got back to me again, much quicker this time, with an update. And they did the cell shading for me this time. Just so you know they didn't consider cell shading as ""definitely violating"" any standards. Not that I encourage people to use cell shading. </p>

<p><strong>Update in 2018</strong></p>

<p>I had the chance to work with the same journal again this year. I have to say the situation with the production team has improved dramatically! They respond much more quickly and the proofreading is much more professional (the software they use seem to have improved too). Many thanks to them (although I could not and probably should not name the journal) and Elsevier for the fine service they provide now.</p>

<p>This result is made possible, probably also because of the extensive measures I took to pre-process all figures, which I'd like to share here:</p>

<p>As most people know, transparency is usually flattened before the final production. However, hand in transparent figures directly to publishers will usually cause unforeseen results, due to the software incompatibility. My suggestion would be to manually reduce your figures to only two layers, one with all vector graphics, the other below it containing a rasterized version of all transparent objects (along with other raster contents). It is also suggested to simplify the vector graphics for smaller file size and faster onscreen generation. It might help to emphasize this to the production team too.</p>

<p>It occurs to me that figure sizing as in \includegraphics[width=...,height=]{figure} are sometimes unfortunately ignored in production. Therefore, it is suggested that one compiles all his or her figures separately, using \documentclass[multi=&lt; environment name for starting a new page >,preview]{standalone} so that the figures are properly resized before being inserted back into the paper using \includegraphics{figure}, i.e., without size specification. </p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>

"How does ""buying out"" of teaching work?","<p>Several times I have met young visiting faculty members who got ""bought out"" of teaching. This means that some senior professor opened their grant treasure chest and pays money so their younger co-worker needs to teach one course per semester less than usual. </p>

<p>How does that actually work? On the department side, they probably need manpower to offer courses to their students. Does somebody else do the job then (for the money) or what is the background with those buy-outs? Can people buy out themselves?

However, if a professor gets a research grant, he can support himself by the grant in the summer months, or teach fewer courses.</p>

<p>I'd like to know how it works exactly.

Having Trouble Finding a Faculty Member for Math Undergraduate Research,"<p>I am an undergraduate pursuing mathematics and computer science in the research university at U.S.  Inspired from the applications of algebra to math and statistics, I have been trying to find a suitable project in the mathematics with supervision from a faculty member, or a reading course in some topics of the pure mathematics.  I have been sending emails to professors at the math department for either a reading course or a project (regardless of the difficulty) I can pursue, but they are either not interested or ignoring my emails and corresponding followup reminders.  When I visited one of faculties during her office hour, she told me that she have been ignoring my emails since she is not interested in my proposal of research idea (I felt sad for a while as I hope she just informed me she is not available).  </p>

<p>The general outline is that I approach professors doing research similar to my interest, and ask them if they have any available project.  If they do not have projects, then I ask them if they are interested in hearing about my own ideas.</p>

<p>I am started to feel anxious about it as I really like to work with professors in the mathematics (my interests are not really in the domain of CS, but more or less the pure mathematics and its applications in theories of CS); I am interested in their research, but they are not interested. I understand the busy schedules of professors, so I am curious if there us any way to approach them to acquire the opportunities of project or reading course. So far, none of the professors at the department is interested or available...</p>
",85601,24-02-2017 22:37,How should I start Undergraduate Research in Mathematics?,"<p>Dear Academic SE advisers,</p>

<p>I am a college sophomore in US with double majors in mathematics and microbiology. My algorithmic biology research got me passionate about the number theory and analysis, and I have been pursuing a mathematics major starting on this Spring semester. I have been independently self-studying the number theory textbooks written by Niven/Zuckerman/Montgomery, Apostol, and Ireland/Rosen on this semester. As this semester progressed, I discovered that I am more interested in the pure mathematics than applied aspects (computational biology, cryptography, etc.). I want to pursue a career as analytic number theorist and prove the Collatz conjecture and Erdos-Straus conjecture. </p>

<p>I have been thinking about doing the number-theory research on my university (research university; huge mathematics department). I have been self-studying the NT by myself and also regularly attending the professional and graduate seminars on number theory but I did not do any pure mathematics research as an undergraduate. Should I visit NT professors in my university and ask them about if I can do undergraduate research under them? If research is not possible (perhaps due to my lacking maturity), should I request of doing independent reading under them and later proceed with the research? How should I ask them? What should I address? If even independent reading is not desirable to them, what should I ask to them or do in my own? </p>

<p>As for my mathematical background, I have been taking Calculus II (computational) and discrete mathematics. I will be taking calculus III (vector calc.) on Summer, followed by Analysis I, Probability, Theoretical Linear Algebra on Fall 2015. As for my self-studying on this semester, I have been studying NT textbooks (mentioned above), proof methodologies, and basic linear algebra. </p>

<p>Thank you very much for your time, and I look forward to your advice!</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>While this is the only place where I have found this rank explicitly, I have heard many other researchers refer to a conference as a ""A* conference"" or so.</p>

<p>So I am wondering: is this ranking official? Who is maintaining it? And on what is it based?</p>
",85712,27-02-2017 10:16,Is there any world-wide ranking of conferences/journals?,"<p>I know it's rather difficult to establish a ranking of publications, especially because the ones in charge of establishing values for venues might be biased by their field, and several other aspects. However, I know some well-accepted (at least locally) ranking, that consider all fields under research, e.g. <a href=""http://qualis.capes.gov.br/webqualis/"">Brazilian Qualis</a> - in portuguese - that includes both confs and journals, and <a href=""http://www.arc.gov.au/era/default.htm"">Australian ERA</a> - this latter has served as baseline for some class A conferences in Computer Science (my research field), in some countries other than Australia. </p>

<p>Hence, I wonder about the existence of another ""global ranking"", that has been applied overseas, thus including at least the most prominent events and journals in every field. For journals, it's a little bit easier to measure its importance, by looking at their Impact Factor values, but for conferences it's a little bit tough. To the best of my knowledge, I don't know a largely-applied means of measuring the impact of a conf.</p>

I am in my final semester of undergrad (have not applied to grad school yet) and now I am considering dropping this course. If I drop this course, I will not be able to graduate in June and will have to take a course in the summer. This also means that I will only have 3 courses on my transcript this semester (if I drop it). This is a philosophy course and thus there is no positive correlation between how hard one studies and their mark (professors have told my class this many times). I will need a B+ on my second essay.

</blockquote>

<p>Especially in light of the Internet in general, what is the added value of a lecture over a (hypertext)book?</p>

<p>Reasons I can think of:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>spoken word might stick better, because our language is not primarily based on text,</p></li>
<li><p>the possibility to ask for clarification,</p></li>
<li><p>some material might not translate well to media</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I dislike those arguments, because a huge class can neither run at a comfortable speed for all at once nor answer everyone's questions. The expectation seems to be that the students should be homogeneous and everyone nonconforming should be filtered out.</p>

<ol start=""4"">
<li>personal contact affects us on a deeper level, role models are important</li>
</ol>

<p>Depending on the class size, even that is doubtful.</p>

<ol start=""5"">
<li>to form communities,</li>
</ol>

<p>which would substitute or supplement the professors, but obviously at a different rate.</p>

<p>This is a trick question, because it depends on the style of the lecture.  In my experience the lecturer is acting as a medium and I'm watching them half the time writing on the board, or someone is asking obvious or distracting questions.  </p>

Sometimes the subject is so high-level or specialized or so modern that the contents are changing rapidly that there is no textbook (for example at the graduate level). But more often the textbook includes everything that will be said in the lecture, and much more: extra content, exercises, answers to exercises, appendices, etc. </p>

<p>I assume a STEM context, that is we can assume <em>the</em> textbook is available in the sense that there is one comprehensive source that contains undisputed facts, as opposed to a broad literature with lots of interpretations and opinions (as may be the case in non-STEM contexts).</p>

<p>So what is the point of a lecture?</p>

<p>Question: <strong>how to deal with curse words in content you need to quote?</strong></p>

<p>Since I use transcripts for a content (and not formal) analysis, I sometime 'smooth' interviewee wordings (like removing ""<em>hum</em>"", ""<em>well</em>"", ""<em>you know</em>"", and other recurring verbal tics). In some case, I <em>could</em> remove the f-word:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>it's just super f*cking slow, and really f *cking annoying</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, in some cases it is less harmless, because it more deeply changes the perceived meaning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if you don't want to do things, just don't f*cking do it</p>
  
  <p>oh f *ck, we'll just go back to do, as we were doing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and in some other, I simply cannot change interviewee's words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] he really tried and wanted to build up, but he completely f*cked up every single part of every single thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Since I am not a native speaker, I don't know how ""bad"" would using the f-word be perceived (which is why I tried to be careful here.)</p>

<p>In some cases, I could do a cut quote, e.g. ""<em>it's just super [...] slow, and really [...] annoying</em>"", but it looks like I'm not accurately depicting the wordings.</p>

<p>I've also seen on the internet people using 'f*ck' standing for the f-word. Could this be a solution? (I personally find this solution a bit prudish.)</p>

<p>Otherwise, could I simply quote them? Should I put a warning somewhere?</p>

",86386,12-03-2017 18:22,Good student but terrible test taker?,"<p>So I am gradute student in theoretical computer science. </p>

<p>Throughout my education path up to highschool, I have all been praised a big lot by my teachers, some of them even went to such lengths as to say I was the most intelligent student they have ever taught. By dint of all that, I took it for granted that I must be cleverer than average and before I noticed, I might have gotten on a very high horse.</p>

<p>Then I got into college, and things started getting harder. The higher the horse, the bigger and harder the fall. So my grades stopped being close to full score, but not bad at all. Until I decided that I wanted to do a PhD later, and for that, I have to get very good marks and hope to get a scholarship.</p>

<p>Ever since, at the dawn of every test/exam, as opposed to the relaxed and cool mindset I'd be in before, I get very, very, VERY anxious and very flustered, either out of fear that I run out of time (because of a lived experience), or of not having the answer. That anxiousness would get lifted immeditely when time is up, and on my way back home, all answers or most of them, would start flowing in my head.</p>

<p>Only this morning, I had a test which I failed like never before. I quickly glossed over problems one by one in order, my mind would go blank for a few seconds, then I would deciddeto move on to the next problem and that it is no use wasting time on this one (because I wasn""'t going to find a solution), and that for every exercise. It is for a reason I say I failed today's like never before because I literally could do nothing; my mind was paralyzed and started weating and how I was going to not get to what I want to (PhD). But as soon as I got home and sat down for a few minutes, I solved prefectly 5 problems out 7  in 30 minutes (the test was to do within 90 minutes).</p>

<p>I was one of the most confident people in themselves before, but now I lost every bit of that confidence and wouldn't stop thinking I'm too dumb to make it. I have been struggling with this for two years now, and after today's huge blow, I decided to take to the internet and this board in order to try and find a solution. Chances are Academia is not the right board to ask this question in, but it must be the closest to that out of all other SE boards.</p>

Is a corrigendum necessary if a published result is discovered to duplicate an earlier one?,"<p>(cross-posted from math.stackexchange.com)</p>

<p>I found after publication of an article that a chunk of it was duplicated in a previous article written by someone else, and I'd like to know if I should take some action, like write a corrigendum just to add the other paper as another citation.  Perhaps some journals have a formal process to deal with this?</p>

<p>In my field, pure mathematics, it sometimes happens that people publish the exact same theorem, but the methods are distinct enough that the reviewer of the later paper views it as publishable because of its methods.  In my case, only one of four theorems in my paper duplicates earlier work, but the methods I use, while looking slightly different, would certainly be considered essentially the same as the earlier paper.</p>

<p>I suppose the best answer might simply be, ""contact your journal and ask"".  On the other hand, I have seen many times a result claimed as ""independently"" discovered in multiple papers, and I don't recall seeing a corrigendum or something in those cases.  Perhaps a notation on the research page of my website is sufficient?  </p>

<p>As a follow-up, in mathematical publishing/culture, where is the line drawn between saying a result was ""independently"" discovered by multiple people and crediting all of them, as opposed to give priority to the one who was first?  Crediting all authors who gave substantially different proofs makes sense to me.  But what if two proofs use essentially the same idea?</p>

"Low undergraduate GPA. Strong research profile. Any chances of getting into the likes of MIT, Caltech, etc?","<p>I am a final year undergraduate student of Mechanical Engineering from Nepal. I plan to do master's in aerospace engineering (propulsion systems, to be specific) at a prestigious university in the US. With virtually zero scope for aerospace engineering research in our country and little to no guidance from experts, I have been involved in many research projects for years and have already got a number of papers published so far. I hope to add at least three more conference papers to my profile before I apply to any graduate school.
But the problem is that I am going to have a very low CGPA, anywhere between 2.4 - 2.7. I have heard that many schools don't bother to look at anything else in an application when they see a low GPA and reject it straightaway. Does that mean I have no chances at all? I have been working very hard to offset my low GPA and make my resume look better than those of most other applicants. 
MIT, for example, recommends a minimum of 3.2 as a guideline. What does that mean for me?

<p>I had therefore emailed three professors, two from another departent (CSE), and one adjunct from mine (EE). One of the CSE professors agreed, the EE professor agreed but told me he couldn't be chair because he was adjunct. I therefore got another EE professor to be chair. Now I will have to email the other CSE professor to tell him I don't need him to be on the committee anymore since I've got people already. This wouldn't have happened had I known about the rule for chair. </p>

For the fifth member, I approached Mr.A. He has no real connection to my research or topic but I contacted him because he was just as good a fit as anybody else in the department to be the fifth member. I have never worked with him or taken any classes but we did talk a lot in the first few years where he would just ask about my progress by the copy machine, etc. We don't even have a ""rapport"". The relationship is absolutely neutral, nothing positive/friendly, and nothing negative. I asked him to be on my committee and he said yes. I said I'll get back to you with dates, etc. He is a senior tenured professor.</p>

<p>Then about a month later, I was looking at the CV of some of the new hired (junior) faculty in the department Mr.B (this is his first year) and I see that we have a collaborator in common. Mr.B has published multiple papers with him and Mr.B is working with the same code and the code managing team that we are working with. He is definitely a good person to have on my committee. I finally see Mr.B after a few more months (because of busy schedule/travel/etc.) and he agrees to be on my committee.</p>

<p>The question is, how can I tell Mr.A, as tactfully as possible, after about four months of being quiet that he is basically rejected from my committee because I didn't know about Mr.B but now that I know, Mr.B is a much better match than he is? That I don't need him but I do appreciate his offer? I don't want to antagonize Mr.A or burn any bridges. Should this be in email or in person? Should I explain or just keep it terse? Should I keep it vague that I don't need him and thanks for his time? Or should I tell him about Mr.B and why he is a better match?</p>

<p>FYI, this was before anything official/paperwork was done so there is no problem with that.</p>

How to assess an unknown journal's quality?,"<p>[I apologize if it has been asked, I think it must have been but I couldn't find a similar question.]</p>

<p>I often receive invitations / calls for papers to write papers in journals. 95% of these cases are obvious spam publications, but in about 5% I see a letter that's not entirely generic, e.g. they mention my previous publications in the subject** and they write something that appears genuine about the publication. They also write the name of the editor in chief. </p>

<p>My question is how to assess this new journal's quality? I mean, nice journal pop up once in a while and just because it's a new journal, does not mean it's necessarily ""fake news"". </p>

<p>Here are a few points I thought about:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wait a few months/years until I see reputable people publish in it, but then I will have missed my shot, possibly.</li>
<li>Inspect the editor's reputation. If she/he appears reputable (e.g. have published in journals I know to be good), then the journal is okay.</li>
<li>Inspect the publisher's ""parents"", for example if it's ACM, Springer, IEEE, etc., then maybe it's worthwhile (but then, I can't say definitively either way).</li>

"If I accepted an admission and funding offer before April 15th, is it considered unethical to rescind if before April 15th","<p>Recently I applied to a number of graduate program in the humanities. After applying to ten schools, I received an offer in late February for a full funding package, from one of the universities, which seemed rather early to me. This offer came from an advisor, not the actual graduate school -  the official letter of acceptance from the graduate school came several weeks later. In the offer, the advisor stated that though I had been offered funding, they would appreciate an answer on whether I would accept the funding as soon as possible. Since this was late February, and I had only heard back from one school at the time, this put me in tricky situation, and I couldn't really give her a deliberate answer. I would certainly accept the funding if I chose to attend, but that was not a certainty by any means. The school from which I received the offer was not my top choice, a good school, but not a top choice. As such, I told her I needed more time, without going into any details. Quite simply though, I just hadn't heard back from most of my schools. </p>

<p>A couple of weeks later I heard back from this same advisor, and this time she again asked for an answer as soon as possible, but did notify me that the national deadline in which a decision can be made is April  15th, several weeks away. At this time, I was still waiting to receive a decision from a couple of other schools. I told her (the advisor that contacted me) that I needed more time.  One to two weeks went by, and trying to expedite the decision, I contacted the one last school that I hadn't heard from, and found out I had been placed on the waiting list. My waitlisted school said they needed to receive word from a couple of other students whom they had made offers to, and they could then possibly make an offer to me if these students declined. As such, after thinking myself into a rabbit hole with these complications, rashly, despite having thought of it for several weeks (which may be why I thought myself into a rabbit hole) I accepted the offer from the initial school that made the offer. </p>

<p>I have read elsewhere on these boards that accepting an offer and then withdrawing it after April 15th, for a waitlisted school is highly unethical and can cause dismissal from all schools. I certainly see the reasoning behind that, but if I were to rescind my acceptance before April 15th, hopefully a week or more, would this be considered unethical since they could still easily give the funding elsewhere? Moroever, would it be a disadvantage to the school I did receive the offer from? Finally, could it possibly have an effect on my long-term career if I rescinded the offer and accepted admission to the waitlisted school?   </p>

<p>Regardless, is it ethical to rescind an acceptance of funding and admission before April 15th (hopefully a week or more before)? Would this burn a serious bridge that would hurt my career? Would another student not receive funding since I accepted the offer and then withdrew it?  I understand that some programs will reach out to their highly-regarded candidates in order to recruit them, and I'm certainly not against the school, but it sounds like I have a solid chance of getting off of the waitlist. It was one of my top schools, for not just academic reasons but personal as well. Seeing how this is the next five years of my life, it's a weighty decision to make. Please let me know what you think, or if you have any official procedures for going about these matters. Thanks!</p>

I have told the project supervisor I accept it. In the meanwhile I have managed to secure a PhD offer from another 2 universities much better in world rankings and with better research groups and better faculty. Additionally these 2 universities do research exactly on what I want to devote my PhD research.</p>

<p>My only commitment to the first university is a mail confirming I accept. Nothing else. I understand declining the offer after already having accepted it is quite dishonest but it is a huge decision that will affect my future in a very significant level. </p>

<p>I would like your opinion and I would also like to ask for possible consequences of such an action. As far a postdocs concerned, in the first university there is no chance I ever get a postdoc since they do not actually do research on my area (except for the prospective supervisor and even he not as much).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
I have decided to do as I was afraid to. I have decided to choose a different university than the first one that I have already accepted the offer. My offer acceptance included: </p>

<ul>
<li>An online ""I accept"" statement.</li>
<li>An e-mail I sent stating ""I accept the scholarship and this University is my first option""</li>
</ul>

Can I use this as a part of a sensical excuse?</p>

<p><strong>WHAT I HAVE CHOSEN AND WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES WERE</strong></p>

<p>I think that I should let people, especially other beginning grad students know what happened with my case. I have chosen to nicely tell the first university I got accepted that I will not be attending and will not be pursuing a PhD there since I decided I have different research interests (which is true). I had applied there in the first place since I was not sure what I wanted to do and because it was a nice program. Despite that, I got an offer from a World top university to work on 100% my research interests. I explained this to them, the first uni, and they happily let me go and wished me good luck, especially the supervisor who faught a lot secure me funding. I was lucky.</p>

",87655,05-04-2017 20:19,How can editors and reviewers detect data manipulation?,"<p>I am preparing a paper in the field of Computer Science.</p>

<p>In order to report test results, we usually run a number of tests and report the average of those tests.</p>

<p>For each test, we generate random data.</p>

<p>Because of the randomness, at some points, the results may come out not as expected.</p>

<p>For instance, a graph may be like:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sxlcG.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Usually, one should explain why on points 8, 11 and 12 there is a decrease on the plot.
Probably, it is because of that randomness.</p>

<p>Not hand-crafting all the graph, but just manipulating a few points makes the graph acceptable:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/U2KuJ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Since three weeks or so, I work my ass off and try to figure out why my resulting graph looks like the first one. Sometimes I feel like yielding to temptation and just modify the raw data before I go crazy.</p>

<p>I believe, at this point the title became misleading, so let me make it clear:</p>

<p>I am not seeking an advice on data manipulation. I will not manipulate my data. However, I ask to myself ""how the hell this can be detected?""</p>

<p>And now, I don't only ask to myself, but to whole community. How is this detected? For editors, referees out there, have you ever detected something like this?</p>

Lack of motivation-Changing PhD,"<p>I know there are different posts about changing PhD, but with such an important decision I would like to ask the same question but including the details of my personal situation.</p>

<p>I am in the first year of my PhD (now starting the 8th month). I did my masters in my home country, Spain, where I did research in computational protein dynamics although my background is about computational chemistry at atomistic level (Quantum Mechanics). I really enjoyed my masters, but I decided to look for a PhD position in quantum chemistry again. I got this position in Stockholm University. I though I would enjoy it, but after 7 months I am not enjoying at all, I do not trust my own research and my interests are moving far from this field. The thing that my group is the only computational group of the whole department is also a big point, because all other groups are experimental and this make me feel quite isolated.</p>

<p>I already had a talk with my boss, where I expressed all my concerns and where we agreed to look for new things. He was really open-minded and comprehensive, and I will try my best for the next months to see if the change fits me. However, my apathy feeling is still present and I think I should start considering the possibility of changing PhD. Do you think I must change only considering this personal feelings? In the past I was really passionate in science, but this feeling of apathy is keeling me. I want to make clear that there is not any problem with my boss or my group mates (all of them are really fantastic), just with myself and my motivation.</p>

<p>Any opinion and advise is welcome</p>
",87681,06-04-2017 11:55,How should I deal with becoming discouraged as a graduate student?,"<p>I am a third year (starting fourth year in the fall) PhD student in mathematics. I've passed all qualifying exams and am currently doing research. As far as I can tell, I am not doing poorly. I have the good fortune of having a great advisor, being in a very supportive department, and having friends and family who genuinely care about my success. </p>

<p>The fact is research is hard. It appears to consist primarily of staring at a problem for days and days and days without getting anywhere. Sometimes, rarely, I do figure something out and that feels wonderful, but the overwhelming majority of my time appears to be spent banging my head against a mostly figurative wall. I am not complaining about the material being hard, and I am not averse to putting in hard work, but I get frequently discouraged when I realize the vast volumes of mathematics that I yet know nothing about (and probably never will). It's very hard to quantify progress - in particular, there are too few tangible returns after too many hours worked. I find myself thinking along the lines of ""Oh, if only someone actually smart were thinking about this problem they would have solved it in moments"" and so on. </p>

<p>I've talked about this to some number of people; here is some advice I have received:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take a day off. Putting in hours upon hours of trying things doesn't magically lead to a solution, particularly if the brain is tired and just wants to sleep.</li>
<li>Have a hobby. Since math research doesn't exactly provide instant gratification, a hobby might provide some instead. </li>
<li>Talk to other graduate students. Realize that many graduate students go through this.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm interested to know how other folks have dealt with being discouraged as a graduate student. Does it get better with time and experience? Is this a sign that research is not for me and that I should seriously consider a life outside academia?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How do you tend to come up with initial/seed ideas? What is your search method (if you have one)?</p></li>
<li><p>What proportion of your ideas for past papers come from; (i) colleagues, (ii) intentionally browsing the literature for ideas, (iii) on the spot inspiration, (iv) conferences, (v) other?</p></li>

<li><p>Is there any special, generalizable method that you've discovered to sift out those ideas that are likely to be unrealistic early on in the process of idea generation?</p></li>

<p>One benefit of publishing on arXiv is that it helps to establish that I'm the earliest inventor of something. But I suspect this is a double-edged sword. What happens if I post something to arXiv, somebody else builds on the work and adds more material and publishes it in a journal (perhaps citing my pre-print) before I have a chance of publishing my article in a journal? Does a typical journal accept papers that were novel when posted to arXiv but are not novel anymore? Let's assume that I have an intention of publishing the papers in a journal within a couple of years at most, not within a decade or two.</p>

<p>Another benefit of publishing in arXiv I can see is that many publishers allow one to update previously published material on arXiv with the accepted author manuscript immediately, but do not allow uploading the accepted author manuscript to arXiv if not published prior to submission to a journal within an embargo period. So, by uploading the material to arXiv early I could effectively remove the embargo period.</p>

<p>One potential drawback of pre-publication in arXiv is that theoretically some journals or conferences could consider the material non-novel which could eliminate the chances of publishing in such a journal or a conference. Are there any noteworthy journals that have a policy of not permitting material that has a preprint on arXiv?</p>

<p>I can see the following options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Submit preprints to arXiv as early as possible, i.e. when the work is so complete that it might be interesting to others; when accepted, update with the accepted author manuscript.</li>
<li>Submit preprints to arXiv a couple of weeks or a month before submitting the paper to a journal or a conference; when accepted, update with the accepted author manuscript. This would eliminate the risk of somebody building a better work on top of my work and quickly publishing it.</li>
<li>Submit preprint to arXiv after publication in a journal. This might in some cases mean I have to wait for an embargo period of a year or so.</li>

My paper was retracted – how can I handle this in my future career?,"<p>In September 2016 I saw a PhD advertisement in a forum. I emailed the advertiser and he sent me a half-baked draft of a research project and told me that if I want this position I would need a first-author publication and therefore I should make that draft publishable. I did that and sent the draft back to him.</p>

<p>After some time I asked him about the paper and he told he has submitted that and we will hear from the journal soon, but he did not give me any confirmation email from any journal. After few months he asked me to do the same analysis on another topic but this time from the scratch.</p>

<p>I started research on that topic when I was waiting for the journal he mentioned to inform us. One night, in Skype he asked me to send him some of my personal pictures. First I thought he might just be curious but he started a nasty conversation about my marital status etc. I felt that something was going wrong and I told him that I don’t want to carry on that that collaboration. I stopped research on the second topic and ask him about the status of the submitted paper. He replied that he didn’t want to publish that with me anymore.</p>

<p>I was just shocked by his reaction and got too upset feeling being badly abused. I then submitted the draft to a journal in 2017 without mentioning his name, but he asked for retraction.
I sent all of conversation via Skype and Teamviewer to the editor and him. The editor told me I should disclose this with his university, but that the journal could not help and has to retract the paper.
The paper has been fully retracted in November 2019.
The retraction note of the journal says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This paper is significantly overlapped and based on an unpublished research by ...
  The author disagrees with this retraction</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this retraction note imply that I committed some academic misconduct? How can I handle it in future academic applications.</p>
",145669,21-03-2020 09:58,Editor rejected manuscript claiming it is similar to a not-yet-published manuscript (that I haven't seen). How to proceed?,"<p>A few months ago, I submitted a manuscript. After the reviews were completed I received a rejection decision from the Associate Editor (AE). The rejection was based on the basis of a single rejection recommendation by one of the four reviewers. The journal has very high standards so this is not uncommon. However, the reason for the rejection appears really awkward to me. The reviewer wrote in his/her report that another paper with a similar idea was submitted (not published) in another journal. He/she wrote that the submission date of the other paper was earlier than mine so the originality of my idea is questionable. The AE agreed with this report and adopted this argument in the rejection letter.  </p>

<p>I want to emphasize that my results were independently developed and I have no knowledge whatsoever of the other manuscript which according to the reports that were attached has not been published yet. The whole situation seems rather awkward and I am not sure how to react. Of course the reviewer's identity is not known to me, but I find it hard to believe that he/she is not an author or somehow related to the author of the other paper. </p>

<p>Furthermore, I feel really offended by these comments  as it appears to me that I am implicitly being accused of plagiarism. I am considering writing a letter to the Editor in Chief. I do not want to change the decision, but I would like to make clear that my results were independently obtained. Also, what are your thoughts on how should I proceed with my manuscript?     </p>

"Error in master's thesis, I do not know what to do","<p>I successfully defended my master's thesis last December.
 I had 18/20 and it went well. However, my adviser invited me to carry out research in the area, which I accepted. </p>

<p>When I was writing the first paper, I noticed a big error in the data analysis. This does not affect the conclusions and the values of the estimates are very similar (with and without the error) the question is what do I do now? I'm afraid to tell my advisor and they cancel my master's degree. What do you think? My ethics does not allow me to write the paper again with the error, but if correct my advisor will find .. </p>

I can say that in that time I was a ""child"" , very inexperienced. I think that also my advisor did not help a lot, and I tried to do  a lot of things by my own, without someone to really review my things. Despite that, I still received a good mention by the master committee on final results. </p>

<p>Some days ago, I just decided to read part of master thesis, and I just realized a big nightmare coming. I identified a lot of typos, some references errors, and some improvements that I should do, but I did not. The worst thing is that I wrote a paper to a conference with my master thesis results (and some errors are there). The conference is not a high impact conference, but still the paper has my name and is available for everyone... </p>

<p>As I am finishing my PhD studies for now, I am concerning a lot that situation. My dream and goal is to pursue a Professor career. So, my questions are: What are (or could be) the consequences of a master thesis and paper with errors (some minor and some major) in academia? Revoke degree after years by errors in master is possible ( I am concerning a lot this situation that I thought on it)? How can I minimize it (I thought that I can put a fixed version of my thesis and paper in the future, for instance on my personal website)? How those errors can impact me in a Professor recruitment process?</p>

<p>Sorry for the long text, I am blaming myself all the time, and really afraid about the possibilities since I know that Academia career is really competitive. </p>

COVID-19 Pass/Fail Option,"<p>I am currently an undergraduate student, and looking to apply to grad schools in the future. In response to COVID-19, my school is offering the ability between choosing the letter grade earned to appear on the transcript, or a pass if you earned over a C, for each individual class. </p>

<p>I'm wondering if choosing the pass option for one of my classes would reflect poorly on grad school applications. The class in question is a not a major or graduation requirement, and it is 4 credits, so taking a B or lower would hurt my GPA. </p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
",147130,01-04-2020 19:33,Should I be worried about low undergraduate grades during the COVID-19 crisis affecting grad school admission chances?,"<p>I'm currently in my undergraduate junior year studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Waterloo in Canada. I'm hoping to apply for Top 10 US grad schools in mechanical engineering in about 18 months. In response to the worldwide COVID-19 health crisis, our institution has (as have most academic institutions) switched to online teaching and made many changes to the structure of our courses to accommodate the situation.</p>

<p>As part of these changes, the university has offered students the option to selectively change the grade reporting on their transcripts to CR/NCR (Credit/No Credit) at the end of this semester. Normally, my grades would be pretty good (hovering around ~3.9 GPA) and I wouldn't bother to report my grades as a CR instead of as a percentage, but this crisis has completely disoriented me and made it difficult to focus on my studies.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the university has allowed instructors to retroactively adjust the course breakdown/weighting away from the original syllabus--this means that tests/projects that were originally worth 15% of the grade might have been increased to upwards of 40% weighting. This has had a negative impact on my course grades as well, as I was hoping to make up for poor showings on some of these lower-weight deliverables with strong final exam performances. Instead, these final exams are going to be worth much less now.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of these changes, I'm contemplating using the CR/NCR option on some of my course grades, particular with any grade that ends up lower than my current GPA. However, I'm worried about how this will be interpreted in my grad school admissions in a couple years. In normal circumstances, I think changing a percentage grade into a CR/Pass grade would be a red flag that a student's performance in the class was less-than-stellar.</p>

<p>Given the COVID-19 crisis and its effects on academia as a whole, are admissions committees two years down the road likely to be understanding if I decide to take advantage of the CR option now? Should I make use of it and explain that this was ""the coronavirus semester"" in my application package, or am I dooming myself by converting my grades from percentage into CRs?</p>

For the masters I have found this growing researcher who is doing amazing work and is eager for me to join his lab from the start of the program. Assuming that by the end of the MS, I get ~3.7GPA, a couple co-authored pub and 1 first authored pub in reputed journals along with going to conferences to present my work, altogether getting strong recommendations from the advisor and his colleagues. Will this in any way offset my u-GPA. Also apart from research in masters I have had about 2 years of research experience during undergrad (in and out of school) and have published a paper in a peer-reviewed journal. </p>

<p>I am looking to get into the biomedical engineering PhD programs at university of chicago, northwestern university, university of pittsburgh, john hopkins university, york university, and university of pennsylvania. Do you think that I am aiming too high? If so, what else should I look to do to improve my chances? Also if I start MS this Fall should I apply for PhD at Fall 2022 or Fall 2023?</p>

<p>Additional Info:</p>

<ul>
<li>I did a decent undergrad thesis (not great, 8 months), soon after I did a 2 month internship a another research lab. During my undergrad I worked w/ a prof for 1.2 years (Got two papers out - one in a conf and another in a journal). Currently I am working in a top research lab, now remotely due to covid-19 outbreak.</li>
<li>Some people have mentioned other questions thinking that those had the same information that I wanted. But, they did not as the questions talked about how to get into ""a/some"" PhD Program after a low U-GPA and maybe decent masters. The schools that I have mentioned above are ranked pretty high and  would appreciate if you could tailor your answers to my specific question of getting into these schools.</li>
<li>I picked these school not to show of the ""rank"" or ""prestige"" which seems stupid honestly. I chose the because of the strength in the field (F1) that I'm looking to do research in. In one of my previous questions I had mentioned that I got a PhD offer from university of houston which does the research in F1 but it isn't very strong in other area such as: number of grants that they pull in to do amazing research on large patient populations, intellectual cohorts, and industrial connections and startup resources. I picked these schools as I believe them to be the best in F1 and <strong>NOT for the main purpose of prestige</strong>. So if you don't have anything to suggest I <strong>IMPLORE</strong> you to not ask me to look at other schools as I did not ask for <strong>alternatives but solutions or ideas</strong></li>

Can lewd pictures and videos that non-consensually ended up on porn sites hurt my career in academia/industry?,"<p>I was involved in some not-safe-for-work (NSFW) photoshoots and amateur videos with a photographer in my undergrad (in the US) when I was going through a rough time. The media include my face in them (yes, stupid decision), and since I signed a model release he owns the pictures and videos. </p>

<p>He then set up a Tumblr account and posted the pictures and videos there (which I knew of and didn't mind at the time). However I recently realized that people had been stealing them and posting them on porn sites, and they've been up there for around 3-4 years now. There's no identifying information in them other than my face, so you wouldn't be able to just find them if you searched my name; you have to put in somewhat obscure terms or just happen to come across them to find them, really. Nevertheless I was shocked to see myself there. I'm trying to take them down but the videos are just on so many random porn sites that it'll be impossible to remove all of them. On top of that I don't technically own the media so there's that. </p>

I think my TA winked at me and have developed feelings. Should I ask her out after the semester ends?,"<p>TLDR: I have feelings for my TA, think she winked at me, and would like to ask her out after the end of the semester.</p>

<p>So my eyes do this weird thing sometimes when I'm sleep-deprived or stressed where it can look to an observer as if I might be winking. This can sometimes lead to problems for me for obvious reasons. However, a few weeks ago in class on a day when my eyes were particularly acting up I believe I might have received a first-- an unexpected return wink. My TA, turning around from the chalkboard momentarily, smiled and gave a very clear wink towards the direction of the room where I was sitting. I had been looking her way over the course of the class since she's the instructor, so it seems quite possible to me that she thought I was winking at her.</p>

<p>However, this was the final day of class before we transitioned to Zoom lectures due to coronavirus, and it's been really difficult to explore my suspicion that she's interested in me through online communication alone. I feel like the odds are low that she was winking at someone else. There were only about 15-20 students in the room, around 40-50% of whom are men. The seating arrangement meant that only about 5-7 people were seated in the direction of the room I was seated in. I wasn't really sure what to make of this when it first happened, but in recent weeks I've noticed myself developing feelings. When I contacted her with a question about an assignment, she responded by inviting me to toss some ideas around over zoom ""for fun."" I did a few days later, and she also made a point of asking me how I'd been doing with all that's going on and whether I'd be staying in town over the summer. I notice her tone of voice changing a bit when she talks to me, as well.</p>

<p>I really do enjoy talking to her and feel like I would genuinely like to get to know more about her academic passions and interests. As a 24-year-old re-entry student, I feel that the age gap isn't all that intense. In fact, I think I would probably have more in common with her than I would with most undergraduates. The area her work is focused in is also one of my intended majors.</p>

<p>With only two more weeks of instruction, I feel pressured to act before she loses interest. I was having trouble falling asleep most of the night last night due to my mind being so preoccupied with this, so I don't think I could feel alright with doing nothing and letting this pass. My plan was to continue to ask the occasional question during and after class and maybe schedule an office hours appointment for an assignment I genuinely have questions about, wait until the semester is over, and email her 1-2 weeks into the summer asking if she might be interested in getting coffee once social distancing restrictions begin to lift. Does this sound like a reasonable idea, or could it be that all the quarantine and social isolation is just getting to my head?</p>
",147836,18-04-2020 03:19,Is it ethical to tell my teaching assistant that I like him?,"<p>I, a twenty-year-old female, have come to admire the graduate teaching assistant for my summer course quite strongly. I'm extremely interested in what he has to say, I always pay attention, never use my phone and use eye contact to show interest. I do like them very much and I think about them with warmth often. I want to know about their work, I want to know what he is interested in. I would like to at least be their friend. </p>

<p>Despite my strong admiration I must emphasize that I have not and do not plan to cross professional boundaries until the end of the course. </p>

<p>I have spoken to them though it was only a short conversation about the work that was assigned to us the following weekend, however he did seem quite warm and open to conversation. Specifically he emphasizes in his syllabus to not hesitate to contact him with any questions we may have at all. I would like to be able to talk to them more without bothering them, and over stepping professional boundaries. I hopefully plan to ask them out once the course has ended, but I would still like to be able to have the chance to talk to them too as friends outside of course hours about the course material. Would this be ethical? Should I just back down? Specifically I wanted to thank him for giving me a very positive, in-depth feed back in the essay assignment that I had turned in that I got a perfect grade on.</p>

<p>I've been going through a really rough time in my personal life. Despite having flunked before, I made a promise to myself to work harder and to never give up on my goals. Truly their receptiveness, warmth and passion has genuinely inspired me to keep going and to study harder. I would very much like to thank them for inspiring me and being a good teacher which has helped me understand the material.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Would it be ethical to express these sentiments of admiration and gratitude to them during their office hours?</p></li>
<li><p>Would it be possible to date them after the course has ended since he is essentially a normal graduate student instead of a true professor?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>*edit 
Class has ended and we have a date planned! Thanks all for your advice!</p>

<p>*edit #2 
We are still dating and our 9 month anniversary is coming up soon! The relationship is going really well and it is the best and most loving relationship we’ve ever been in! We are excited to grow together and the mention of having children someday has come up occasionally. 
Sometimes he jokes about being my TA but he is very adamant about making it clear he didn’t like me during the course, but in conclusion we are both doing fantastic!

"An equivalent of arXiv, but for tabular and other experimental data?","<p>Suppose I'm doing some experimental work in an academic context. The essence of the results will likely be captured by documents such as conference/journal articles, technical reports, a M.Sc. or Ph.D. thesis, a monograph etc. For these kinds of artifacts, we have all sorts of avenues for long-term archiving and Internet availability: Journals have their own archives, universities make internal publications available (well, sometimes), and you can put copies on arXiv and/or sites like ResearchGate or Academia.edu (although the latter have their problems).</p>

<p>If you've produced software code - you can again use university-specific facilities, or platforms like BitbBucket, GitHub or SourceForge which recently revamped itself into relevance.</p>

<p>Where would you put raw data, though? Especially tabular data? You don't publish the (potentially large amounts) of it alongside your papers. You could put it as a file on your website, but this is limited-availability archiving/publications - it's like putting a link to a software source archive on your website. It's there, but people are much less likely to find it than if it were a repository on one of the platforms mentioned above.</p>

<p>So, my question is: Are there platforms for storing public data, in particular data obtained during academic/scientific work?</p>

<p>Notes: </p>

<ul>
<li>It doesn't quite matter if the data is accessible directly as though on an SQL database; or if you can browse it in a tabular fashion through some web interface. Those are nice options, but even something ""primitive"" as a CSV file in a standard-format URL is already passable.</li>
<li>Same goes for versioning or revision-control support: Nice to have, not a deal-breaker for a potential answer here.</li>
<li>Publications don't need to have a perma-link to the data, nor will it necessarily be archived before such publications. But again - it's a nice feature such a platform could have.</li>
<li><a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/q/987/7319"">This question</a> is highly related - almost a dupe - if you look at the title, but the body asks different questions than I do. I don't want/need the data to count as a ""paper"" or a CV-worthy publication; I don't need/want peer-reviewing of the data as a condition for it being available to the public etc.</li>
</ul>
",148216,25-04-2020 19:23,"Data publication basics - where, why, how, and when should I publish my unpublished data?","<p>Many researchers have unpublished data. Some of this data may never be published as a manuscript. But I would like to make scholarly contributions of data that I have no intent on publishing, e.g. by publishing a ""data paper""</p>

<p>The term ""data paper"" may be too new to be familiar, so here is a description from the <a href=""http://esapubs.org/archive/default.htm"">Ecological Archives</a> website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Data Papers are compilations and syntheses of data sets and associated
  metadata deemed to be of significant interest to the ESA membership
  and the scholarly community. Data papers are peer reviewed and are
  announced in abstract form in the appropriate print journal as a Data
  Paper. Data papers differ from review or synthesis papers published in
  other ESA journals in that data papers normally will not test or
  refine ecological theory. Data Papers can facilitate the rapid
  advancement of ecological knowledge and theory at the same time that
  they disseminate information. In addition, Ecological Archives
  provides a reward mechanism (in the form of peer-reviewed, citable
  objects) for the substantial effort required to compile and adequately
  document large data sets of ecological interest</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This brings up the following questions:</p>

<p>What makes a good data repository?</p>

<p>Which data repositories provide a doi: for raw data?</p>

What should you do if coauthor refuses to work on paper and refuses to consent to submit it?,"<p>My old PhD adviser and I had a falling out.

<p>The grad head has been notified, other professors have been notified. My current adviser is really pissed off about the whole situation and is planning on talking to the old one. </p>

After many years of struggle my supervisor wished to publish it in a journal with an impact factor less than 1.

I have never done any publishing beforehead, so preparing for it may take some time. Of course by doing that, I will have less time to focus on mathematics. Also it is not guranteed that the result will be published in the end. </p>

<p>Now the question is : will it be beneficial (in terms of career in mathematics) to spend time to prepare publishing my undergraduate thesis, which is different field from my current major? Will the publication make my CV stronger?</p>

<p>Of course I know it really depends on some factors such as 1.how much time will I loose by preparing the publication? 2.how is my undergraduate thesis related to the mathematics? 3.What is my future goal?, and perhabs more, so there is no single answer. I just want to listen to the opinions from more experienced. </p>

The work I did was not exactly groundbreaking but I think it was solid publishable work and could find a home in a decent journal. </p>

<p>My PI is encouraging me to write up my work and submit it for publication in the next few months but I have just started graduate school and am working in an entirely different field (Biophysics with a sprinkle of cell biology). </p>

<p>Considering that I expect writing up the work for publication will be a significant undertaking (seeing how it would be my first time writing a paper for publication), and the disparity between the subject of the paper and my current/future research, would it be worth the time commitment to follow my PIs advice and write the paper? Would there be any real benefit for my career in a different field if this work does get published?</p>

Is a PhD really required to teach?,"<p>Do teachers really need a PhD to teach? I guess the origin of this requirement was that people with PhD's were probably the only source of knowledge (unless someone is willing to go to a library, get professional help, and pour through volumes of books). However, knowledge is freely available nowadays along with organized and structured content on several topics. </p>

<p>On the other hand, most Professors with PhDs are trained well in doing research, but they have minimal to no training in teaching. The incentive structures for tenure processes also focuses a lot more on academic publications and grants, and no so much on professional development in teaching. </p>

<p>So, I ask again, wouldn't the students be better off having a teacher with only a MS degree but with training in pedagogical techniques, as opposed to someone with a PhD with neither training nor interest in pedagogy? </p>

Accessing scientific research papers post university,"<p>As part of my coping mechanism for leaving university and accepting the inevitable loss of scientific knowledge post university, I am considering subscribing to a scientific journal so that I can continue to learn and not completely lose touch.</p>

<p>However, there is not much on how I should best approach this. How does one chose the best journal? There are many out there and the subscriptions are not that clear on how they work.</p>

<p>I’ve looked online and some websites quote figures of over £1000 a year which is not feasible.</p>

<p>Individuals spend the best part of 20 years completely oblivious to the existence of journals and the process of peer review and even then we'd be lucky if 10% of those with access to journals (usually through an institution) actually bother to invest in them. </p>

<p>Granted that some journals will be totally inaccessible to those without a solid background in some particular field but by and large exposure is a good thing and there are many areas of research where individuals will benefit directly from having read these.</p>

<p>I decided I wanted to read <em>Popular Politics in the Late Medieval City: York and Bruge</em> in The English Historical Review today, mainly because it looks interesting and I'm hoping to invest more time into learning about British and European History. Incidentally I also wouldn't mind tucking into <em>Super Stable Clocks</em>, Nature 500, 505 (29 August 2013) and a number of data analysis and big data journals in order to advance my career. </p>

<p>Now, not being affiliated with an institution that subscribes to these journals means that I would typically have to pay between £5 ($10) and £15 ($25) per article that I read... I could probably spend £100 just to pass an hour by.</p>

Repository which allows anonymous authorship,"<p>This question concerns a problem related to a paper submission in the field of psychological methods. As part of the review process, I was asked by the journal's editor to provide my appendices as online documents at an author-controlled site, and not in the main text (simply to shorten the paper). Since these documents will be reviewed as part of the journal's blinded peer-review process, the authorship of these documents should be blinded as well until the publication of the paper.</p>

<p>My question is which research-related sites allow this kind of submission (i.e., a document which is made available by an URL, with anonymous authors)? As far as I know, sites like arXiv or Zenodo do not allow anonymous submissions.</p>

<p>Isn't it convenient to simply name something after yourself when no clever acronym exists? Isn't doing the work of the discovery enough to earn the right to name a thing?

Acceptable to do significant work on PhD before officially starting?,"<p>This question concerns PhD programs that, unlike most U.S. programs, don't start with a 2 year coursework program. That is, programs where you're expected to do a 2 year master before the PhD and then finish your PhD in about 3 years consisting solely of research. Let's say this concerns a PhD program at Oxford or Cambridge, UK.</p>

<p>I came to this question after reflecting on the fact that some PhD students finish their PhD in significantly shorter amount of time than average. I thought: What if we carry this to the extreme:</p>

<p>Consider the following scenario: Let's say that after obtaining a master's degree, a student spends 3 years working independently on their own research, and produces papers that in amount and quality would be sufficient for obtaining a PhD. Would it be acceptable for this student to simply register for a PhD program, and immediately hand in this work?</p>

<ul>
<li>In this way, the student is registered for the PhD program for only a very short time (the time required to hand in the work, and do the thesis defence). Therefore presumably the student has to pay tuition only for this short period rather than for 3 years.</li>

What would be a good strategy to avoid being scooped?,"<p>A few classmates and I are worried about the time lag between submitting a research paper to a conference or journal and the further time lag between rejections and re-submissions during which someone else has the chance of scooping our idea.  </p>

<p>Based on the <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/107642/what-provisions-exist-to-handle-scooping-when-there-are-multiple-reviews-of-rese"">pointers to using the Dataverse network</a> to prove that a research idea was created by a certain author at a certain point of time, I wrote to few conference organizers if they would accept the Dataverse network as a reliable reference. I received no reply.  </p>

<p>Given that a paper <a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/47b5/08abdaa5661fe14c13e8eb21935b8940126b.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">like this</a> with spelling and grammar errors did not get rejected, I conclude that lower tier journals are more eager to publish anything that comes their way. For higher tier journals/conferences, I read the rejection rate is 98%.  </p>

<p><strong>So one strategy I can think of is:</strong><br>
1. Publish an initial idea/approach in a lower tier journal, where revealing details are not presented, but the overview and results are mentioned like in <a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/705e/76bdd528ac77c8f4550bde291e0311a804f4.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this paper</a>.<br>
2. Once the paper is accepted and published, cite the published paper in a newly written paper where all details are revealed, and the concepts/results are expanded/improved on a bit more and send for publication to a top tier journal.  </p>

<p>Is this a reasonable strategy that would work or would you suggest a better approach?  </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I wrote to a number of conference organizers and journals. So far KDD and IEEE responded saying that putting up a document on arXiv is ok, before submitting it to an IEEE or KDD conference. Officially, IEEE mentions it <a href=""http://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/publish-with-ieee/author-education-resources/guidelines-and-policies/policy-posting-your-article/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and there's also their code of peer <a href=""http://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/publish-with-ieee/peer-review-ieee/ethics-peer-review/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">review ethics here</a>.

",108248,17-04-2018 06:27,What provisions exist to handle scooping when there are multiple reviews of research papers?,"<p><strong>Point 1:</strong> At my university, it's a practice (not compulsory) to submit our conference/journal paper first to a department where it is checked for plagiarism and quality. Then it's sent to professors in the university to confirm that they don't have any authorship problems with it (ie: that the student didn't copy one of their ideas, unacknowledged). It's only then that the student gets approval to send the paper to a conference (specifically <a href=""http://ieee-ssci2018.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a>) or journal.  </p>

<p><strong>Point 2:</strong> A journal or conference has it's long procedure of reviews and only some papers get accepted. If rejected or un-published, the author can send it to another conference or journal and there's a similar lapse of time.  </p>

<p>During both above situations, isn't it possible for someone else to <a href=""http://www.sciencesurvivalblog.com/phd_life/getting-scooped_2435"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">scoop</a> the idea? Does the academic community have any provisions to prevent a planned scooping? ie: Someone reviewing the paper purposely rejects it and during the time that elapses, publishes the same idea or allows one of his/her other students to publish the idea.  </p>

<p>A teacher of mine says that it's because of these fears that she directly submits papers to conferences without going through the university's process. Also, the same reason she submits to conferences instead of journals, because the journal review process is much longer, increasing the scope of the idea being scooped.  </p>

<p>So are there any safeguards? If I see my idea scooped somewhere, would it help if I can show proof that I had already submitted the idea at a conference and the paper was rejected? Will the person who supposedly scooped it, get blacklisted?</p>

Automated legal download of multiple full-text PDFs by parsing entries in bib file,"<p>I am posting this question here after being badly bruised by Mendeley in it's capabilities to handle PDFs gracefully.</p>

<p>Working from one of my university's library computers, I had downloaded PDFs of papers for later reading and citing purposes. Thus far, I always had a good experience syncing PDFs with Mendeley's web-importer extension for Google Chrome (on my personal machine).  The library machine had an unsupported browser and furthermore did not permit any extension installation, but they did have <code>Mendeley Desktop</code> already installed and available. I logged on to my account and could see the entries (including all PDFs) of my entire library and this lent me confidence.</p>

<p>In 2-3 hours, I downloaded about 65-70 relevant papers for my research. And upon dragging and dropping these files to <code>Mendeley Desktop</code>, it correctly recognised their metadata and created entries. I could even see the PDF icon which opened correctly upon double-clicking. I hit the <code>sync</code> button and left the library. The reassuring upload progress bar convinced me that everything had gone smoothly.</p>

<p>After coming home and opening <code>Mendeley Desktop</code> on my computer, I realised that although the entries for the new additions had synced, I was missing the PDFs. My university library wipes all user data from their machines overnight. Now, I could manually download all 65 of them, but this does not seem like an efficient use of my time. I am able to generate a single bib file from Mendeley though.</p>

Subsequently, he back-pedaled slightly, feeling that perhaps his demands had been too extreme, so he provided the rationalization that he would be proofreading the manuscript.  These services are neither required nor desired by the younger authors. He has been installed as an intermediate, and is termed our ""immediate superior.""  As such, he has the right to view the paper and, whether we want it or not, he can claim he proofread it and thus deserves authorship. He doesn't want to deny his boss of a co-authorship opportunity, and so he is actually demanding two tag-along co-authorships -- one for himself and one for his boss. So the question is: how many levels up the chain of command is one expected to offer free co-authorship out of professional courtesy? I am used to giving one, listed in last position, to the person who is recognized as having created the opportunity for the other author(s), and the opportunity creation is considered the <em>contribution</em> resulting in being included as a co-author. </p>

<p>My previous practice was that anyone farther removed from that should not be entitled to a co-authorship, which I saw as reserved for actual contributions. </p>

<p>This question is a reality check.  I'm not asking <em>what to do</em> about the situation, I'm just asking whether the extension to an additional level of <em>co-authorship as professional courtesy</em> is standard, acceptable practice.</p>

<p>--------- Original question below ---------</p>

<p>We are a very small group that received a research grant approximately three years ago.  For roughly the first year and a half no relevant paper was generated.  I joined about a year ago and published the first paper aligned with our grant and I have a few more manuscripts in review so I've been somewhat productive.  The other two postdocs (one hired a year before me and the other a couple of months after me) haven't published any relevant work and don't have anything relevant in the immediate timeline and so there is concern that our grant may be in danger of being terminated.  </p>

<p>To address this concern, the group director hired someone from a lab who agreed to visit on a part-time basis to lead the research effort since we are actually part of a teaching institution with little mandate or infrastructure for research.  Because I actually have a steady stream of submissions in the pipeline and am actually generating output -- and possibly because he is seeking to build his resume -- he wanted to be included in my submissions even if he didn't contribute in any way.  His argument was that: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a rule...you should add XXX (as the director of YYY) and myself (as Scientific Advisor and your supervisor) as co-authors on all your papers. The feedback and review on the paper (as proofreader or otherwise) and the comments provided constitute enough of a scientific contribution to warrant authorship, not to mention quality control, accurate acknowledgment of the work &amp; grants, proper framing of the story, and relevant missing citations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tend to be fairly nice about including folks in my manuscripts: I've included folks either because (1) they've earned it (by making some substantive contribution) or (2) I felt generous and wanted to give them some exposure.  What I feel a bit queasy about is when someone demands authorship for what amounts to non-scientific help, such as proofreading, quality control, etc.  Sure, those things can be substantial but they can also be negligible.  My experience has been that those sort of help would happen in an exchange sort of way (""I'll proof your paper if you'll proof mine."").  I'm good with adding on the funding author as last author -- as is the convention in my discipline -- but, adding an author who doesn't contribute any substance yet feels entitled, is a bit difficult...not to mention possibly unethical.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on this?  </p>
",108335,19-04-2018 00:58,Is it common to claim co-authorship by helping writing a paper without doing any research,"<p>In my research group, there is a researcher who usually approaches other PhD students who are about to write papers in order to offer his help. Normally, he does not actually do any research related to the paper. Instead, he reads our papers, makes comments about the writing style and sometime re-writes some sections in order to make them more readable. At the end, he will claim the co-authorship of the paper. I can see it is very helpful for new PhD students who don't have much experience in writing papers or articles. However, it is sometime uncomfortable for me to see someone who doesn't do actual research but still manages to get an authorship.</p>

<p>So, I want to ask if it is a common practice for someone to help writing a paper without doing any actual research relating to it, and claim the co-authorship. If it is not, how should I react if someone wants to do the same to me?</p>

Why do so many people go into Academia when the career prospects are so grim?,"<p>Judging by a lot of the questions on this site, a career in Academia sounds very grim. Lots of pressure, extreme working ours, few benefits, mediocre salary, and, because one has to work with so many different people (supervisors, students, collaborators, HR, editors, etc., etc), one is more likely to run into social issues, as evidenced by the questions on this site. </p>

<p>So why then do so many people go into Academia? Is it really just a reason not to grow up? </p>

<p>""Passion for the field"" doesn't sound very convincing either, when one considers that only a small, small minority of Academia actually produce worthwhile, interesting results. The rest are just scrambling for any sort of recognition by constantly publishing mediocre results that will be cited twice over the course of the next 10 years. Rinse and repeat. Really, a lot of these people are just glorified teachers whose main contribution is giving lectures or conferences. When one considers the rising academic dishonesty, fabrication, plagiarism, and so on, the picture becomes even worse. </p>

",108724,26-04-2018 10:13,What to do about questions that are designed to embarrass the speaker?,"<p>I've attended a lot of seminars and lectures by now, and it's typical for the chair of the seminar to offer audience members a chance to ask questions of the speaker about their work after the presentation.</p>

<p>Most of the time, the questions seek clarification of some aspect of the presentation or focus on a more comprehensive understanding of the research involved.</p>

<p>However, occasionally, I've noticed that questions are purposefully designed to embarrass the speaker.  Things along the lines of ""That method won't work at all for what you're trying to do.  Your results are completely invalid"" or ""So-and-so's group already did that work years ago.  Did you not read their paper?""</p>

<p>Perhaps more disturbingly (I just got back from a really large conference if you can't tell), is that women seem to be more harshly criticized than men, and over trivial issues.  For instance, in a few sessions I went to, female graduate students were given really hard times over their presentations while the male grad students were not.  All presentations were about the same quality.  I guess I'm a little shocked; I'd heard of sexism in academia but hadn't actually seen it (or noticed it) until this conference.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, I've observed that it's typically prestigious professors or researchers that are asking these ostentatious questions.  I suppose they figure they have enough ""fame"" or whatever that their job isn't in jeopardy, and there's no easy way to really prove they're being rude or sexist.</p>

<p>I don't know what's going on here, but it seems to me that these questions, even if they do have technical merit, should be held until after the seminar, where they can be discussed privately with the researcher.</p>

<p>My question here, specifically, is what can be done to minimize these (uncomfortable for everyone) instances?  My thoughts are that a session chair should remind the audience to refrain from questions that are accusatory in nature.  As a presenter, I'm not sure what can be done in advance to preempt and avoid these questions.  Any ideas?</p>

How far will my Masters counterbalance low undergrad GPA in PhD applications?,"<p>I'm currently pursuing a Masters degree in Philosophy at a top UK university, and as my grades currently stand, I'm looking to graduate with a Distinction.</p>

<p>During my second and third years of undergraduate study, I was struggling with diagnosing and dealing with a medical issue. Unfortunately, this affected my grades in several modules throughout those two years. My undergraduate degree transcript features a patchwork mixture of Firsts, 2.1s and then a couple of those 2.2 grades. As a result, I graduated with a low 2.1 overall. Of course, this is all documented, supported by my physicians, and my supervisors were aware of my situation.</p>

My question is quite general, and I don't wish to provide more background for fear of bias in the answers.</p>

<p>My question: Is it is advisable/possible/unfavorable/favorable to apply for a PhD in a field, different from that in which you have done most of your undergraduate research?</p>

<p>My research (includes just reading and understanding papers, writing summaries until now, I havent published anything) mostly includes Quantum field theory, and gauge theory. Would the selection committee turn down an application to a pure maths field, if I have no research experience whatsoever?</p>

<p>I would also like to ask the question other way round. What if I concentrate my undergraduate research SOLELY on topics in pure maths such as algebraic geometry/topology and take other physics courses, would I be able to apply to a string theory PhD with a high chance of success?</p>

<p>Should I consider spending time on both of these (which is almost an impossible task), to improve my chances in both the areas or would research in one area, and grad level courses in the other suffice?</p>

<p><strong>In brief: Should the PhD field you are applying to be the same as your undergraduate research area?</strong></p>

How does being in academia help researchers,"<p>I have read about many great researchers in various fields who were not involved in academia throughout their lives. Some were involved in academia only part of their life, but almost invariably, their greatest work came after a period of solitude and isolation from others. In fact, most great mathematicians, for example, were rather isolated figures. Bernhard Riemann and Isaac Newton come to mind, but others like James Clerk Maxwell were also isolated during their periods of research. More recently, Andrew Wiles isolated himself for around 7 years and didn't speak about his work to anyone while he was busy solving Fermat's Last Theorem. (I have mentioned only mathematicians because those are the ones I have read about the most.)</p>

<p>Hence, I am failing to see how being in academia/a university position aids one as a researcher, practically speaking. It seems as though the greatest research must come from within the individual due to an intense and personal love and desire for the subject, rather than due to collaborating with others or being given a better position or whatever. In fact, such things seem to be the opposite: detrimental. They would make the person focus not on the subject but on paltry things like gaining more and more money or a better reputation.</p>

<p>My question is simply: How does being in university position (e.g. professor) aid the researchers who are at the highest level in their field? I do not mean being <em>involved</em> in academia, because one can be involved (eg attending seminars and lectures) without having a position (please correct me if I am wrong, as I myself am not actually in academia).</p>
",109752,14-05-2018 16:04,Why do researchers need universities?,"<p>This is a follow-up question to <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/100923/how-are-junior-professors-evaluated-for-promotion"">How are junior professors evaluated for promotion?</a> and probably an even more naive question. If I'm understanding the answer correct, professors need funding to do research, but once they get it, the university takes some of the grant as overheads (to pay for office space, electricity, etc), and the cut the university takes is substantial.</p>

<p>Given that then, why do professors need universities? One could just apply for the grant as per normal, and once one gets it, buy a slightly bigger house and convert one of the rooms into a lab. One loses nothing to overheads, gets to work from home, has zero teaching duties, can choose to settle anywhere (no two-body problem!), and can even monitor an experiment 24/7. This gets even easier if one works in a field that doesn't need a physical lab. Further, presumably the grant covers postdoc salaries, so one would still be able to pay for postdocs (although probably not PhD students since a professor without a university will not be able to award a degree). </p>

<p>The obvious answer is that one cannot apply for a grant without a university, but Google indicates that's not the case, e.g. <a href=""https://www.nsa.gov/what-we-do/research/math-sciences-program/proposal-guidelines/"" rel=""noreferrer"">NSA grants in mathematics</a> only looks at one's previous accomplishments &amp; potential applications of the research result, both of which are independent of the university. I suppose one could lose journal access, but there's always stuff like arXiv / ResearchGate, emailing the authors of the desired paper, or even Scihub (oops). It's conceivable that not working for a university loses one some prestige, since one can no longer claim to be a professor. However even then I'd expect at least some academics to choose this path, valuing the convenience &amp; extra research funding over prestige.</p>

<p>If the answer to this varies from field to field, I'm most interested in the sciences. </p>

How important is your school?,"<p>I am looking to pursue an online master's in MIS starting next spring. I'm in the process of deciding on a school and I've narrowed it down to two choices: Florida State or Illinois-Springfield.</p>

<p>Both are accredited, but I'm trying to think about which would benefit me more in the long run. Florida State seems to be the more well-known, popular university, and, I would assume, would ""pop"" more on a resume. However, each credit hour is $810 and the program itself is upwards of $27,800.</p>

<p>In contrast, UIS is a much smaller school, and probably less well known. However, their program is $403 an hour and would come out closer to the $15,000 range.</p>

<p>I could probably pay for the UIS degree out of pocket, but FSU would require me to get loans.</p>

I am pursuing a Master's level degree in Computer Science in hopes of furthering my web development career.  I would love to be able to teach web development/programming at a community college someday after getting a few more years of industry experience (teaching requires at least a Master's degree).  Previously I taught secondary science before transitioning into web development.</p>

<p>I've been accepted to the following programs:</p>

<p><strong>Boston University</strong> - Master's in Computer Information Systems / Web Application Development  (U.S. News ranked #51 nationally)</p>

<p><strong>Brandeis University</strong> - Master's of Software Engineering (U.S. News ranked #31 nationally)</p>

<p><strong>University of Bridgeport</strong> - Master's of Computer Science (not ranked nationally)</p>

<p>I keep going back and forth in regards to which program I should choose.  University of Bridgeport seems to have a good curriculum and it looks like it will be cheaper (I may get a scholarship), but I'm concerned that it's not viewed as a ""top"" school.  I would be happy to pay for a more expensive school if it helped provide greater opportunities in the future.</p>

<p>Do you find that going to a ""better"" school has affected your resume to the point that you may have more teaching opportunities after school?  I realize that a certain school won't earn me the actual position, but having a highly regarded school on my resume MAY lead me to getting more interviews.  Any insights are greatly appreciated.</p>

Is it unethical to acknowledge a researcher without contacting him,"<p>I'm a masters student in mathematics and I gave a seminar talk about my main result.

<p>It just so happens that a few years ago I did a PhD with a supervisor that does not like the arXiv that much (he apparently had some conflict with some authors of a paper that was very similar to one of his papers, but one was already published while the other was just an arXiv preprint -or something like that). As a result, from my list of less than 20 publications, there are four of them from my PhD that are missing on the arXiv.</p>

<p>I was thinking of submitting the latest versions I have of them as arXiv preprints now, four years after their publication. For this I already have the agreement of all co-authors (including my supervisor), and all the journals involved seem to allow to put preprints of the material they publish. Do you see any problem with this? I fear that some people might take it as a way to advertise as new something that was already published a long time ago (though I would of course give the full reference to the published version). There may be other issues I am not aware of. The reason why I would like to do this is that I am applying for fellowships, positions, etc. and I am afraid some of my (best) publications may go unnoticed if somebody looks me up on the arXiv.</p>

Is it important to do a PhD at a different institution than undergrad?,"<p>I'm currently studying at a good school and I was admitted to do a PhD here. I got into some other good schools for my PhD, but for various reasons (e.g. less of a good research fit, weather, etc.) I feel that my current school would remain the best fit for me for grad school. I feel very, very happy here every day and I am very interested in the research taking place here.</p>

<p>My advisor is pushing me to go somewhere else as he says it will allow me to grow and do better research. Other professors have more of an indifferent view of my choice and said that I can't go wrong when choosing among the schools.</p>

How does endowment chair work,"<p>A chair professor is a position from endowment, whose title often starts with a name (of donor). I wonder what is the exact difference between chair professors and normal faculty members as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is a chair generally required no duty of teaching? </li>
<li>What is the pay source of a chair? From endowment alone and not from the department budget? </li>
</ul>

<p>I have seen many chair professors also teach. So their salaries can come from both sources, right?</p>

<p>I understand that the people whom the chairs are named after are rich and donated money to the school in the past.

Does a gap of 10 months after Master's degree affect my chances for a future academic career?,"<p>I am soon to submit my PhD thesis and I am currently looking for postdoc positions. I would eventually like to stay in academia and was concerned if my past gap year would harm my chances in getting a position.</p>

<p>After my master's degree, I got an R&amp;D job and worked there for 4 months before quitting it as I did not enjoy it there. My plan was to join my master's lab as a research fellow, and I had an offer for that from my advisor. But, I got a bad disease and I fell ill for 3 months. I was not hospitalized, but had to live with my parents for the period.
As I always wanted to pursue PhD, I was searching for a position in the meantime. During the 3 months, I gave GRE (scored poorly, thanks to my illness) and applied to universities and professors. I got a positive response and I was sure of getting a PhD position.</p>

<p>However, it was already February and if I were to join a PhD program, I would have to wait till September. Also, the visa process and other formalities take time. So, I decided to not go further with the research fellow, and take time to complete the visa processing, spend time with parents and travel around.</p>

<p>I had a blast of time. Learned so much during that time. But, I don't have anything concrete to show for that 9-10 months period.</p>

<p>My concern is, how much will that affect my future career?</p>

Is there any anonymous website that authors can rate journal submission experience?,"<p>Yet again one of my papers is just stuck in limbo at a journal for over 6 months now. One referee has seemingly returned his review and the second referee is playing truant.</p>

<p>I knew this after a polite email to the administrative secretary 3 months after submission. She promised to send an email to nudge the late referee.</p>

<p>Now, after 6 months, I write to the editor in chief to get to know what is going on and he has not bothered to reply for over 2 weeks now.</p>

<p>When I review for this same journal, all of my reviews are returned in time. I setup a google calender reminder 2 weeks prior to my the deadline that I accept and then push everything aside for those 2 weeks to turn in a high quality report. I am going to politely decline any more invitations to review from this journal. The journal is prestigious but there are other less prestigious journals that offer faster review times. At some point in time, the prestige of the journal has to make way for faster dissemination of important results.</p>

<p>I also suspect that the journal is clubby. I have seen rotten articles written by folks in ""elite"" universities while I have had rejections from that journal even though I proved more theoretical results on a problem (I am an operations researcher) that was published in the same journal. I suspect the journal worries about the authors' zipcode. I published this article in a different journal eventually. </p>

How can I politely remind my professors about a recommendation letter they promised?,"<p>I am currently applying to a masters program, application is due on April 15, recommendation letters can be given until the 23.</p>

<p>I asked 3 professors to give me recommendation letters approximately on march 14.
One of them already submitted it, but 2 haven't.</p>

<p>I don't want to be excessively insistent, because A) they did tell me they were busy when I asked, and B) I made a grave personal mistake towards one of the professors a long time ago, and the simple fact that he agreed to give me a recommendation letter is, I think, enough for me to never ask him for any favors in my life time.</p>

<p>The nearest deadline is 10 days away. I have asked about this in late January and I haven't gotten anything yet.</p>

<p>I need at least 3 letters, and I have only asked to 4 professors, one of which didn't answer so I think he doesn't want to write me one (for a reason I ignore). I may have made a mistake and should've asked more professors, that's on me. The point is I don't want to upset because if at least one of them decides that I am too annoying I can already cross half of the schools I wanted off the list.</p>

Is it possible to get a researcher position in a prestigious institute with a degree from a not very well-ranked university?,"<p>I'm currently in the 2nd year of my Ph.D. and I'm really interested in my future career options. I'm attending a double-degree study programme in two European universities, none of them being among the top ones. But, I'm employed as a researcher (not only a Ph.D. student) in a supercomputing center in one of them (member of PRACE, 3 years ago in top 40 from TOP500 list) since the beginning of my Master's degree, thanks to Dean's award for my Bachelor's thesis. Five years ago it was a top university in my country (slightly under 300 in QS WU rankings), but then the directorship changed and the ranking dropped drastically (to my shock completely out of QS WU rankings). The second university shares a pretty similar fate - from about 300th place to 520+ in the last 7 years (I have no idea, what happened), but still maintains at least 151-200 position in my field.

<ul>
<li>While applying for post-docs/faculty positions in academia</li>
<li>While applying to industrial research labs</li>
</ul>

<p>For instance, I've read on some forums (I can't locate the link now) that while considering prospective applications for tenure-track faculty positions, very few Universities accept a candidate who has completed his/her Ph.D from a lower ranked school having a lesser ""brand"" value, irrespective of the fact whether he/she has published equally original work as his/her counterpart from an Ivy league college. How much truth is in this statement? It would be really great if someone already in academia, either as a newly-accepted faculty or someone on the Faculty Hiring committee could share their experiences/statistics on this regard. I'm simply interested to know the answer, without commenting at all on whether such a practice is justifiable.</p>

<p>Similarly, what about recruitment to internationally acclaimed research labs (like <a href=""http://www.watson.ibm.com/overview.shtml"">IBM T.J.Watson lab</a> or <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/default.aspx"">Microsoft research lab</a>) - what importance do they place on the pedigree of a candidate's college, before taking into consideration what they published ?</p>

<p>I'm personally interested in answers related to the field of Computer Science (theory), but the question is applicable to any prospective grad student in any discipline in my opinion. Feel free to share your personal experiences post-Ph.D in detail, as that would give me (and future viewers of this question) about what its like to carve a career once you are out of school!</p>

I am close to completion of my thesis but I am not very proud of my work. I have couple of publications from my work, all in decent journals. I feel that I have not utilized the opportunities available to me and wasted time in personal activities that did nothing to my CV. </p>

<p>Owing to my inadequate performance during PhD. I am constantly regretting my decision of pursuing higher studies. I was never a star student. My undergrad was from a very low ranking school where I had received very average grades. However, I somehow got into the top graduate school where too I struggled in getting average grades. My research there was very unimpressive and not a single professor urged me to pursue PhD. My master's advisor even expressed shock when I had asked for his recommendation for applying to PhD school.</p>

<p>However, luck struck again, and I got into a reputed PhD program. My advisor has had a lot of patience with me. She is a hands off kind of person, but she has never complained about my performance till date. Now as I am completing my thesis, I am confused about my future career trajectory.</p>

<p>I feel like I do not belong to academia or research industry as I don't possess the necessary skills (sound technical skills, exceptional analytical skills and focus). I feel like a failure who is in a wrong profession. I really don't know what to do now.</p>

<p>My only reason for pursuing PhD in my current field of study was that I loved the process of researching. I loved finding reason behind why a physical phenomenon occurs. But, I now feel that just love for research is not an adequate reason for doing PhD or master's degree.</p>

<p>In short; I have realized that I am not not suitable for academia or research industry as I don't possess the necessary skills for pursuing research. I should have taken the engineering job after my undergrad as I was never built for a life in research.</p>
",129590,24-04-2019 07:48,How should I deal with becoming discouraged as a graduate student?,"<p>I am a third year (starting fourth year in the fall) PhD student in mathematics. I've passed all qualifying exams and am currently doing research. As far as I can tell, I am not doing poorly. I have the good fortune of having a great advisor, being in a very supportive department, and having friends and family who genuinely care about my success. </p>

<p>The fact is research is hard. It appears to consist primarily of staring at a problem for days and days and days without getting anywhere. Sometimes, rarely, I do figure something out and that feels wonderful, but the overwhelming majority of my time appears to be spent banging my head against a mostly figurative wall. I am not complaining about the material being hard, and I am not averse to putting in hard work, but I get frequently discouraged when I realize the vast volumes of mathematics that I yet know nothing about (and probably never will). It's very hard to quantify progress - in particular, there are too few tangible returns after too many hours worked. I find myself thinking along the lines of ""Oh, if only someone actually smart were thinking about this problem they would have solved it in moments"" and so on. </p>

<p>I've talked about this to some number of people; here is some advice I have received:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take a day off. Putting in hours upon hours of trying things doesn't magically lead to a solution, particularly if the brain is tired and just wants to sleep.</li>
<li>Have a hobby. Since math research doesn't exactly provide instant gratification, a hobby might provide some instead. </li>
<li>Talk to other graduate students. Realize that many graduate students go through this.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm interested to know how other folks have dealt with being discouraged as a graduate student. Does it get better with time and experience? Is this a sign that research is not for me and that I should seriously consider a life outside academia?</p>

Referencing cited authors,"<p>This problem comes up a lot when I write text that describes other's work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>to enable personalized Web searches was first proposed in [32], however in [9] it was showed to be computationally inefficient. [33] iterated upon the method and made it suitable for real-time use....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is if this is poor style? I've written such paragraphs myself but I have also seen them in real, published research. Hence the question.</p>
",129728,26-04-2019 17:15,Can cited works hold grammatical positions in sentences?,"<p>Though I read this style quite often, I was recently told unambiguously by a reviewer that I was NOT supposed to use citations ""as if they are objects in a sentence.""  The following sentence is an example of what the reviewer considered unacceptable:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We analyzed the data using the Wilmerding method, guided by [12].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The references section might include the following: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[12] Smith, D., Marshawn, J., &amp; Devenshaw, A. 2011. <em>Techniques and
  Procedures for Applying the Wilmerding Method.</em>  Prince Publications,
  Inc, New York, NY.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Wilmerding method<sup>1</sup> is not a step-by-step algorithm that can be precisely followed as if by a machine, and thus [12] does not provide a step-by-step algorithmic description but rather guidance for using  the method. [12] is a relatively slim but authoritative textbook about how to use the Wilmerding method.</p>

<p>Within this question, for the purpose of discussion, I have intentionally put [12] in grammatical positions where it's an important element of the sentence and the sentence would make less sense without the reference.  Sometimes that seems to be the most efficient way to communicate the intended message.  <strong>Is using a reference as a grammatical sentence element like this OK?   Why might this not be considered acceptable?   Should I be rewording those sentences?  Is it enough of a violation to be worth passing the note on to authors of papers I review?</strong> </p>

<p>I considered posting this on <a href=""http://english.stackexchange.com"">EL&amp;U</a> but it seems more specific to academia than general English usage, and the comment came from a content reviewer rather than a copy editor.  <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/36624/is-it-acceptable-to-include-author-names-as-a-substantive-part-of-a-sentence-as"">This question</a> is related but it seems to be more about when to put authors names' in vs. outside of the parentheses in an APA-like style. </p>

"Does still it matter to be the ""first author"" nowadays","<p>It used to be that the first author (meaning, the author whose name comes before the others) is thought to have contributed most to the publication.</p>

<p>But in the last couple of decades, it seems that the first author no longer matters AT ALL, instead the last person has become the most important. </p>

<p>I attribute my observation to two things,</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The first author is typically a student, someone with no name recognition, or someone who is getting advised or funded by the last author.</p></li>
<li><p>The last author is typically the director or advisor of the project. In recent years many of these people have become ultra famous through things like TEDtalks and other media hype. It didn't use to be this way before the internet. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Nowadays whenever I evaluate how potentially interesting a paper is in my field (stem), before I even read it, I almost always look at the last author, especially if it is someone famous. If I don't recognize anyone, I am quick to assume that the paper is not interesting. I am trying to fight back against my bias. </p>

<p>Does being the ""first author"" still carry any weight in today's academic culture?</p>
",129747,27-04-2019 08:12,What does first authorship really mean?,"<p>In my field (theoretical computer science), authors of any paper are always listed alphabetically; our papers <a href=""http://www.ams.org/profession/leaders/culture/CultureStatement04.pdf"">don't have ""first authors""</a>.  (Well... hardly ever.)  In most other disciplines, at least within science and engineering, the ordering of authors is a signal about their relative contributions to the paper, with the first author indicating the most significant contributor.  Hiring and promotion committees do give extra weight to ""first-author papers"" (and sometimes have to be reminded that not all areas have them).  As an outsider, I find this practice confusing.</p>

<p><strong>What does first authorship actually mean in your discipline?</strong> I understand vaguely that the first author is supposed to be the one who ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_author"">did the most work</a>"", but what counts as ""work"" in this comparison?  Does ""most"" mean ""more than all the other coauthors together"" or just ""more than any other coauthor""?  What happens when the comparison is unclear?   How often is ""did the most work"" the actual truth, versus a cover story for a more complex political decision?</p>

<p>I realize that the precise answer is different for every paper.  <strong>I'm looking for general guidelines</strong> for how an outsider (like me) should interpret first authorship <em>in your field</em>.  Pointers to guidelines from journals or professional societies would be especially helpful.</p>

<p>Please give only one answer per discipline.</p>

Why does academia still use scientific journals and not peer-reviewed government funded alternatives?,"<p>The field of science is under-funded but we follow a publication system that has two major (expensive) options for publishing:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Paywall journals</strong>: Scientists do the science and write the papers
(using mainly tax money). Scientists act as editors and reviewers
check the quality (while paid with more tax money). Once years of
work have gone into a paper the journal takes it without paying the
authors, academic editors and/or reviewers a single cent and puts
the paper behind a paywall. Now universities have to pay the journal
huge amounts of money (exact numbers are usually not available due to NDAs) to access the paper to which the journal did
not contribute anything (apart from minor formatting issues and
putting a pdf on a webpage maybe).</li>
<li><strong>Open access journals</strong>: Same as above (scientists do all the work) but
authors even pay the journal a substantial amount of money which can
easily go up to 6000 USD in ""respected"" journals (I am not talking
about predatory open-access journals here – the 6k is for example
for the journals of the American Chemical Society which publishes a
few of the leading journals in our field). For this amount of money
the journals do the minor formatting issues mentioned above and
upload a pdf on their webpage. There is just no relation between
their fees and what they do for it. Here 60-100 USD would be more appropriate than 6000 USD.</li>
</ol>

<p>Is this not fundamentally wrong that scientists do the work and journals skim off the profit? Why do scientists (and tax payers!) still put up with this? </p>

<p>I do understand that historically :</p>

<ul>
<li>Journals made sense as someone needed to print the
articles into books to make them accessible to everybody and
layouting might have been something non-trivial but nowadays this is
not the case any-more.</li>
<li>Scientists have brought themselves into a dead-lock due to a
publish (in high impact and ""respected"" journals)    or perish in
which you have to publish in certain journals in order    to be seen
as a good scientist.</li>
</ul>

<p>But would it not make much more sense to have tax-money funded    web-portals that use editors and reviewers to assess quality of    articles and make them available for download as journals do it currently? That would cost a fraction of    the paywall and open access fees that journals make money from at the    moment.</p>

<p>Why does science still stick with journals? My feeling is that the field of science does not need the journals at all anymore - what am I missing here? I have never really gotten a satisfactory answer from other scientists (mostly things like ""this is how things are and we can not change them"") therefore I am asking here  ...</p>

<p><em>The question <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/86686/why-are-journals-used-in-modern-scientific-academic-research"">Why are journals used in modern scientific academic research?</a> has a title that sounds similar but the question goes into Arxiv and the answer are in regard to this (""Arxiv is not peer reviewed"") which is not the issue discussed here.</em></p>
",129763,27-04-2019 17:39,Why are journals used in modern scientific academic research?,"<p>I am new to research and I have yet to internalize the concept of journals and their utility in archiving scientific literature.</p>

<p>Almost all the papers I have read recently are from this website called <a href=""https://arxiv.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">arxiv</a>. Arxiv calls itself to be a preprint archive. Anyone can upload a PDF file to the repository and it counts as a valid research. Large companies like Google and Facebook post all their research here. <strike>The research is peer reviewed,</strike> It does not have <strike>the tyranny of</strike> a fixed format and the publishing is instantaneous unlike journals which are painfully slow. It is also open access and unlike open access journals it does not cost a fortune to publish a paper.</p>

<p>My question is, why were journals used to begin with? Why are they used now? </p>

<p>I have heard some people say that if a paper is not published in a <a href=""https://www.scopus.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">scopus indexed</a> journal then it does not have any value.

- Obviously, the number of paper per year is highly field specific. So is citation counts (which includes all the analysis it comes with such as average citation counts, h factors, impact factor of a journal and so on).
- Several countries such as the New Zealand, have their own research evaluation system in which one of the important evaluation criterion for research-groups or even individuals is the number of papers published in one to six years span. The data for average number of papers by individuals in different disciplines may put these evaluations in perspective with the global averages. e.g., individual publishing two paper per year in a sub branch where the average number of papers per year by individuals is one should not be directly compared to those publishing 10 papers a year in subbranches in which 15 papers per year is the average norm.

<p>I have just finished my first year with a cumulative GPA of 3.55. However, with that I have also received an F on 1st year Writing due to late submission. The excusable reasons were lack of motivation and the pressure from 3 cumulative finals, but the main reason was my procrastination habits. I wonder if grad schools will single out this F as me being a potentially irresponsible person, or will they overlook it if I get good results on most of the other courses.

",150752,19-06-2020 18:18,How should I deal with becoming discouraged as a graduate student?,"<p>I am a third year (starting fourth year in the fall) PhD student in mathematics. I've passed all qualifying exams and am currently doing research. As far as I can tell, I am not doing poorly. I have the good fortune of having a great advisor, being in a very supportive department, and having friends and family who genuinely care about my success. </p>

<p>The fact is research is hard. It appears to consist primarily of staring at a problem for days and days and days without getting anywhere. Sometimes, rarely, I do figure something out and that feels wonderful, but the overwhelming majority of my time appears to be spent banging my head against a mostly figurative wall. I am not complaining about the material being hard, and I am not averse to putting in hard work, but I get frequently discouraged when I realize the vast volumes of mathematics that I yet know nothing about (and probably never will). It's very hard to quantify progress - in particular, there are too few tangible returns after too many hours worked. I find myself thinking along the lines of ""Oh, if only someone actually smart were thinking about this problem they would have solved it in moments"" and so on. </p>

<p>I've talked about this to some number of people; here is some advice I have received:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take a day off. Putting in hours upon hours of trying things doesn't magically lead to a solution, particularly if the brain is tired and just wants to sleep.</li>
<li>Have a hobby. Since math research doesn't exactly provide instant gratification, a hobby might provide some instead. </li>
<li>Talk to other graduate students. Realize that many graduate students go through this.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm interested to know how other folks have dealt with being discouraged as a graduate student. Does it get better with time and experience? Is this a sign that research is not for me and that I should seriously consider a life outside academia?</p>

Ethical Problems Brought by Academic Paywalls,"<p>The question is simple. I am working on a topic. I came across a paper that is behind a paywall which my research institution (i.e. university) has no access to it and it may or may not be relevant to my research. If I skip it and some reviewer says that work is quite close to the work I have submitted and I should cite it, or even worse it is so close that it is on the edges of plagiarism. </p>

<p><strong>I have the option of obtaining it from different sources without paying. Should I take it to avoid such claim?</strong> If I pay there is a good chance that I wasted money. In today's world literature is so vast and there are so many false positives and a paper might cost up to 40 bucks.</p>

<p>Let me flip that question. Suppose I created a publishing firm. I and my mates do superb research and publish on a journal of our publishing firm. (Assume our research quality is good, so omit academic nepotism.) One catch, our firm charges and exorbitant fee (say millions) for granting access to libraries and universities. Then we start waiting. When I see other research quite similar to ours, I press charges that our work has not been cited or acknowledged and the situation is plagiarism. I am the academic equivalent of a patent troll, except that you cannot see my work until I sue you. <strong>Should the poor guy suffer a plagiarism charge just because I kept my research behind a paywall that he/she cannot reach?</strong></p>

<p>Professors and other academic people I ask about it pretend to be either unconscious or dead. Just kidding, they usually offer to send the papers that I cannot reach. But it does not answer my question.</p>

<p>p.s. There is a similar question here citing the problem but not the ethical dilemma. <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/71970/are-there-any-known-universities-that-refuse-to-pay-for-paywall-access-to-academ"">Are there any known Universities that refuse to pay for paywall access to academic journals?</a></p>

<p><strong>EDIT due to possible duplicate reports</strong>: There are three questions which all refer to the same problem: unfettered access to academic research. I paraphrase and summarise three questions below. Suppose there is a body of research (say, group of articles) that are beyond the researcher's reach due to lack of resources (no ILL, no institution access, no sufficient budget etc). Should the researcher take the ""gray"" ways to obtain it? If not is he/she responsible for research he/she does not have access to? If so, where do we draw the line? How much is too much to pay to access research? (hence the publisher question) It is not the 80s anymore. Research is published almost faster than one can read and it is readily available (at an inflated cost). So, thorough examination of literature to conduct original research is unjustifiably more expensive than before.</p>

Structuring two first authors equal contribution in computer science publication,"<p>Sorry if this is a naive question. We tried finding guidelines, but have failed to find concrete advice. </p>

<p>There are N authors (where N>2) in our publication. Two authors have equal contribution. We are aware of the custom of putting an asterisk and writing a footnote about equal contribution.</p>

",88058,14-04-2017 01:33,Why do people sometimes put authors with equal contribution in non-alphabetical order?,"<p>I've seen papers (e.g., in <em>Science</em>) where the first two authors are listed in non-alphabetical order, and yet there are asterisks behind their names to say that they contributed equally. </p>

<p>It seems strange to me, because if the two authors are in alphabetical order, then it could be that the first author contributed more or the two contributed equally, and this can be made clear with asterisks in the paper if it's the latter case. When they're in non-alphabetical order, however, if someone only sees the author list without seeing the paper, he/she will likely assume that the first author contributed most.</p>

How much damage could a 'C' in Abstract Algebra Course cause? and How to minimize the effect?,"<p>I'm an undergraduate math major student in my junior year. I've taken Abstract Algebra 1 last fall. I got  a C in that class (I got 65%). In most of my previous courses I got A's, and in some courses I got B's. I know that such a grade would cause much damage to my application (I intend  for graduate programs that I intend to apply for next winter, while being in my senior year).  I want to point out some things regarding my situation:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In my college, we can not re-take a passed course no matter what, that is, I can not re-take the course (I wished if I got F in that class so that I can re-take it and get a better grade, but I passed it with 65 point from 100). So I can not re-take it and it will be in my final transcript which will be sent to the programs I'm applying for. </p></li>
<li><p>This semester, I'm taking Abstract Algebra II and I'm aiming to get as high grade as I could, I wonder if doing so would minimize the damage of this C. </p></li>
<li><p>My GPA was 3.8 of 5 (~88%) before my fall semester, now it's 3.6 (86%), in a great part due to this C.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>My question</em></strong> is: how much damage such a grade would cause? What are the best ways to minimize those damages? Do I have any chances to get admitted to good school with this C in my transcript? What about top schools like Berekely etc? Do I even have a chance?</p>

<p>Regarding the possible duplicate: Although the answer in the proposed question is great, I think that my question may have more specific answer since it is directed towards a specific field namely, mathematics. So, an emphasize on reference letters, research experience  or motivation letters may be more significant and crucial in math more than in other disciplines. Hence, I believe a more specific and tailored answer can be provided to my question rather than a general answer for bad grades.</p>

<p>Some (Clarifying but un-important) remarks: </p>

<p>Some people may think that I'm not good enough and this was the reason I got C in that class but I want to point some facts regarding that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In my university, this course is not a challenging course, so it's normally easy to pass it with a good grade because the material and the treatment is not advanced or demanding. I got A's in the most demanding courses in my department. Regarding getting a C, this was due to several factors: First of all, I faced some problems in the two days before the exam, I went to the final exam without any sleep for a period of nearly 30-35 hours and I was very tired, I was sleeping in the exam and fully exhausted mentally. I faced some psychological problems for most time in this fall semester which had bad effect on my grades in general, but specially, the situation was catastropic in the algebra course. This C is not due to my lack of knowledge: in fact, I've mastered the topics in the course since High School (It's a Group Theory course - I went through most of Dummit and Foote doing almost all of the exercises in my high school years). It was due to an urgent problems at the time. </p></li>
<li><p>I'm not a bad student, as an indication for that: in the same semester, I've attended two graduate courses, one in Module Theory and the second in Forcing (set theory) and both of the professors considered me as one of the best students in the class although I was the only undergraduate. Sadly, we can not take graduate courses for credit in my uni, so my attendance was not official, I was attending because I wanted to learn the stuff. Also, I've attended a graduate course in Algebraic Logic in my sophomore year, and same impressions were made by the professor. In my sophomore year, I was meeting some professors regularly to guide me to self-study Category theory and Commutative Algebra. </p></li>
<li><p>My GPA is currently the HIGHEST GPA among my fellows in the same program, which may indicate that such a C is not normal for me. </p></li>
<li><p>Some people may ask, why did you take this course if you already know the material? Answer: in my college, most courses are mandatory, so I must take them even if I've mastered the content. This course is one of those mandatorycourses.</p></li>

"Ph.D. work seems like a drag sometimes, is this normal?","<p>I am a math researcher working in number theory. During my college years I heard all the stories of great mathematicians, icons of the subject who dedicated most of their time to mathematics research (think Gauss, Euler etc). And that motivated me. I always seemed to do well in math at college. I secured top ranks at  graduate and undergraduate exams. I cleared the national entrance exam in mathematics (CSIR, India) and got admitted into a Ph.D. programme. Now that I'm pursuing a Ph.D things are not as I had envisioned. There are days where I just don't feel like it. Some parts of math are hard and it seems like a drag. Also I conduct classes thrice a week which I am not enthusiastic about and on some days I just don't wanna do it. </p>

<p>I have this idea of a perfect job where you come in to work everyday and are captivated by what you do and everything just flows. But that's not what I am experiencing. Is this normal? I’m confused. Its not like I have lost interest  rather that I'm not as in to it as I would like to be. </p>
",88208,18-04-2017 11:50,How should I deal with becoming discouraged as a graduate student?,"<p>I am a third year (starting fourth year in the fall) PhD student in mathematics. I've passed all qualifying exams and am currently doing research. As far as I can tell, I am not doing poorly. I have the good fortune of having a great advisor, being in a very supportive department, and having friends and family who genuinely care about my success. </p>

<p>The fact is research is hard. It appears to consist primarily of staring at a problem for days and days and days without getting anywhere. Sometimes, rarely, I do figure something out and that feels wonderful, but the overwhelming majority of my time appears to be spent banging my head against a mostly figurative wall. I am not complaining about the material being hard, and I am not averse to putting in hard work, but I get frequently discouraged when I realize the vast volumes of mathematics that I yet know nothing about (and probably never will). It's very hard to quantify progress - in particular, there are too few tangible returns after too many hours worked. I find myself thinking along the lines of ""Oh, if only someone actually smart were thinking about this problem they would have solved it in moments"" and so on. </p>

<p>I've talked about this to some number of people; here is some advice I have received:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take a day off. Putting in hours upon hours of trying things doesn't magically lead to a solution, particularly if the brain is tired and just wants to sleep.</li>
<li>Have a hobby. Since math research doesn't exactly provide instant gratification, a hobby might provide some instead. </li>
<li>Talk to other graduate students. Realize that many graduate students go through this.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm interested to know how other folks have dealt with being discouraged as a graduate student. Does it get better with time and experience? Is this a sign that research is not for me and that I should seriously consider a life outside academia?</p>

<p>Up until now when I was working on papers, I usually wrote all my thoughts into the corresponding sections of the papers. However, with my dissertation as a ""larger paper"", I don't think it's feasible to organize my thoughts this way.</p>

<p>How do you organize 100+ ""small thoughts"" about your research and still have a good overview? I know that I can use a physical notebook but I'd rather have an online solution that allows me to quickly reorganize my thoughts (which a notebook does not).</p>

<p>I know that <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/83/good-practices-for-organizing-notes"">Good practices for organizing notes</a> is related but the answers were discussing online vs. offline and the general guideline was 'whatever helps you'.</p>

<p>Most of them are useful only for a short amount of time, but some may be important for much longer (when writing a paper, or when having new ideas to continue a once abandoned project). Typically I work on a few project simultaneously.</p>

<p>Writing on single sheets (even if adding date and title) makes it easy to organize by topic, but also easy to loose. Keeping in one notepad makes it harder to collect useful things of one topic in one place.</p>

How to list an unfinished PhD on a resume,"<p>I started studying my PhD with a federal scholarship that was supposed to sustain all my expenses and allow me to study without the need to work. Long story short, between family and mortgage payments money was scarce. My relatives helped with some of the expenses, but after 2.5 years, there were just too many pressure from financial problems, and I was not having a good progress in my investigation, that my advisor and I decided to suspend the PhD and that I should focus on getting a job.</p>

<p>To that extent, is it a good idea to emphasize that I started a PhD but was not able to finish it, or will it create a bad image about me not ending what I start? Should I wait until they ask what I did for those 3 years to tell them I didn't finish it? The PhD is in my CV, as started but not finished. Should I keep it that way or should I erase it?</p>

"Are German ""Dr.med."" and USA PhD equivalent?","<p>Where can I find information if the german Dr.med. is corresponding to the USA PhD? Did anyone with Dr.med. apply for USA PhD equivalent?</p>

<p>Thanks for the comments.
<strong>Actually I don’t really think this has been answered</strong> here. I read the mentioned topics and they don't answer my question.
MD in USA is a title students get after finishing medical school. In Germany this turns you in a Physician, but you don't have the title ""Dr.med."" 
To earn the title you have to write and defend a doctoral thesis. That's why MD in US and Dr. med. in Germany are not the same.</p>

führen.”</p>

<p>This is what I find on <em>Wikipedia</em>, but I hesitate to huse this as my only source:</p>

<p>""There are a variety of doctoral degrees, with the most common being the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), which is awarded in many different fields, ranging from the humanities to the scientific disciplines. There are also some doctorates in the US, such as ... Doctor of Medicine (MD) ..., which are generally regarded internationally as professional degrees rather than doctorates, as they are not research degrees and no defense of any dissertation or thesis is performed.
...</p>

<p>...Doctorate degrees in Germany are research doctorates and are awarded via a process called Promotion (""promotion""). The concept of a US-style professional doctorate as an entry-level professional qualification does not exist.
...</p>

<p>...In German-speaking nations; most Eastern European nations..., the corresponding degree to a Doctor of Philosophy is simply called ""Doctor"" (Doktor), and the subject area is distinguished by a Latin suffix (e.g., ""Dr. med."" for Doctor medicinae, ...).""</p>

"How to deal with rote ""publication shopping""?","<p>I spend a lot of time peer-reviewing paper submissions to conferences, workshops, and journals in my field.  Sometimes I end up getting assigned a paper that I had already rejected from another venue.  Usually the authors of the resubmission have at least attempted to address the flaws pointed out in the past reviews. But sometimes the paper is submitted in much the same form. That is, the authors have failed to correct the major errors and gaps identified and agreed upon by the reviewers. They may not even have bothered to fix simple mistakes such as typos (even when the reviewers helpfully itemized these).  It seems that these authors have no understanding of or respect for the peer review process.  Rather, they are adopting a rapid-fire approach of submitting the same paper to different venues in sequence (or in parallel, for all I know) until they luck out on a suitably unqualified or neglectful reviewing panel that happens to clear it for publication.</p>

<p>What I normally do when I receive such a resubmission is to copy, paste, and resubmit my previous review.  After all, if the authors haven't bothered revising their paper, why should I spend any extra time re-evaluating it?  But I wonder if that's <em>all</em> I should be doing.  Does it make any sense to alert the journal editors/area chairs about these time-wasting shenanigans?  Do serial ""publication shoppers"" ever get blacklisted, or at least a stern talking-to?  Or is dealing with the same submissions over and over again just an inevitable and unmitigatable part of the whole peer review process?</p>
",89239,09-05-2017 14:51,"Asked again to review a paper, when the authors don't wish to modify it","<p>I have received a manuscript to review for a journal. The interesting thing is, I had already reviewed this article (exact same title, abstract and author list, almost exact same content) for <em>another</em> journal a few weeks ago where I recommended that it be published, but only after major revisions of both form and content. When I first reviewed it, I wrote a two-page review, listing some questions and several “actionable” comments, ranging from some concerns about exactness of the text (some conclusions didn't seem fully backed by the results) all the way down to trivial stuff (grammar, a few typos, graphic issues with the figures, etc.).</p>

<p>Now, the manuscript has come to me for review again, but it is almost unchanged from the first version. None of the serious stuff has been addressed, and even most of the trivial stuff was not fixed (there's at least one remaining typo, and the figures still aren't fully legible). However, I think this behavior from the authors is clearly a bad signal, which should be somehow conveyed to the editor: they're not willing to amend their work, and would rather do some journal-shopping.</p>

<p>What would you suggest me to do? Should I just re-send my earlier review? Add a note to the editor about my knowledge of the “history” of the paper? Or maybe even include it in my review, so the authors are aware that people know of their behavior, and maybe feel bad enough to change their ways?</p>

How should I properly cite an author with a variously credited name?,"<p>I have recently been dealing with an interesting conundrum.  I have several papers written by the same author, but in which the author's name is credited differently.</p>

<p>Some of these articles credit this author as:</p>

<p>Schön, with an umlaut.</p>

<p>Schoen, where the name is written according to the convention of adding ""e"", where an umlaut cannot be typed.</p>

<p>My citation style would ordinarily place a ---- under duplicate articles by one author, but the typographical variation in the credited names in the journal means that a reader of my references, who has not verified as I have that these articles are by the same person, might have the impression I was citing two different authors.  Equally, I worry that it would be quite inappropriate to alter the style in which the author's name was printed in the original journal.  Is there anyway I can indicate in my references that these are articles by the same person? </p>

<p>Now suppose that I want to cite three works by the same author: one published in French in one spelling (call it SP1), another in English in another spelling SP2, and the third was published only in his native language (the correct transliteration of the name, according to the current rules, would be SP3).</p>

<p>What is the common practice in this case?</p>

<p>If I preserve the historical spelling of these articles, then it seems that they were written by three different authors.</p>

<p>If I choose one spelling for all three references (I'm tempted to choose SP3), then it historically inaccurate and could lead to problems with finding the referenced article (not all search engines use flexible enough to take into account different spellings).</p>

What does referee mean in The Computer Journal?,"<p>In The Computer Journal I was looking at the <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/comjnl/pages/Manuscript_Preparation_Submission"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Instruction to authors</a> page, I did not understand the below instruction-</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Authors should supply a list of between three and five referees who
  would be suitable to referee the paper. Please enclose full name,
  email and full postal addresses.</p>

<p>I thought after paper submission, the editors will review it &amp; recommend if there any changes are necessary. But according to above instruction it seems that author has to provide suitable referee list. Then editors will review submitted paper.</p>

Peer review for the lay person,"<p>I anticipate a lot of scepticism about my question, but I've written a short paper which identifies and corrects what I believe to be a flaw in the way an age old Newtonian problem is taught in physics.

For instance, you have solved a very important open problem. However, you are not known in the field and do not have any remarkable publications. Your supervisor thinks the work is good and you submit the work to a high profile journal, but you get rejected.</p>

<p>The thing is that the contribution is very strong. It breaks what most people believe or what they have already proven: e.g., you solve the P vs. NP problem or any other well known open problem. </p>

<ul>
<li>""The proof must be wrong."" </li>
<li>""You cannot achieve such a result."" </li>
<li>""You do not understand well the notion of ...""</li>

What are the pros and cons of well compensated STEM graduate students joining a union?,"<p>Recently, my state has declared graduate students as employees giving them the right to unionize. The students in the Engineering School are very well compensated. The benefits that we get are</p>

<ol>
<li>Minimum stipend of 29k$ (which was increased ~3 years ago). </li>
<li>Top tier health insurance plan fully paid for by the University and Engineering School</li>
<li>Deans that largely respect student needs and actively address current issues</li>
<li>Plethora of funding for student lead activities </li>
<li>Free services like legal council, psychiatrist, campus clinique, campus shuttle buses, etc.</li>
<li>TA opportunities are always available for those that need them. </li>
</ol>

<p>Additionally, my department has a very high standard set forth for us. We have nice offices, the Chair actively addresses our concerns and complaints, funds for student activities and community building, computational resources, and more. The quality of life for students in my department (Applied Math) is quite high. </p>

<p>Lately, we've had outside people dropping by to advise us to join a union. The humanities students are largely in support of this movement since they are not compensated as well as the engineering students. In my point of view, there are very few reasons why I can see joining a union will benefit the Applied Math graduate students. Given how well we, the graduate students in my department, are currently treated, what are the advantages and disadvantages of unionization? </p>

<p>Edit: There is a similar question <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/20531/what-are-the-benefits-detriments-to-graduate-students-joining-unions"">here</a>, however, does not specifically address STEM students. </p>

<p>I am a naive graduate student and will like to be better informed about the advantages and repercussions of joining a union. Whenever administrative University personnel have approached us to dissuade the effort, their tone has been extremely diplomatic and ambiguous about why they are advising against unionizing.</p>

<p>A brief summary of the responses is as follows.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Advantages of unionizing</p>

<ul>
<li>Security of current benefits</li>
<li>Bargaining power to timely address current, new, and growing needs of the entire bargaining unit </li>
<li>Guaranteed minimum pay </li>
<li>Improving circumstances of students in other schools who are not as well compensated</li>
<li>Human resources like representation for students facing abuse, harassment, or other adversities from their advisors</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Disadvantages of unionizing </p>

<ul>
<li>Partisan representation </li>
<li>Clarifying the distinction between student and employee (though some may argue that this is an advantage)</li>
<li>Paying dues (though contracts usually negotiate higher stipends to offset this amount)</li>
<li>Deterioration of student/administrative relationship</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Additional STEM specific points that I'd like to add are</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Advantages</p>

<ul>
<li>Incentives to address issues such as a single student having to monitor experiments running for 8+ hours</li>
<li>For international students, alleviating fears of not being able to find an advisor which prevents them for settling to the 1st person that says yes regardless of their interest </li>
<li>Some departments in the Engineering school offer things like funds for all students in their 3rd year to purchase a new laptop. Adapting this or similar policies universally would be appreciated.</li>
<li>Guaranteed funding beyond X years as set forth by the School, especially when the average is just slightly below X. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Disadvantages </p>

<ul>
<li>As funds are rerouted into increased stipends, there may be 

<ul>
<li>Decreased support for professional development (conferences, workshops, etc.)</li>
<li>Decreased supplemental resources (rented compute nodes and hours, new lab equipment, etc.)</li>
<li>Fewer graduate student and postdoc hires</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

"In a camera ready paper (has been accepted), how to cite my own paper that is still under blind review?","<p>Please Note I am asking how to cite a paper under blind-reviewed in <strong>an accepted paper, NOT a new paper to be submitted.</strong> </p>

<p>Chronologically,</p>

<ul>
<li>First, I submitted paper A that requires double-blind review. </li>
<li>Then, I cite it in another paper B. (In paper B, I explained that paper A is not available since it is under a double-blind review process)</li>
<li>Paper B is accepted while paper A is still under review.</li>
<li>Now I have to submit the camera ready version of Paper B before the notification of Paper A.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Solution I</strong></p>

<p>Put my blind review article into a pre-print archive (e.g. arXiv) so that it can be available for citing. But, would it ""spoil"" the blind review process?</p>

<p><strong>Solution II</strong></p>

<p>place an anonymized version of paper A in a dropbox folder and cite it with a link to that dropbox file in the reference.

",90356,02-06-2017 12:32,Citing an article under a double-blind review process,"<p>This is my case: I've recently co-authored and sent an article to a journal that follows a double-blind review process, so that reviewers shouldn't be able to know the name of the authors. ---I mean, I (as the corresponding author) am responsible for hiding any authoring information to them.</p>

<p>Now I am writing another paper and I want to cite the article that is under double-blind review.</p>

<p>So, it is not only that I should add the typical <em>""under review""</em> label when citing that article, but moreover I can't give any information about the article that may <em>spoil</em> the double-blind process. For instance, if I add the name of the authors and the name of the journal it was sent to, then I can't include the title of the article (because it could happen that the citing article is sent for reviewing to one of the blind reviewers of the first article, or that it is even published before the first one...).</p>

<p>Anyway... <strong>How can/should I cite an article that is under review by a journal that follows a double-blind review process without potentially revealing too much information?? How is this problem usually solved?</strong></p>

<p>I must say that I usually publish pre-prints as technical reports, but I didn't do it this time, in order not to reveal any information that could be accessed by the blind reviewers.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I was thinking about putting this label instead of the title of the cited article: <em>""[Title is omitted to protect the double-blind review process]""</em>. But I still have some doubts. If I mention the name of the journal it was sent to, could the article be potentially recognized by the blind reviewers?</p>

I have quite good achievements (1-year scholarship in Japan, ambassador program for a big NGO, few wins or good places in the contests etc). I am also waiting for publishing my first research paper and plan to do 2 more untill I will graduate. </p>

<p>There is one problem though. My GPA is not very good. It's a combination of 3 varriables. First, on the beggining of my studies I planned to go to bussiness rather then academic work. Second I have a mild/average form of brittle bone disease which result of having to take 3 years of medical leave (not at once). And sometimes in cases when the injury was not to bad (for example 2-3 months) i tried to make up the classes and I left deciding that i rather not lose another year and pass on B- or C then to go the other way. Third factor is the fact that going from economics to very math-based field as statistics and econometrics is not easy. I am managing this but with having to make up the material from bachelor's in this field it's rather B on average then straight A. </p>

<p>How will a researcher know where to publish his PhD so that he can get a Post-Doc or faculty position?</p>

<p>If a candidate does not understand which journal is good/average/bad,how will one decide where to publish?</p>

<p>It was accepted two days after we submitted it. That's too fast. We were suspicious. Although the journal said that all papers are peer-reviewed, we could not see how that was done in two days.

I love pure math but detest teaching. What non-academic options do I have after finishing a PhD in Complex Algebraic Geometry?,"<p>I love pure math and currently I am at a very low ranked US math PhD programme. My area is Complex and Algebraic Geometry which I love it. But, after some semesters of being a TA, I realized that I detest teaching. Repeating and repeating again. And furthermore, having to deal with those annoying undergrads is horrible.</p>

<p>I really love my research subject, but since I am in a very low ranked US PhD programme at an unknown state university, with probability zero I will get a research job or even a postdoc. What non-academic options do I have after finishing? I do not mind going back to my homecountry, but the only alternatives I have there(Latin America) are working in a Bakery again, which I did during my undergrad, or sell drugs or being a smuggler. I will not even get a faculty position because I detest teaching and my PhD school is very low ranked. I could not get into a math PhD programme in my country nor Spain nor Brazil, so I got into my actual PhD school.</p>

<p>What should I do? Any advice besides learning programming or finance, well I may not have enough time since in my programme all TAs are overloded with work. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>The only reason I remain is for my own self esteem mostly and because I love pure maths; otherwise I would quit. Having said that, I have no issues selling drugs, it is just not to hurt my grandmother, who raised me, that I am looking for an alternative. She made a lot of effort and worked hard so I could finish High school. But I would do anything for not ending up as a lecturer in a crappy community college or another unknown state U or U in my country.</p>

I found some novel findings in my paper and so far it has been well received but I keep thinking ""I'm proposing a a new thing that hasnt been seen in the field, what if it was a fluke and can't be repeated and I end up losing my career in science.""

<p>Beyond the obvious reason that this is something I have struggled with for many years and only recently gotten a handle on myself, there's also some evidence that merely realizing that other people experience imposter syndrome helps fellow imposters.

The first one is a short paper and the second one is a full paper. After 7 months the short paper and after 8 month the full paper got major revision. For the short paper I submitted the revised paper after 5 months. Finally, this paper got rejected after 7 months after I submitted the revision. Therefore it was under review for (7+5+7) months i.e. around 1.5 yr including the time I took for revising the paper. For the second paper I submitted the revised paper after 5 months. After this 5 months have passed. Therefore it is under review for (8+5+5) months i.e. 1.5 year. Will it be ok if I politely ask the editor about the acceptance chance of the full paper. One week back I asked the editor, he told me that they are waiting for one review. After that they will send the decision. Is it ok to request the editor whether he can confirm its acceptance chance ? If they want to reject reject now only, so that I can send to other journals. I will be applying for some jobs now.

I have somehow completed my PhD without having the required theoretical understanding of my field. Can I have an academic career?,"<p>I have an undergrad in mechanical engineering. My Masters, PhD was in Mechanical too. However, I have never been academically strong (grades were majorly C and B+). I had to retake advanced mathematics, continuum mechanics and Finite element analysis course during my undergrad as I had flunked the courses.</p>

<p>However, I always enjoyed the field of computational mechanics, how materials behave is something I enjoy thinking about. I pursued the field in my Masters and PhD, inspite of not taking any grad level course during the programmes. My committee never instructed me to take the courses, I thought self study would suffice.</p>

<p>I have a PhD in application of computational mechanics, I have 3 first authored papers in materials science journals, not mathematics intensive journals. I am worried about my future in the field.
I am continuing with a postdoc under my PhD advisor for a year and am searching for other positions.</p>

<p>I shouldn't have pursued higher studies, atleast not in a field I have theoretical deficiency. I still love my field, but I am still afraid of the theoretical papers in my field. My work (application focused) is not mathematically intensive and is pretty straightforward. I can argue that given a direction, one doesn't need a masters or PhD to do what I do.</p>

<p>I know, there won't be anyone who had experiences similar to mine. It is always expected that people go for highers studies in subjects they are good in. I did the other way round. What should be my course of action now to have a potential academic career? I think I am up for a dissappointing career outcome, but still I want to give it a try.</p>

Whatever theory I know about them is through self study and through work experience. I understand the concepts of the methods, but I never got a chance to have a formal course with exams and assignments on the subjects. So, my self study hasn't been very meticulous.</p>

<p>Now, I feel like a charlatan, and don't feel like I deserve a PhD degree. I am also feeling lost and like a loser. Saddest thing is that, I passed all my qualifiers, proposals and no one questioned my abilities. </p>

Why do some journals ask if there is someone who you do not wish to use as a referee?,"<p>I have noticed that sometimes when you submit an article to a journal it will ask if there is someone in particular who you do not want to referee the paper.</p>

<p>I was wondering what the reason for this option was.  Is it simply to avoid a conflict of interest or if you really do not get on with the person to the point where you do not wish them to review something you have written?  If you put someone down as someone you do not want to be a referee, will the journal think you are scared of that person's critical appraisal of the document and actually send it to that person or will they genuinely avoid sending it to that person for review?</p>

How to Interpret This Response to a LOR Request,"<p>As I mentioned in my last post, I experienced a lot of stress during my last undergraduate semester as well as an episode of depression due to my professor's upcoming retirement. (I deeply admired her and wanted her to be my graduate advisor.) Honestly, I think the depression affected me even more than the stress, but I couldn't tell her about it at the time. She had taught me a total of 2 semesters, and I thought we had a good rapport. When I asked to be in her graduate level course toward the end of my  first class with her, she enthusiastically replied ""..You have been a terrific student this summer and it would be my pleasure to continue working with you...""  I also asked about a letter of recommendation when I had written to her, and she said that we could discuss it the next semester but ""given your excellent work so far, I am inclined to write.""</p>

<p>Fast forward to that semester, and a lot happened that I feel affected the quality of my work. First, I spent nearly half the semester moving every few days (she knew about the situation), and that gave me a late start on the research paper. However, my housing stabilized mid-semester, which still gave me ample time to produce quality work. Later in the semester, however, when I asked her to be my graduate advisor, she met with me to explain that she was in the process of retiring and not taking on new students. (She was also living out of state.) This news of her not being in my life anymore after that semester caused me to have a mental breakdown, and I lost a lot of my motivation and had difficulty concentrating on the research paper. Additionally, I decided to change topics just a couple of weeks before it was due. (I don't even know why I did this, it was just part of my breakdown/reaction.) </p>

<p>I received  an A in the course and an A- on the paper, but it was the sloppiest paper ever written and the writing was horrible. Had I graded a paper like that, I would have given it no more than a C-. She probably did take my housing situation into consideration with the grade, but I don't feel that sufficiently explains such poor quality work. (Again, I couldn't tell her that I was depressed because she was retiring.) So, from her perspective, I might just not have been cut out for graduate school, at least that's what I worried that she thought. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, I emailed her after the semester asking her if I could still use her as a job reference and asked if I could ""contact her in the future"" for a letter of recommendation for grad. school. I figured that she would be less likely to decline to be a job reference, so I deliberately coupled these requests. I also mentioned being inspired by her work etc., but it probably sounded insincere. It wasn't, though, honestly, I don't think I could have handled her declining the lor because of how much I admired her. (So I admittedly made it difficult for her to directly decline.) Anyway, she responded right away (wishing me a Happy New Year) and saying that I could still use her as a job reference and ""contact her in the future re: grad. school applications."" However,given her previous enthusiasm when I asked to be in the grad. level course, I perceived this as a hint that she wouldn't write the letter. She also signed this letter with ""Sincerely"" instead of ""Best"" or something similar, which further confirmed my impression. </p>

<p>Having an anxiety disorder, I sometimes read a lot into nothing, as I'm always anticipating the worst. However, given the quality of my paper, I don't know...So I wanted to ask how others would interpret her response. Does it sound like my initial thoughts were probably right? Alternatively, does it seem like she may have written a weak letter, the kind that says you're not recommending the student? Or, does it sound like I indeed read too much into everything and ruined our good rapport? </p>

<p>In retrospect, I should have sent another email directly asking if she felt comfortable writing a supportive letter of recommendation and explained that I would understand if she didn't. However, having permission to ""contact her in the future,"" I instead submitted a proposal (in an area I had no background in) to a conference she was attending, and the rest is history.(see previous post) </p>
",149611,26-05-2020 03:52,How Would You React If a Student Complained to the Dept. Chair About You but Later Apologized and Disclosed Mental Illness?,"<p>After experiencing a lot of stress during my last undergrad. semester (and an episode of depression caused by my favorite professor declining to be my grad. advisor due to retirement), I worried that she didn't see me as graduate school material. (I received an A in her grad. level course but my final paper, I felt, was poorly written.) So, hoping to impress her, I submitted a proposal to a conference I knew she was attending, and it was accepted. Afterward, I emailed her asking for minor assistance with the project, but I perceived her response (obviously declining) as &quot;curt.&quot; (I had no background in this area, submitted the proposal before beginning the project, and this was the first proposal I'd ever submitted to a conference.)</p>
<p>My anxiety disorder was out of control during this time, and I concluded that she was either angry at me for an unrelated reason (i.e. maybe I had spoken to a faculty member she didn't like etc.) or had simply &quot;devalued&quot; me after that paper. (I had thought we had a good rapport during the 2 semesters she taught me.) At that point I just wanted reassurance that our rapport was intact, so I emailed her a few days later, offering to withdraw the proposal but still asking for her assistance (explaining that I wanted to show her that I could produce better work when not under stress). When she didn't respond to this email within in 24 hrs. like she usually did, I &quot;freaked out&quot; and wrote to the Department Chair complaining not only about the unanswered email but also about her &quot;tone&quot; causing me anxiety on a few occasions.</p>
<p>The Chair told me (by email, never bothered to meet with me) that my &quot;grievances were being formally recorded&quot; and that he was meeting with the dean to discuss the situation etc. He also asked the professor to respond to the unanswered email, where she more gently declined to help with the project. However, we never had the chance to have a conversation and work out any misunderstandings. For example, I wanted to know if she was upset with me for any reason and if she was comfortable writing me a lor after my research paper etc.</p>
<p>I later met with the dean to explain that my anxiety disorder was out of control when I had written to the chair, and she said that she had spoken to the professor, knew she wasn't upset with me, and even seemed inclined to write a letter of recommendation etc. Thus, after that conversation, I decided to email the professor to apologize and mentioned having GAD, but because of the Dean's reassurances, I also included a lor request. The professor, however, did not respond. (Including the lor request probably made my apology seem insincere, and the letter looked more like an attempt at excusing poor work than a sincere apology). I then went to every level of administration, explaining that I had written to the chair during an acute mental health episode and wanted the grievance dismissed (and the chance to sincerely apologize to the prof.) but no one would reach out to her. Instead, I was told that &quot;she was not obligated to respond to me but that I shouldn't take her lack of response as a sign of &quot;ill will.&quot; Long story short, after continuously trying to have the grievance dismissed, the university sent me a cease and desist letter, which seems to be functioning as a no contact order, as it prohibits me from communicating with anyone except the General Counsel's office.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, I could understand a professor resenting a student who complained the department chair/dean, but my behavior was caused by a mental health condition, and I was genuinely remorseful and did everything I could to rectify the situation. So, I want to ask how you'd react if a student or former student (whom you previously liked) filed a complaint during an episode of mental illness and later tried to have it dismissed? Would you forgive them or cut contact with them? Even if you forgave them, would you write them a letter of recommendation if their work was good? (My apology is sincere but I sometimes worry that she didn't respond because she was unimpressed with my work.) Alternatively, are professors typically advised against communicating with a student who brings a complaint against them, even if they try to retract it (i.e. to avoid legal liability)?</p>
<p>*The professor was living out of state during this time, so I couldn't schedule a visit during office hours to discuss the project/the letter etc. Email was our only means of communication.</p>

Do I Have a Shot at Graduate School? (Master's Program/Humanities Field),"<p>While I graduated with a relatively high undergraduate GPA (3.93), I don't have any publications, research experience, or strong (maybe any) letters of recommendation. In context, even my GPA isn't impressive because I never took more than 12 credits per semester (sometimes less) and didn't work or have any outside commitments during undergrad. (The light course load was mostly due to financial constraints.) </p>

<p>I haven't taken the GRE yet, but would a high score offset an otherwise weak application? (I know it's probably difficult to obtain such score, but it may be my only hope.)</p>

<p>There's also the problem of letters of recommendation. Most schools won't even process applications without letters of recommendation, and mine would be weak at best. (I might have one good one but it it's in a different field.)  Additionally, as already mentioned, I have a cease and desist letter from the university prohibiting me from communicating with anyone except their Assistant General Counsel, so she would have to email the professors on my behalf (a red flag in itself). This was because of my adamant attempts to have a grievance against one of my professors, written in a state of mental illness, dismissed. All faculty know about the situation because they've been instructed to report any communication from me to her (the assistant general counsel). This may not hurt me, however, because I was only trying to rectify a mistake and prevent my professor from suffering. I'm more worried about my application from an academic standpoint. </p>

<p>So given, this information, do I have a path to graduate school? I see students with lower GPAs get acceptances, but they usually have something that stands out on their application (i.e. publications, stellar letters of recommendations praising their research ability etc.). Again, my current goal is a master's degree in the humanities (I'm reluctant to reveal the field to protect my professor's privacy), and I'm not at all concerned about rank or prestige. Location is the most important factor for me, as I didn't even want to leave my current city, but given all the negativity I've experienced at my university, it would be a toxic environment. </p>

So, I can't ignore the possibility that this is the reason. Is it normal apply for postodc positions without officially defending your thesis?  </p>

<p>Although I think I may be close to submitting by then, it may take longer. Is it worth applying for postdoc positions or would universities not consider you until you have completed the PhD? I assume that the pass rates of PhDs are very high if the candidate has got to the submission stage. </p>

<p>Edit: This question is aimed at the people that are are the submission stage but haven't yet defended their thesis. It is not a question asking if I can get a post-doc without a PhD. </p>

Should I hide certain education history on my CV/resume?,"<p>Apologize in advance if it is not suitable for this site. I consider asking this in workplace exchange, but I think people on this site are more familiar with similar situation. For obvious reasons I open a new account to keep myself anonymous.</p>

<p>I am a last year Ph.D. student that will almost exclusively apply for industry jobs in the near future, and I have earned a master degree during my 2nd year in the program (FYI: In US people in Ph.D. program sometime obtain a master degree in the middle of the process, after passing some requirements). In other words, if I finish Ph.D. in the current program I will have a bachelor degree, a master degree and a Ph.D. degree just from the current institution and my undergraduate institution.</p>

<p>Many years ago, before entering the current program, I had another master degree in a different field that is the product of Ph.D. drop out (where, at least from my point of view, is due to getting abused/bullied. I burned the bridge on my way out, due to my attempt to report &amp; confront.).</p>

<p>In this situation, does it make sense to omit that master degree on my resume, given that it looks somewhat weird and in most cases unrelated to the jobs I apply for right now and in the near future? The only reason I still include it is to seal the time gap on the resume, but I am afraid there is a little risk of people asking for references from the program I dropped out from (on my transcript it is stated PhD: discontinued). I am not sure if omitting and (if necessary) explaining the time gap could be a better strategy for the purpose of industry job applications than including and (if necessary) explaining the switch field (I'm not worry about explaining why new program fit my goal better, but worry about getting bad references).</p>

<p>Thanks for your answers in advance.</p>
",149677,27-05-2020 10:54,Should one list incomplete degrees on a CV?,"<p>When applying for jobs after my PhD, should my CV include an incomplete degree I read towards years ago? It's a field completely unrelated to what I'm doing now. However, before my final year when I started getting sups and failures by the dozen (my reason for quitting) things actually went swimmingly. I worked with a renowned professor as an undergrad research assistant for a spell and even published a paper (on my own) during that phase of my academic journey. I didn't get a certificate out of it, but I nevertheless feel I honed some valuabe skills then (and of course I have a transcript listing the passes and failures).</p>

<p>I have since moved onto a completely unrelated humanities field. Should I mention the incomplete degree on my CV? If I ignore it, prospective employers might wonder what I did for three years of my life, surely? Should I list my science publication on my CV when it is irrelevant to what I'm doing now? Does quitting and switching tracks make me look flighty?</p>

How to handle coauthor not confirm authorship for publication,"<p>Currently I have a publication that waiting for co-authors to confirm their authorship, but they never respond. What is the best way to handle it? Will journal assume they give up their authorship after a time period like 1/2 months?</p>

<p>Background:
The are PIs for a study generated data like 8 years ago, I used the data to do analysis and got a publication. I tried to contact them multiple times but they never respond me. I already waited from submission to accept, which is 4 months already. </p>
",149728,28-05-2020 13:02,Is it ethical to submit a paper with the name of a co-author who cannot be contacted?,"<p>The paper in question is based on research my collaborator X and I did together some months ago. Our respective contributions to the research were around 2/3 for X and 1/3 for me. In terms of the actual text of the paper, X wrote about 1/3 and I wrote about 2/3. </p>

<p>During the writing of the actual paper, X decided to leave academia. I can no longer contact X: emails to the old address go undelivered and there is no forwarding address for physical mail. Attempts to find X through web searches and contact X through mutual acquaintances have been unsuccessful. X has thus not seen a complete draft of the paper, only the sections that were actually written by X.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, is it ethical for me to submit a paper with X's name on it, without a complete version having been checked by X and without X's approval?</p>

<p>If I do submit it, should it contain a note of the fact that X was unable to check the completed paper? I am considering the hypothetical possibility that I could have inadvertently introduced an error while writing the complete paper (and such an error might survive through peer-review and into publication); responsibility for such an error should be mine alone. </p>

<p>There is no possibility of separating out my contribution into a separate paper. Either the work has to be published as a whole or not at all.</p>

<p>I am in a field where alphabetical listing of authors is standard, so there is no question of the order of authors.</p>

How Much Weight does a Conference Paper carry compared to a Journal Publication?,"<p>I am working on some stuff for a paper.  I have recently seen an advert for a conference calling for papers and I feel like I currently have enough stuff that I could submit it to this conference and get it published.</p>

<p>However, it looks as if the paper would be published in the 'conference proceedings' as part of a series by Springer.  Does this mean that the publication would only be classed as a 'conference paper' and do conference papers really carry the same weight as journal publications?   (It's worth mentioning that the paper would be peer-reviwed if I sent it for the proceedings of this conference). If not, my idea would be to wait until I have added more to what I am working on and then send it to a journal.</p>

<p>Edit: I am aware that there are other questions asking if a conference paper should be compared to a journal article.  I am asking if in this case the publication can be listed as a journal article as it will be peer-reviewed by experts and published in Communications in Computer and Information Science, so I am wondering if this allows a work-around for me to class it as one of my journal articles.  The link below provides more information: I would like to know if I can list it as a peer-reviewed journal paper or if I will have to call it a conference paper, as these are not the same to me.</p>

<p>Second edit: To make it clear the paper would be a physics paper on the subject of quantum mechanics and would only be published in CCIS as it represents a surprising application of a particular piece of computer software.  My issue is that I don't want to see the paper as a novelty item when I have been thinking about and working on the physics going into it for years.  The use of software in it is really just a matter of convenience as there is a bit where it it easier to use software to generate a numerical example illustrating the general theory I have been talking about in a concrete case.</p>

<p>Third edit: Turns out the publication could only be classed as a conference paper so I will add to what I have got and send it to a journal, as I don't regard a conference paper as being equivalent to a journal publication (or at least, not in physics).</p>

Should online notes be cited in reference of paper for publication?,"<p>I find that some lecture notes available online as well as some websites (e.g. wiki) provide important sources of information for various scientific fields (e.g. mathematics), and are sometimes better than officially published papers or books in certain senses. </p>

<p>My question is that if I write a paper for official publication, can I cite them in the reference of the paper? If so, what is the format to cite them? For examples, to cite an online lecture note, may I simply write as preprint, or have to add the weblink to the note? For web sources, may I add weblinks of the websites to be cited? </p>

<p>For example, is it valid to cite something like: ""P Schlicht. <em>Lecture Note: A Introduction to Model Theory</em>, Online...(or Preprint...), 2018""?

How to deal with systematic rigging of academic position job postings?,"<p>In a discussion with some of my close friends in other academic institutes, we noticed the common experience* in which it seems that well over 80% of the advertised job postings for permanent or tenure track positions at the departments close to our working environment where we are working are rigged or fixed. It seems that in Europe there are many people facing similar problems [1,2].</p>

<p>In this context ""rigged"" is meant to describe that many people at the involved institution already know who will get the position when or even before the position is publicly advertised. And with ""knowing"" it's meant that if it would be possible to place bets on the outcome, the people familiar with the situation (but not in the selection commission) would place all-in bets for the same person without any regard of the other candidates who applied.  </p>

<p>In some cases the job description was even tuned to match the CV of particular candidates. And sometimes, it's already known years ahead that a particular person will get that position. In some cases those persons are also well qualified for the job, but in many cases external candidates with better credentials were not objectively evaluated. The other candidates were invited for interviews, and talks, giving sample lectures, spending time energy and financial resources for their applications and traveling.</p>

<p>This practice seems unethical, but it seems so common that it seems to be an accepted norm. When I spoke with a professor about this, he thought it was perfectly normal to give the job to people who you know well, instead of someone who might seem to be qualified better but who you do not know well. From a risk management point of view he might be right. But to me the situation seems similar to people in the mafia, those people who are part of it do not consider it as a mafia, and they do not consider the activities to be unethical, they even consider it beneficial for the society. </p>

<p>*EDIT: Based on the answers in a similar question on a particular instance [3], it seems that many people are OK, with that this is how the things go, it has become part of academic culture. </p>

<p>But some aspects of the question stay open:</p>

<ul>
<li>How to deal with it in the search for a permanent faculty position? </li>
<li>How to find those job adverts which are really open?</li>
<li>How to deal with this if you are an insider and are observing this behavior on a regular basis?</li>
</ul>

<p>I gave department and campus tours to applicants, of who i knew they
had no chance, even if their credentials were better than that of some
of the professors in the selection commission. </p>

<ul>
<li>Should i have told them, that the whole vacancy and invitation for the interview was a charade? </li>
<li>If one notices such rigged position job advertisements in
its environment, should one report it somewhere? Where could such conduct be reported? </li>
</ul>

<p>Proof is not so much of an issue: We could easily set up a list of names and positions posting them on the web before the job was advertised get a time stamp. And confront some institute who cares with the statistics of hiring behavior. </p>

<p>But the most important central question is: </p>

<p><strong>What could be changed in the hiring procedures or rules to mitigate rigged job postings?</strong> </p>

<p>*These experiences are based on 7 people from various institutions in Europe (Germany, Italy, Spain, France) during the last 10 years. </p>

<p>EDIT: The associated question is definitely similar, but i think there are some fundamental differences. </p>

<ol>
<li>That question was about a single particular case this question is about systematic ongoing behavior with which I and my friends and many others [1,2] are dealing on a daily basis. </li>
<li>That question asks about a solution for a particular insider and potential whistleblower only. This question asks for solutions for insiders and outsiders (applicants). </li>

",149903,01-06-2020 11:10,I know that there is a preselected candidate for a position to be filled at my department. What should I do?,"<p>There is a rather attractive position to be filled at my department. The heads of department are already quite sure about who should fill this position. Jobs being filled with preselected candidates are not exactly legal, but common practice in my country. Thus, there legally has to be a job announcement, as everybody has to be given the chance to apply for the job. There further is an equal opportunities office that ensures that all candidates are being judged by the same categories and no one gets preferential treatment.</p>

<p>I never found this practice of preselecting candidates particularly fair or ethical, but let's just say that up until now I had to deal with other challenges. Then I recently stumbled across the list of applicants for that position by accident (was still lying in the printer) and saw that I know one of the applicants who apparently will have no chance against the preselected candidate. It's not that I desperately want this acquaintance (""friend"" is too much) to fill the job, but knowing a name on the ""you're never gonna get the job""-list made the unfair treatment so much more real. I don't find it acceptable.  </p>

<p><strong>Things that speak for me to do nothing:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Most importantly: My contract will be finished soon and I was, am and will be dependent on my boss's willingness to  give me a contract or rather (because there is no funding) her cooperation on further projects.</li>
<li>The head of department is my direct boss and (in my opinion) a very likeable person.</li>
<li>I highly appreciate her concern for her staff, she nevertheless needs to make strategic decisions at some points, which comes with the job and is only professional - I understand.</li>
<li>Furthermore, as much as I know the preselected candidate seems to be a very good, high impact candidate who will fit in the department.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Things that speak for me to do something</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Most importantly: It's a unfair/ unethical system and I don't want to stand by and watch</li>
<li>There is no funding for a future contract anyway (although my boss tried)</li>
<li>There may be many other candidates just as good or better than the preselected one</li>
</ul>

<p>What should I do? I'm not gonna lie: talking to my boss (head of department) scares me quite a bit. But then again I don't want to go to higher levels, be the whistleblower and ruin parts of my boss's career...</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>[Update]</strong><br>
Based on your answers I did/will do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>I talked to a colleague, turns out she had the same impression and wanted to talk to me about it as well. So concerning the question ""do you have proof?"": at least I have another witness now. But then again, as Anonymous Physicist wrote: up until now, no rule was broken. However, we decided to closely follow the application process in hope that our concerns were exaggerated (which I highly doubt)</li>
<li>""maybe it was just a statement about the quality of the candidate?"" It very much exceeded this, as my boss was talking about how important it is that they get the participant through the application process and what possible pitfalls could be. Nevertheless I'll talk to her in order to find out, what her behavior would look like if ""someone better"" shows up and if that'd be a case of nepotism (see answer of xLeitix).</li>

Can One Poorly Written Research Paper Derail Your Academic Future?,"<p>As mentioned in prior posts, I experienced a lot of stress and an episode of depression during my last undergraduate semester. The stress was caused by constant moving and housing insecurity for half the semester (giving me a late start on the paper) and the depression by learning of my professor being in the process of retirement/declining to be my graduate advisor. (I don't have clinical depression.) </p>

<p>I received an A- on a research paper in this class, but it was slipshod work, and (embarrassingly) probably one of the worst undergraduate papers ever written (written in a graduate level course no less). The worst part is that this happened with a professor I admired/loved, but from a practical standpoint, can this ruin my chances of graduate school? I've already graduated and can't afford to take more undergrad. courses. Even if I could, however, how would I get another professor to supervise my research when I've already produced poor work? </p>

<p>Has anyone been admitted to graduate school/succeeded in academia despite a poor research paper? For what it's worth, I'm finally rewriting it, but second chances seem rare in academia. </p>

<p>*I also experienced interpersonal conflict in the department, but my question is purely from an academic standpoint. </p>

<p>Edit- To get a better idea of the quality, here's the feedback I received on it: ""Gemini, Your final paper has a clear thesis, includes and utilizes a variety of primary and secondary sources, and is organized coherently. Given that this is your first attempt at using ____ Style  formatting, I attach a short summary of how to cite footnotes and create a bibliography. If you decide to do more with this paper in the future, you also would want to provide complete citation information for every note; correct numerous misspellings; and fix other common errors throughout."" She also said that I received 28/30 points--a very good result. I interpreted this latter part ""a very good result"" as indicating that she was lenient with the grade (which I appreciated, but I wanted to impress her).  </p>

<p>I know how neurotic/psychotic it must sound describing an A- as one of the worst papers ever written, but this really was horrible work, especially compared to the award-winning dissertation that one of her grad. students wrote.  Although it was written during a nervous breakdown (and in around a week's time frame), the circumstances, I worry, mattered less than the results. (Everyone has a reason why their work turns out poorly, but in the end, poor work is poor work.) </p>

<p>*This course was in the specific sub-field/research area that I want to study in grad. school. Normally students perform their best in the favorite classes, but I didn't take the news of her retirement/absence from my life well. </p>

<p>I want to add that if it's unethical to share her feedback, I'll delete it. I only wanted to provide an honest assessment of the quality, and without sharing the entire paper, I wasn't sure how else to do that. </p>

<p>Edit- this isn't a duplicate of <em>How does the admissions process work for Ph.D. programs in the US, particularly for weak or borderline students?</em> because that question doesn't address research. My question was more about getting second chances after mistakes/screw ups than the admission process itself. As such, I'm asking for my post to be reopened. </p>

Trying to volunteer as a research assistant post-Master's and not having any success so far,"<p>I'm an MS in CompSci grad who wants to do a PhD someday. The one thing I don't have from my time in undergrad and MS is significant research experience. Of course, I did undergrad research but was never published in any papers.

",150007,03-06-2020 15:42,Taking a break from industry and becoming an unpaid research assistant (or atleast getting involved in reserach at a school),"<p>I am planning to take a break from industry (software) and want to work under a professor/lab on a research project for 3-6 months, computer science/computing related. I was wondering if people could give me some advice on how to go about achieving this arrangement - success tips, what not to do and the feasibility of this whole endeavour.</p>

<p>I'm in my late 20s. Went to a good UK school and got a decent GPA. I got what is known as an undergraduate masters (MEng), which for all intents and purposes is a BSc + MSc. I regret never undertaking a summer UROP placement while doing my undergrad. I've often wondered about doing a PhD (I kinda always thought I would) and this would be one way to get some kind of feel of what it might be like. Who knows maybe I will change my career and move into research.</p>

<p>I have some potential projects (though still a little vague) that I would like to work on, but I am also looking for existing projects that sound interesting to contribute to. My current plan is to reach out to professors that seem like a good fit with my research interests (by scouring their academic pages and published work). I'm yet to reach out to anyone. Actually that's a good question - would I have more luck joining an existing research project or proposing my own?</p>

<p>This potential opportunity is unlikely to happen again - I currently do not have too many responsibilities e.g. kids, a mortgage, etc. That and the window for me doing something like this is shrinking all the time. I want to make the most of it by going to go to what is considered a competitive school (not that I'm applying for a programme per se). </p>

<p>I also want to sample US university life (I have a degree from the UK), go to a new city and meet some new people. </p>

<p>What I hope works in my favour is I have the money to entirely fund myself - I've been working in the tech indusry for the last half decade. Hopefully this means I don't have to work within the confines of the academic calendar nor compete for funding. I am concerned about the legality of working for free - I have seen <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/18083/nonpaid-volunteering-position-in-a-lab"">Nonpaid, volunteering position in a lab</a>.</p>

<p>I understand what I am trying to do may be a little unorthodox, but if I was a professor, and there was an enthusiastic individual who has a decent academics and willing to give up 6 figures for a chance to work on something interesting to us both, then I'd like to meet them. Of course I'm nothing special and I could be a hindrance, but hopefully my work experience, previous academics and genuine interest abate these concerns. To academics reading this, imagine if it was you I contacted asking for this opportunity, what would make you consider me?</p>

<p>Anyway, if people could give me some kind of assurance if what I want to do is not out of the question (or let me know it is), along with some pointers on how to be successful in finding a position.</p>

<p>Really appreciate it,

Should I Disclose Mental Health Conditions to a Potential Advisor Before Applying to the Program?,"<p>I know there are a lot of questions about whether or not to disclose mental health issues to advisors, but the difference is that I'm asking whether to disclose these conditions before they agree to supervise me. (Thus, I don't think this is a duplicate of <em>To break mental health condition to potential new advisor</em> because in that post, the professor had already agreed to supervise the student.) Also, unlike the other posters who are primarily concerned with diminished productivity and/or having to take time off, my condition hurt my relationship with a professor. </p>

<p>Here's what happened: <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/149568/how-would-you-react-if-a-student-complained-to-the-dept-chair-about-you-but-lat"">How Would You React If a Student Complained to the Dept. Chair About You but Later Apologized and Disclosed Mental Illness?</a></p>

<p>Most of my problems stemmed not from the grievance itself but from persistently trying to have it dismissed, which I do not regret. However, since the university sent me a cease and desist letter (and all faculty know about the situation, or at the least know to forward any communication from me to the General Counsel's Office), they may mention or allude to this in a letter or recommendation. So it may be best for me to explain everything  prior to applying. </p>

<p>Anxiety also affects me in other ways. For example, I fear flying. Since advisors often encourage their students to travel for research/conferences, she should probably know about this phobia as well. Best case scenario, she's understanding and uses this information to better communicate with me and help me avoid stressors. However, she could also decline to advise me. (If it's relevant, this is for a master's degree.) </p>
",150120,06-06-2020 06:01,To break mental health condition to potential new advisor?,"<p>I will be meeting with a professor tomorrow who I previously asked to supervise me. I believe he has the right knowledge to assess the standing of my work in the interdisciplinary field I work in and help me moving forward.</p>
<p>He said yes and gave me some suggestions which I partly followed, but the last time we spoke was in May.</p>
<p>I am currently struggling with issues related to mental health (<a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/83059/how-to-deal-with-fear-of-failure-as-a-phd-student"">see this question here</a>) and have been in the past months, although it took a while to realize the depth and take action. They are not diagnosed but they probably include a mixture of: low self-esteem, impostor syndrome, anxiety, and acts of self-sabotage. These are linked and the names I feel are not strictly important. I am currently seeing a psychoanalyst (to address the root causes) and the well being/mentoring program of the university (to get practical suggestions and coping strategies). Fighting on.</p>
<p>I seek two things from the professor:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Relevant advice and (within reason) some mentoring whenever my
cross-field preparation is weak.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An external commitment device that provides motivation for work and<br />
help me overcome some of my issues.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I think I have 1. covered, but I am looking for suggestions on how to discuss 2, especially whether I should break the information about my mental health issues with him.</p>
<p>I see two possible ways to go:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I can simply set the pace by saying &quot;I would like to meet every week to discuss my progress&quot; and not mention my (alleged) conditions. This will be enough to set a weekly deadline for myself and would surely be helpful.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I could mention my issues to some extent. One of the reasons I didn't
ask him to meet before is an ongoing self-sabotage/perfectionism
which makes me unwilling to show my work until it has reached a
satisfactory level. I now realize that, essentially, this
satisfactory level is short of publication-grade material and
clearly impossible without expert feedback. I am afraid of course
that this could: sound like an excuse for my absence and lack of
advancement; mark me as a &quot;bad apple&quot;; monopolize the conversation
away from content; be plain awkward; as I write this answer I am also concerned about <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/66343/my-advisor-said-he-has-to-mention-my-mental-health-condition-in-recommendation-l"">him having to disclose this information later on</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is ill-timed, as the meeting is tomorrow (but I wanted to break the cycle of postponing this and I could always go with 1. right above and postpone breaking the mental health &quot;coming out&quot; to a more appropriate time), but any suggestions from you would be a great help.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
I ended up doing something midway between telling and not. I have hinted at the fact that I was somewhat stressed out and partially disclosed a concrete example (checking a computation for over three days out of a fear it might be wrong). He said he understands this kind of difficulties as well as my need to have someone to talk the fine details over. I believe he caught the implications and was overall very kind and sympathetic. Unfortunately, he will be entering a half-year sabbatical soon and might not guarantee his presence until the start of the next academic years, but said he would like to read what I am working on and pointed me to others who might be of help.</p>

Research topics,"<p>im a 2nd year Computer Science student, and I wanted to start doing research.</p>

<p>Im looking for a topic to research on, or more specifically i want to know how researchers do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find a research question they can answer</li>
<li>Manage to actually solve that question</li>
</ol>

<p>Do they try to research in more than one area and see where they can do progress? or are they focused on some specific question? If so, then how would you know you can actually solve it?</p>

<p>In addition, where can I find inspiration for research topics?</p>

<p>And just general information on me: im an 18 years old student, and i do my CS degree through a special program. Last year, i have done a project with 4 of my friends (under supervision of the program director). In the project, me and my friends took a (20 years old) paper, and wanted to improve and implement the ideas shown in it. Honestly - It was really fun to try and think up new ways to improve it (and we did!), and since then I really have wanted to write a research paper of my own - but i have no idea how to get started</p>
",150192,07-06-2020 20:20,How to come up with research ideas?,"<p>As a very new researcher who is exploring the best way to generate ideas, some guidance on this question would be very helpful. I have found that this is NOT easy. Ideas seem to pop out of my Professor every day and I wonder how he does it. This question is broad;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How do you tend to come up with initial/seed ideas? What is your search method (if you have one)?</p></li>
<li><p>What proportion of your ideas for past papers come from; (i) colleagues, (ii) intentionally browsing the literature for ideas, (iii) on the spot inspiration, (iv) conferences, (v) other?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you prioritize research ideas?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there any special, generalizable method that you've discovered to sift out those ideas that are likely to be unrealistic early on in the process of idea generation?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Based on small amounts of anecdotal evidence I have reason to believe that there is vast heterogeneity among professors regarding the above questions. For example, economist Steven Levitt says he works on 22 papers at once. A professor I know will have maybe 25% of this at any one time.</p>

Hence the editor asked for revise and resubmission and also mention that if we comply with the reviewer's comments, he will personally read that article. Accordingly, we revise and resubmit that paper. It has been 7 months since our resubmission and they still do not give any feedback. Since I am a Ph.D. student, such a long review process is hurting my Ph.D. process. Can anyone suggest me what should be my action in this regard? Should I send the editor an email?

<hr>

<p>The best way seems to be through coauthorship but ...</p>

<p>On the one hand I can be hands-off and rather give them feedback as best as I can but let them do most of the work themselves, sort of like a ""sink or swim"" strategy.</p>

<p>On the other hand I can be hands-on and rewrite the paper (or large parts of it) and hope that they learn from the example I give.</p>

<p>On the one hand I want them to learn to write papers without me some day and I want them to learn as quickly as possible to take load off me.</p>

<p>On the other hand I want us to publish in the best place possible with as little stress as possible.</p>

<p>On the one hand I want them to see the peer review comments from what they themselves have written.</p>

<p>On the other hand I do not want them to be discouraged by the peer review system early on and do not want to submit papers I know we could have written better.</p>

<p>On the one hand I want them to get confidence by being published and presenting work at good venues.</p>

<p>On the other hand I wonder if they need to get there themselves to get that confidence boost.</p>

<hr>

<p>At the moment I'm very hands on. There's a few factors for this: I don't like submitting papers that are not up to a certain standard, I'm a native English speaker in a non-English speaking country with non-native speaking students, publications are a high priority for me, etc.</p>

<p>But recently a friend/colleague warned me that I should not be so hands-on with the writing of the papers of my students. He pointed to recently graduated researchers in my area that published good work as students but who struggled after leaving their PhD supervisor saying their supervisor did them no favours in the long term ... that by being so hands on, while the students have success getting published and so forth with me, I'm not really doing the most important thing a good supervisor should do: making myself obsolete.</p>

<hr>

<p>My question is how to train students to write good research papers and in what ways can I balance being hands-on and hands-off?</p>

<p>I'm also interested in methods not directly involving coauthorship.</p>

I have expended three years of my life in pursuing a thing that it is useless and purely theoretical. Currently, I only want to make some good money in the industry.

Self citation and plagiarism,"<p>This remains an old concern of mine, and something I have never been able to wrap my head around. For instance, I have never understood why using your own sentences that <em>you have crafted</em> without citing yourself counts as plagiarism.</p>
<p>That being said- I am currently working on a paper and describing the data section, and the dataset is common enough that I see myself using it in the future for another paper. The efficient thing to do here would be to use the same description for both papers. This would, however, be considered as plagiarism. How can one reasonably be accused of plagiarism here? The data section is ancillary to both papers, is not based on a 'novel' idea, but is purely descriptive. To describe the data again using different words <em>just for the sake of not plagiarizing from myself</em> seems to be waste of time. Now imagine this happening to thousands of researchers over many years. It seems to me that productive hours that are wasted for such a strange, and honestly, unnecessary formality. Am I missing something here?</p>
",150536,14-06-2020 23:30,Attitudes towards self-plagiarism,"<p>I am planning to write several papers exploring various aspects of the same scientific question.

<p>It would be fantastic if I could simply copy-and-paste the same introduction, or, at least, 90% of it.  This seems to me to be ethically unproblematic. After all, I need to say the exact same things every time, and I certainly don't mind the self-plagiarism. Am I hurting the reader in any way? I suppose I might be, if the reader desired an introduction which consists of original material, but that is an odd desire, isn't it? Its the research, the stuff that follows the intro, that is original.</p>
<p>Sadly, I have gotten wind that the majority of the research community apparently does not agree with the sentiments expressed in the previous paragraph. This leads me here to ask a series of related questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>To what extent is self-plagiarism in non-technical bits considered acceptable? I often see authors recycle paragraphs but I have never seen anyone cut-and-paste the entire section outright.</p>

<p>Mr. A is a Ph.D. student of some institute who was working with Prof. B of another institute on a very interesting mathematical problem since last three years. Recently, they came across a significant solution to it. They wrote a research article to publish in a very good mathematics journal that accepts the online submission.</p>

<p>Prof. B wanted to submit it to the journal by himself. Mr. A agreed. </p>

<p>A few days ago, Mr. A wanted to know about the submission of their article via telephone. Prof. B informed that the article is submitted. But, Mr. A received any confirmation e-mail neither from the journal nor Prof. B forwarded the submission mail to him. Prof. B did not upload it in arXiv, which is a free preprint repository.</p>

<p>Mathematics journals used to take a long duration to review and publish an article. Prof. B told that submitting this article to arXiv will immediately attract community attention. Many researchers will start working in the new direction. As a result, Mr. A and Prof. B may lose their opportunity to work on that problems. Also, the article may be stolen.</p>

<p>Mr. A did not ask Prof. B to forward the submission confirmation mail to him. Prof. might think that Mr. A is suspecting him. It may affect the relationship. Also, Prof. is a very powerful person in the administration, who may prevent an opportunity for Mr. A to gain a job. Again from some of his friends, Mr. A came to know that Prof. had distributed related research problems to his collaborators.</p>

<p>As a consequence, Mr. A is thinking that Prof. has submitted this work in his own name and he has lost his credit as the first author of this article.</p>

<p>Now the question is: How Mr. A may save his credit and his work without hampering his relationship with Prof B?</p>

<li>While applying for post-docs/faculty positions in academia</li>
<li>While applying to industrial research labs</li>

<p>For instance, I've read on some forums (I can't locate the link now) that while considering prospective applications for tenure-track faculty positions, very few Universities accept a candidate who has completed his/her Ph.D from a lower ranked school having a lesser ""brand"" value, irrespective of the fact whether he/she has published equally original work as his/her counterpart from an Ivy league college. How much truth is in this statement? It would be really great if someone already in academia, either as a newly-accepted faculty or someone on the Faculty Hiring committee could share their experiences/statistics on this regard. I'm simply interested to know the answer, without commenting at all on whether such a practice is justifiable.</p>

<p>Similarly, what about recruitment to internationally acclaimed research labs (like <a href=""http://www.watson.ibm.com/overview.shtml"">IBM T.J.Watson lab</a> or <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/default.aspx"">Microsoft research lab</a>) - what importance do they place on the pedigree of a candidate's college, before taking into consideration what they published ?</p>

Can I start such a contact with one researcher that does not know me in one online conference?,"<p>I have a major in Mathematics and a masters in Physics and am currently starting my PhD in Physics. Since I've started my masters I am very interested in one particular research field. The main developments in this field have been carried out by a group lead by a very respected researcher. Moreover the book he wrote about the subject together with the papers of his group are what made me be interested in the field.</p>
<p>For my PhD I wanted to work with this field. My supervisor works in related stuff and he spent one year in the US doing his own research, but in a group that was actively discussing the subject I'm interested in, so that he got interested as well. In that case he accepted to supervise me. We are right now deciding on what to take as a concrete objective.</p>
<p>In that sense I had one particular idea that my supervisor really enjoyed and said it could really be the way to go. We are discussing now the particular details.</p>
<p>Now, I'm participating on one online conference and that physicist who leads the group which is making the most significant contributions to the field is participating. Moreover people say that he is approachable and there is one particular moment every day in the conference on which people are encouraged to talk to one another.</p>
<p>In that setting, I have been considering starting an interaction with that professor and ask him his view on the general idea of my proposal. In fact, in one of his papers there is one very short footnote briefly saying that one could perhaps do something related to what I have in mind, but his group followed a distinct direction.</p>
<p>Now while I think that trying to talk to him could be beneficial I fear whether or not I can do it and how to approach it in this online environment.</p>
<p>For starters he doesn't know me and we don't have any common acquaintances. Isn't it a bit of too much asking him privately in one online conference an opinion about an idea I had for my PhD project?</p>

In the meanwhile I have managed to secure a PhD offer from another 2 universities much better in world rankings and with better research groups and better faculty. Additionally these 2 universities do research exactly on what I want to devote my PhD research.</p>

<p>My only commitment to the first university is a mail confirming I accept. Nothing else. I understand declining the offer after already having accepted it is quite dishonest but it is a huge decision that will affect my future in a very significant level. </p>

<p>I would like your opinion and I would also like to ask for possible consequences of such an action. As far a postdocs concerned, in the first university there is no chance I ever get a postdoc since they do not actually do research on my area (except for the prospective supervisor and even he not as much).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
I have decided to do as I was afraid to. I have decided to choose a different university than the first one that I have already accepted the offer. My offer acceptance included: </p>

<ul>
<li>An online ""I accept"" statement.</li>
<li>An e-mail I sent stating ""I accept the scholarship and this University is my first option""</li>
</ul>

<p>I do not have any legal commitments since I have not signed anything. The supervisor of the first university though is really nice to me and continuously was sending me mails. <strong>How do I very nicely tell her I will not be joining in the end?</strong> Additionally the place I will go in the end will be for research in Mathematics and not Physics. Can I use this as a part of a sensical excuse?</p>

<p>I think that I should let people, especially other beginning grad students know what happened with my case. I have chosen to nicely tell the first university I got accepted that I will not be attending and will not be pursuing a PhD there since I decided I have different research interests (which is true). I had applied there in the first place since I was not sure what I wanted to do and because it was a nice program. Despite that, I got an offer from a World top university to work on 100% my research interests. I explained this to them, the first uni, and they happily let me go and wished me good luck, especially the supervisor who faught a lot secure me funding. I was lucky.</p>

Overly long review process (>2 years) without feedback,"<p>We submitted a paper to a journal more than 2 years ago. After 1 year had passed without any news, I asked the editors for an update on the status of our paper, and they mentioned they were still waiting for referee reports. After the second year of waiting, I wrote another email about a status update, without getting any response from the editors. The long process is a real nuisance for all authors involved, in particular for the junior ones who need publications on their track record.

Proper way of including pictures into the Master's thesis,"<p>I'm doing mathematics and my thesis consists mainly of understanding and elaborating couple of articles, writing clearly everything down, and possibly including a little of my own original work at the end. Of course, I am citing everything, and also I am not copypasting, rather writing known stuff with my own words and trying to be more detailed.</p>
<p>But I am not sure what to do with the pictures(there are about 20 of them which are relatively difficult to draw, next to the 30-35 pages of plain text). I have an access to the tex files of these articles and could easily copy paste the code for pictures. On the other hand, I could write down(rather draw) everything by myself, and anyway I would properly cite the source because many of these pictures represent ideas behind which are not mine.</p>
<p>So what should I do? On the one hand, straight copypasting is not good. On the other hand, this is not a piece of text where I could write more details, although if I wouldn't have seen those pictures but I would been explained the ideas, then I would have drawn slightly differently. Should I draw everything by myself, while trying to be visually different then authors(while properly citing them of course).</p>

How to deal with blinding when the new paper is a continuation of one's own prior research?,"<p>I wrote a paper (P1) which went through peer review and got published. The paper introduced a new graphical user interface (GUI) primitive.</p>
<p>I then wrote P2, which extends P1, turning it into a new class of UI, which had no analogs at the time of writing (and maybe still doesn't, but the window of opportunity is shrinking).</p>
<p>P2 is not just a thin layer on top of P1, it comes with substantial enhancements that are the result of our &quot;lessons learned from P1&quot; analysis + new ideas.</p>
<p>P2 stands on its own, and it refers to P1 as if it were written by other people, per conference requirements. P2 also provides a short intro about P1, such that someone unfamiliar with P1 can still get the picture. It also provides comparisons to analogs of P1, explaining how our approach differs and arguing that our approach is better.</p>
<p>The set of P1 analogs consists of ~5 papers. One is a preprint, 3 are just providing their designs but not including any usability evaluation details at all, or deferring that to future work. This leaves us with one good alternative, which we were not aware of at the time work on P2 started. However, we did refer to this alternative in our related work section and compared it to our own product (there are some ideological differences in our approaches).</p>
<p>P2 explains that we chose to base our work on P1, because <em>at the time of writing P1 was the only artifact of its kind that has gone through formal usability tests and provides detailed results of their evaluation process</em>. Of course, the fundamental underlying reason is that P2 is the continuation of our previous work on P1.</p>
<p>P2 has been submitted for peer review, and a reviewer rejected it, one of the reasons being <em>&quot;it only considers one paper [referring to P1] containing a very similar design&quot;</em>.</p>
<p><strong>What is the right way to explain why P2 is built on top of P1 without compromising anonymity?</strong></p>
<p>p.s. note that the reviewer in question seems to have forgotten about the section where we compare P1 to alternatives. It could be that that section is not convincing enough, not well-written - but in that case the reviewer would have said &quot;it is not convincing enough&quot; rather than &quot;only considers one paper&quot;. The review is otherwise thorough, I cannot say that I have the impression the reviewer hasn't read the paper fully.</p>

"What to do when the reviewer is wrong about your paper's scope, technically inaccurate, and clearly haven't read your rebuttals","<p>You might think the title is a bit of an exaggeration, however this is exactly what has happened.</p>
<p>Note: No, I can't find my answer on How to React to Incorrect Claims by Reviewers? as it addresses the rebuttals/revisions but my question is about what to do after the final decision. (no rebuttal chance)</p>
<p>The reviewer can not differentiate X from Y, is technically wrong and obviously have no in-depth expertise, no let me put it this way even an undergrad knows X from Y, they suggested this is not the first paper using Y in A, when my paper is using X in B (totally different methodology and scope and even the problem addressed).</p>
<p>Moreover, they told me they think the format of my abstract is &quot;extremely odd&quot; because it is divided in 4 sections and they haven't seen it anywhere when it is the author's guidelines, and I sent them the link to the author guidelines and the template file, also copy/pasted that part and included in rebuttal -  and they wrote they &quot;still think it is extremely odd and they haven't seen it elsewhere&quot;.</p>
<p>After receiving my first reviews and submitted a complete rebuttal making changes to answer ALL questions, revised writing, added supplementary materials, I was still waiting to hear from the journal after almost 3 months (one week short) for revision - I am a reviewer for the same journal and I am asked to submit reviews in 3 weeks!! so I asked them why it was taking so long, and in a few days I get the reviews and the reject.</p>
<p>The other reviewer's first review was &quot;the technical writing is weak&quot; - this was ALL, no details, no directions - I made substantial changes and wrote very much in detail, the math, the narrative and they wrote &quot;I should reorganize and submit as new&quot; with no details, no directions.</p>
<p>I feel so frustrated, I had an experience like this with the same journal before and got an even worse one who said &quot;the paper was clearly written by a native speaker and that native speaker should help the other revise&quot; - I wrote the whole paper! They also wrote some technical claims about my methodology which was plain wrong.</p>
<p>AND! again, it was also the same - I asked them why it was taking so long (over 4 months after my revision), and in a few days I get the reviews and the reject. Moreover, someone had snatched my exact methodology and used for the same problem and submitted to that journal later. As a reviewer I see papers being accepted all the time with much less novelty and technical writing.</p>
<p>I really don't understand how the editor even lets this happen, the part about the abstract's format made its way to the both reviews! Even after my correction. The reviewer clearly thinks my paper is on something else entirely and lacks expertise.</p>
<p>How can I refute this? Can I refute this? are they doing this on purpose to gatekeep me?</p>
<p>there are not many journals in my field, because this one took so long I couldn't make it to other major conferences, and now I wanted to submit to another journal which is a bit different in scope and is much harder to get into -but- I am not even sure I can because my journal submission here is also accepted as a paper (first version) -but- is not published yet (so I can't submit to another journal because I would need to make a reference to the paper version). Also these are all supposedly Q1 journals.</p>
<p>Should I submit to the same journal and hope there will be reviewers with some common sense? Would I be rejected right away? Considering how slow they have been (7.5 months for these kind of reviews! I doubt they will be kind to answer my emails)</p>
",152353,29-07-2020 20:06,How to React to Incorrect Claims by Reviewers?,"<p><em>As this has happened to me several times for different papers now, I am not describing a specific case here, but the abstract aspects that were common to all situations.</em></p>

<p>Occasionally, in the ""Tasks"" or ""Materials"" section of the ""Evaluation"" or ""User Study"" chapter, papers of mine contain statements such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Figure ... shows one of the tasks from the user study. The correct answer was ... .""</li>
<li>""For the user study, we had prepared eight tasks. They were given in the form of natural-language questions. Users were supposed to use our novel concept to input the appropriate parameters as described by the questions. Questions ranged from simple (such as '...?', see Figure ... for the solution) to complex (such as '...?', cf. solution in Figure ...).""</li>
</ul>

<p>In these cases, the figure captions once again mention the figures depict questions and/or solutions from the user study.</p>

<p>Occasionally, these are met with reviewer comments such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>""The paper does not provide any example of the tasks presented during the user study. It would greatly improve the quality of the paper if the authors could at least provide one such example. Without this, I find it very hard to get a clear idea of how the study was conducted, and thereby, I also cannot tell how reliable the results presented in Section ... are.""</li>
</ul>

<p><em>I base my reasoning on the idea that this reviewer comment is, plain and simple, incorrect, as I did provide concrete examples of tasks. If I am somehow mistaken about this, please do let me know.</em></p>

<p>While such statements were certainly not the only reason for voting to reject, some of the reviewers who wrote something along these lines made it rather clear that they saw the alleged lack of any task examples as one of the most critical issues with the submission.</p>

<p>My question focuses on the situation that such a paper is getting revised - either, because it was accepted after all, and I am preparing a camera-ready version, or because it was rejected, and I am trying to improve it before submitting it elsewhere: <strong>What is the appropriate reaction with respect to such comments?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ignore the statements and do not change anything about the respective examples in my paper.</strong> This might be a viable way to go, but it leaves a bad taste to completely ignore some reviewer statements, even though they are clearly comprehensible and <em>should</em> be straightforward to implement.</li>
<li><strong>Re-word the sentences mentioning the examples.</strong> I might do that, but I am wary of making things worse, as I already consider the respective statements in my paper quite unambiguous as they are.</li>
<li><strong>Add more examples, and possibly at different locations.</strong> This could make it harder to miss the examples, but in CS conference papers, space is an extremely scarce resource.</li>
<li><strong>Ask the editor.</strong> Especially in cases where the paper was eventually still accepted, this seems quite extreme to me. I feel contacting the editor should be reserved to truly exceptional and severe issues, not ""every-day worries"" of all authors who are preparing their CR-versions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that I am not asking <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/23836/paper-rejection-based-on-unfair-review"">how to deal with the review decision</a>. Even though it is slightly annoying if a rejection is indeed based on incorrect reviewer statements, I am ok with resubmitting a revised version elsewhere. I am specifically asking <em>how</em> to revise the particular parts that were incorrectly criticized.</p>

<p>Some peculiarities of my field to note that might not be obvious:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only some conferences have a rebuttal phase. If they do, it is not guaranteed (or even reasonably likely) that especially reviewers who criticized a paper a lot will actually read the rebuttal and possibly even amend their review. Also, these rebuttals are usually limited in length (e.g. to 500 words), so you can usually mention only a selection of all issues raised by reviewers.</li>
<li>CR-versions are rarely accompanied with explanatory letters to the editors (or, more precisely, the program committee) in my experience.

<ul>
<li>Submission usually happens by means of web-based submission systems which allow the upload of exactly one PDF file, which is sometimes automatically checked on formal factors, such as number of pages (so even tacking an extra page with explanatory notes in front of the paper will not work).</li>
<li>If an opportunity is provided to upload some additional files, this is usually meant for uploading sources and supplementary material such as videos that will be put on the proceedings CD. It is not clear whether the material will be sifted thoroughly enough so letters to the editors will be found in time and treated appropriately.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>My field is related to HCI.

<ul>
<li>Therefore, contributions are sometimes graphical in nature. Consequently, figures sometimes do not just provide information <em>about</em> the contribution (statistical graphs, exemplary architectures), figures are often a crucial part for <em>showing</em> the contribution. In other words, sometimes, the depiction <em>is</em> the contribution, or it shows how the novel concept presented in the paper does something.</li>
<li>User studies are used to test how well human users can get along with the novel concept. Therefore, tasks are often written as questions. Study participants then have to find the correct answers to these questions by using the novel concept being tested. This usually means that they have to interact/make inputs with/in the implemented prototype that shows the novel concept. This is meant to mimick how the concept would be used in real life, where users would use the respective novel HCI technique for retrieving information, as well.</li>

How to overcome feelings of incompetence/failure in a PhD programme?,"<p>I've recently quit my job as a maths teacher after doing it for 3 years and I have been incredibly lucky to be offered a fully funded doctoral training course at a top university. This is an extraordinary opportunity for me, especially given that I previously withdrew from a PhD, and this time I really want to make it work.</p>

<p>I am quite rusty on some things that many other starting students will not be, not because I can't do them but because it's been a very long time since I needed to apply them. I am currently a bit worried that I may be the weakest in the cohort or that it'll take me a very long time to understand simple things and that I may feel incompetent and like I don't deserve to be there.</p>

",113833,17-07-2018 17:17,How should I deal with becoming discouraged as a graduate student?,"<p>I am a third year (starting fourth year in the fall) PhD student in mathematics. I've passed all qualifying exams and am currently doing research. As far as I can tell, I am not doing poorly. I have the good fortune of having a great advisor, being in a very supportive department, and having friends and family who genuinely care about my success. </p>

<p>The fact is research is hard. It appears to consist primarily of staring at a problem for days and days and days without getting anywhere. Sometimes, rarely, I do figure something out and that feels wonderful, but the overwhelming majority of my time appears to be spent banging my head against a mostly figurative wall. I am not complaining about the material being hard, and I am not averse to putting in hard work, but I get frequently discouraged when I realize the vast volumes of mathematics that I yet know nothing about (and probably never will). It's very hard to quantify progress - in particular, there are too few tangible returns after too many hours worked. I find myself thinking along the lines of ""Oh, if only someone actually smart were thinking about this problem they would have solved it in moments"" and so on. </p>

<p>I've talked about this to some number of people; here is some advice I have received:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take a day off. Putting in hours upon hours of trying things doesn't magically lead to a solution, particularly if the brain is tired and just wants to sleep.</li>
<li>Have a hobby. Since math research doesn't exactly provide instant gratification, a hobby might provide some instead. </li>
<li>Talk to other graduate students. Realize that many graduate students go through this.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm interested to know how other folks have dealt with being discouraged as a graduate student. Does it get better with time and experience? Is this a sign that research is not for me and that I should seriously consider a life outside academia?</p>

As ArXiv enables you to update your papers, it would be possible to include a citation to the new paper in the old paper after the aforementioned sentence. This might save a reader of the old paper some time with finding the new paper.</p>

As usual, I immediately checked the papers to find out if the authors were praising or criticising my work (or perhaps they found a mistake in one of my papers!). To my surprise, in one case the authors wrote a misleading statement which resulted from stretching quite a lot some of my conclusions. In the other case, the authors simply made an incorrect claim (details below for the curious). It's not the first time this happens to me - I even got one citation completely out of context once. How to react to this kind of situation?</p>

<hr>

<p>Details for the curious:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the first case, the authors cite a paper of mine where I compare two different methods to calculate elastic properties of materials. My main conclusion is that one of the methods converges much faster than the other one with the size of the basis set - in other words, it's computationally much cheaper. For calculations with usual basis sets the first method is much more accurate than the second one, with disagreements between the two in the order of 10% or even 20%. They claim that I show that both methods agree within a 1% of each other, which is misleading at best, because for the second method to agree within 1% of the first one one needs to do a very expensive calculation. That is one of the main points of the paper and it got completely overlooked by the authors.</p></li>
<li><p>In the second case, the citation is plainly wrong. The authors cite my paper as an experimental work on InGaN semiconductors while it actually is purely computational.</p></li>

Applying for funding when you can self fund,"<p>So this is the issue... There is this university that I’m interested in applying to for my PhD. I think the chances of me getting an offer to carry out my research there are very high if I let them know that I will be self funding; which I could do. It won’t be easy but I should be able to make it work. The thing is that, the university also offers PhD scholarships which I am eligible for, but these funded places are more competitive and although I’d stand a chance, it could go either way. My thinking is, why pay all that money for this degree if there is a chance I could get funding?</p>

<p>However, the problem is that I’ve been told by people I know who work in university admissions that it often happens that even if a university likes an applicant but can’t offer funding when the student has asked, they reject their application outright.</p>

<p>My questions are, should I just apply for the funding only and say nothing about my capability to fund my degree? Or should I let them know that I can self fund but still apply for the funding (which I think is counterintuitive)? Or forget about funding altogether and self fund?</p>
",131831,13-06-2019 06:38,"I am able to self-fund a PhD, how can I use this when applying?","<p>Some candidates have the personal or family resources to self-fund their graduate studies, or already know that they are willing to take on debt for them (disregard whether this is a good idea, which has <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/29504/is-it-worth-self-funding-a-phd-to-attend-a-top-10-university"">been</a> <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/31679/graduate-school-without-full-funding"">addressed</a> <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/18755/implications-of-being-accepted-without-funding"">before</a>). They still, however, need to actually be admitted to a graduate school, and having funding doesn't guarantee admission.</p>

<p>The ability to self-fund obviously makes it possible to take unfunded offers, but are there any other ways to actively leverage this funding situation during the application process?

Dealing with misconceptions when proposing a new idea as an outsider to a field,"<p>I have some ideas related to computer architecture/electrical engineering on which I would like to get feedback from academics.</p>

<p>A professor at a university I visited has the belief that something I proposed is crackpot, and that I must be delusional for not accepting his arguments. I turned up out of the blue one day for the first meeting, which I suspect many ""crackpots"" likely do, and I suspect that this fact alone has made him tune out.</p>

<p>He has a very fixed mental model of the concepts being dealt with, and makes many assumptions that only hold in certain cases, for particular definitions of a concept, or for what has been observed so far but not tested in the context of the idea. An unfairly high standard of proof is then requested of me, when a much less clear-cut body of evidence, or less-rigorous tests lend support to my claim. Discussions with other people educated in the area are more fruitful, but the same fallacies that only apply conditionally are frequently trotted out.</p>

<p>I am not formally educated in the field, and he uses this during every part of the conversation to insist that only a learned person (professor or researcher in the field) has the ability or competence to comprehend the concepts properly (which is false), and that only such a trained person who has built themselves up from the bottom can develop and spot flaws in the difficult concepts entertained.  </p>

<p>(This is not true, and I believe the following analogy applies to my situation: one can easily run or swim before they can walk.)</p>

<p>Competence doesn't always make you strictly better at something in the same way that one number is always bigger than another.</p>

<p>If I ask him to not dismiss these options and rebuttals out of hand, he simply says that everyone says that... Bozo the Galileo clown...  you're not right because you're laughed at. <a href=""http://amasci.com/freenrg/arrhenus.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A strawman</a> which I never implied - I am being laughed at (because I am right?) in spite of being right. </p>

<p>Since I'm introducing new terminology and modifying existing terminology (while trying to clearly explain what I mean by it) in some of these discussions, I have also been ridiculed for essentially describing something that few others understand, and accused of 'trying to sound smart and be the next lone genius' of the field. Without this new terminology, explaining what I mean by it gets clunky and easy to confuse with similar concepts already employed in the field.</p>

<p>What can I do to open some kind of productive dialogue or actually get heard out (should I talk about the details of the ideas here)? Publishing a full academic paper (as an outsider) and going through potential rigamarole during the process seems a poor option to me; though pointers would be appreciated if you feel this is appropriate regardless. I'm quite sure that I'm either right about this idea, or any errors in it have not been brought up yet and are in the more minute details.</p>

How can I up my confidence level in my technical skills?,"<p>Let me paint a picture of my background in brief. I did my undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering. I was a good student (almost all A's) till my high school. However, I struggled a lot in my first two years of engineering. I failed 3 subjects and had to retake them. I did fairly well in my last two years and managed a GPA of 3.7. But, my early failure played a heavy toll on my self confidence. I always felt and still feel like I am not worthy for my grades or getting a job.</p>

<p>I was interested in research, so went to a better school for master's degree. Again, though I had very good grades there, I struggled a lot during my job interviews. I always felt inadequate and unconfident about my ability to sustain in that job. As a result I did not get selected in those companies. I got offer in a small company which hired me only looking at my grades. My professors also said that I deserve better workplace but I didn't get it only because of my lack of self confidence and technical speaking skills.</p>

<p>I figured that, since I loved doing research, I should go for a PhD. I worked hard during the last five years. I tried coming out of my comfort zone, try different things, work on challenging projects. I started feeling confident midway through my PhD. However, now I am in my last year and towards the end of writing my thesis. And I am feeling the same anxiety of technical inadequacy and unworthiness.</p>

<p><em>Why I asked this question:</em></p>

<p>Beyond the obvious reason that this is something I have struggled with for many years and only recently gotten a handle on myself, there's also some evidence that merely realizing that other people experience imposter syndrome helps fellow imposters. As a grad student, I've managed to meet a fair number of people who are in their own struggles with imposter syndrome; however, the tactics and self-trickery that have helped me don't always speak to them and perhaps someone else's methods might. </p>

How to reuse/cite your paper in your thesis when both have same topic,"<p>I’m writing my thesis and I submitted a paper on the same topic to a conference, where it got accepted. However, the contents such as methods, results, and conclusion are identical in text, i.e. I copy pasted the content from thesis to the paper.</p>

<p>Now I want to submit my thesis but I suppose it is self-plagiarism if I don't cite my paper. My question is, can use the same content in my thesis and paper if yes then how do I mention that content is reused? or should I rephrase my complete thesis now and then cite paper? But if I rephrase then how about the experiment results and figures? should I cite paper there as well?</p>

Substantial changes to manuscript in the revision process,"<p>Is this acceptable to revise a manuscript more than what reviewers suggested? In fact, due to some issue, the authors may find out that there are some issues even reviewers could not address, so they decided to extend the revision border.</p>

<p>P.s. What about imposing changes so that affect the title, abstract and a large portion of  manuscript. In an advise to a friend of mine, I warned him of doing so because it results in a new paper not a standard revised version. Nonetheless, I told him that is the case of such comprehensive revision he should carefully explain reasons behind that decision. Can such rational explanation convince the reviewers to consider another round of review?</p>

<p>I understand that this would create extra work for the reviewers since they would have to check that part again.

Citing articles in a Language I don't understand,"<p>I'm writing the thesis for my master degree, some of the very very old articles I have to cite are in a foreign language I don't understand (usually German and French). Most of them have been translated in my native language and/or English, but in some cases I didn't find a translation.</p>

<p>Even if I'm asking it for the thesis I think it does apply in more serious cases of research too.</p>

<p>An example would be for example if I write that the Friedman Lemaitre Robertson Walker metric in general relativity was first derived by Lemaitre in 1922. If I cite his original article in French at this point, would I be doing something wrong since I don't understand French and I can't understand what's written there? This is just an example, I'm pretty sure an English version of Lemaitre article exists, I just didn't check.</p>

<p>I mean I assume that when someone cites an article he' read and understood it.</p>

<p>My opinion is that I shouldn't cite the original article at all but cite someone else who cites it, knowing what was written in the original article.</p>

<p>Am I overthinking it and I should just simply cite these articles or is there a better procedure?</p>

Since it was important but not crucial, I ended up not using the paper. Except for its abstract, which was in English, the entire paper was in this other language. It had graphs and images that I could understand without knowing the language.</p>

<p>At the time, I was tempted to use Google Translate in order to get the general idea of the paper  (in more detail than what is given in the abstract), while not necessarily trusting on the specific information that the translation gave me (<a href=""https://www.argotrans.com/blog/accurate-google-translate-2018/"" rel=""noreferrer"">it can give faulty results at times</a>). Since this would still leave me with some measure of uncertainty — there was no way for me to be sure exactly what it was saying — I thought it better to just let the paper go.</p>

<p>But say that in a future situation I find a crucial paper in a language I don't understand: <strong>if I use Google Translate, using the paper in a situation that does not require specific information but only it's general gist, would citing it be ethically acceptable?</strong></p>

Many well-established journals and major publishers, sadly, prefer not to specify the ""rules of the game"" precisely, particularly how long the review process should normally take. Fortunately, I quite often serve as a referee with the very same journals and know the amount of time I am given to write a review. Unfortunately, when I am an author, I do not observe these deadlines to be always met. For example, a notable U.S. publisher would ask a reviewer to send a review in 2 months; but in practice a first review of my paper once took as long as 8 months.</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb, I usually start writing to editors with questions about ""the status of my paper"" in X+1 months time, when X is a deadline time for a reviewer to submit a review. This strategy is not particularly successful &mdash; what I usually get is a recommendation to be more patient. Since there is no ""official"" deadline time announced, there is no formal ground for complaints here.</p>

<p>Of course, such delays lead to a whole bunch of funny situations, particularly if a preprint is put online (e.g., on arXiv) and the results are presented in some conferences. Follow-ups with no official paper to cite, grant applications in which you can not justify by a solid publication, good research but bad bibliometrics or CV, to name just a few. </p>

<p>Could you recommend an efficient way to deal with this problem?</p>

Husband and wife publishing together - Problem for tenure-track jobs?,"<p>My husband and I work in the same research area (of theoretical computer science). We were in the same PhD program and even had the same advisor. We are a great collaboration team, and really enjoy and are productive when we work together. In addition, neither of us have anyone else to collaborate with because no one in the department really works in quite the same area (not even our advisor - long story). As a result, nearly all of my papers are co-authored with my husband. My husband has a decent number of papers without me as a co-author because he is three years ahead of me in the program, so he has his papers from before I even started, and also has had more time for more papers since I have just completed the class-heavy portion of my PhD. </p>

<p>My husband has recently graduated and is a tenure-track professor at a good university. I would also like to be a professor one day. From what I've seen in my field, spousal hiring seems pretty common. So we figured that we would both apply to a bunch of universities and would end up being hired as a pair. However, we have been worried that us both being in the same research area and publishing together is going to cause difficulties being hired. Since I have a few more years left in the program, my plan is to to have two or three good publications that don't include my husband (I already have one single author paper in a good place).</p>

<p>So my question is, how difficult will it be for us to be hired together into the same department if we have so many papers co-authored together? Will publishing a few good papers without my husband improve the situation to the point that we have a reasonable chance of being hired together, even though a significant amount of my early work was with my husband?</p>

<p>Additional Note: Even just in my department, several of the new hires in the last 3 or 4 years have been husband and wife pairs where they were both hired into the computer science department. So it seems that this practice is currently very common in CS. I have not seen any that shared a research area, though. </p>

<p>Edit: This question is very different from the one asked at 
<a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/q/45706/110952"">PhD Student : Publish Paper with Wife?</a> . That question is primarily about whether it is strange to publish with a spouse at all (and the spouse in question is not in academia), while my question is specifically about my husband and I getting hired together in the same department if we have co-authored a significant amount of our work together. The answers provided there don't really help with this question. </p>

",133452,17-07-2019 02:51,PhD Student : Publish Paper with Wife?,"<p>I am a PhD student, working on Applied Math while my wife is a software engineer. I plan on going to academia after PhD and will start to job hunt soon.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I thought of an idea that hadn't been done before. I wrote a crude C++ code to implement the idea and it worked well. I believed that with my theoretical understanding of the problem and an expert coder, we could make something really impactful and incidentally, my wife knew how to. So, we spent some evenings together writing the code (she didn't know math, but I abstracted each step so she could help implement). The resulting code is fairly sophisticated and does an excellent job. I was wondering, now that I write a paper about it, would it look weird if my wife was listed as a co-author? Her contributions were definitely sufficient to warrant co-authorship by any definition.</p>

<p>Let's step aside the legalese of it (my advisor doesn't care and her company might but let's leave that aside). I am asking more from the standpoint of how it looks on one's CV, job application and possibly, tenure. </p>

Letter of Rec from Lab PI/Brother,"<p>I am a college student considering applying to PhD programs both in the US and internationally. Currently I research in a lab affiliated with a top US university and run by my older brother, an instructor at that university. I really enjoy my research here and hope to continue with it; however, I worry about getting letters of recommendation for grad school. I will ask professors in project based classes at my university, but if I continue with this lab as I hope to, only my brother will be qualified to write one about my research abilities. Although the group has other affiliated instructors, my brother oversees the division I research in and my work. Will an admissions committee simply chalk a letter from him up to nepotism or, provided I demonstrate meaningful research, understand the circumstances?</p>

Explain award on CV?,"<p>I recently received an award. It's relatively prestigious (even internationally), but it's not well-known outside of my discipline, and its name is not very explicit (nor is it in English). Should I explain it on my CV? I was thinking of copying the one-sentence blurb on the award's website, something like ""rewards people who have achieved this and this in this discipline"". I don't see how it can hurt, but I have not seen anyone else do it...</p>

<li>Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry Potter scholarship.</li>
<li>Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry Potter scholarship: awarded to one student every year for demonstrated excellence in horcrux-gathering.</li>
</ol>

<p>For certain things, I feel like the first does not include enough context, beyond some very well-known things (such as a Fulbright or Goldwater, neither of which I have received). For some particular names I have in mind the second looks pretty clunky and does not always fit on a single line. The third option is even clunkier, and might be perceived as an attempt to add fluff to inflate the CV. I am personally leaning towards the second option, but I don't know that it adds much value beyond the first option. </p>

<p>Is there an accepted way to list awards/scholarships? Should I even be listing them at all?</p>

<p><strong>Some context.</strong> I am a PhD student in Mathematics and I will be on the academic job market this coming year.

I am wondering both about the CV I keep that lives on my professional website and the one I hope to send as part of my job applications.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edited to add</strong>: The first couple of answers suggest that one might choose the format/level of detail based on the type/prestige of award. If I were reading a CV and came across inconsistent formatting within a section, I would find it quite jarring. Is this something that only worries someone mildly-OCD such as myself (I notice things like en-dashes and em-dashes) and therefore perhaps to not be worried about, or should I be careful about such things (e.g. consistency of formatting) when creating a CV? </p>

Is having a personal blog that addresses controversial political topics possibly damaging to an academic career?,"<p>I am a Ph.D student, and I've been considering for some time starting my own blog as a hobby, to write mostly on philosophical/political topics that interest me; these are definitely <strong>not</strong> related to my field of research (at least, not most of them). As it happens, some of the topics I want to address are controversial, and much of what I would write could be interpreted as being offensive to one group or another.</p>

<p>Let's assume I want to look for a tenure-track position, and later on get tenure. Ideally, I hope everyone would agree that such a personal blog should not alter in any way my case for obtaining the position. In practice, I am concerned that the existence of such a blog could be used to attack my case for the position (and later on, my case for tenure) on the grounds that the opinions therein found are ""offensive"" or even ""hate speech"" (as might be interpreted by some very sensitive people in these modern times). More subtly, one imagines it could cause some decision-making persons to develop an effective bias against me, which would probably have a negative effect.</p>

<p>Thus my question in the title. I am looking both for personal experiences that people have had, and for some statistical data that may answer the question or a closely-related one (such as, does non-trivial political participation affect academic career? etc.)</p>

Is gift authorship for PhD advisors rampant in academia?,"<p>I have had an issue with my PhD advisor where they were essentially attempting to coerce me into inappropriately adding them as a co-author on a paper that they had no part in. They agreed that they should not be an author according to ethical standards, but essentially threatened me that there would be ""problems with my graduation"" if I did not add their name to the paper. They have refused to collaborate with me on this paper as well as any future paper because they ""are too busy"" and ""no professors really do research"".</p>

<p>This appeared to be a very serious ethical breach to me, so I immediately went to the department chair to describe the situation, and started looking for a new PhD advisor. However, some of the reactions I got to the situation disturbed me. The chair of my department openly stated that all of my research is ""owned"" by my advisor (whatever that means) and implied that I was a bad student for not adding my advisor to the paper. He even went so far to suggest that I add my new advisor's name to the (finished) paper in order to start off on good terms! Another professor trivialized the problem, stating that compared to what many PhD students have to deal with gift authorship is ""not that bad"". A third professor stated that it was clearly unethical, but that it was unfortunately the norm.</p>

<p>It seems to me based on this small sample size (as well as hearing other PhD student's experiences) that gifting authorship to uninvolved PhD advisors is rampant. This is obviously a terrible practice. Is this behavior really rampant in academia? And if so, what happens to PhD students who refuse to participate in this practice?</p>

<p>A further point about my situation: I am in a theoretical scientific field where there is no lab, etc., so there is no complications arising from that sort of thing. Although even if I were working on a grant and using lab equipment gift authorship would be unethical. </p>
",133715,23-07-2019 19:03,Is it ethical for advisors to automatically coauthor papers?,"<p>I work in a field (Philosophy) where co-authorship is uncommon and advisors and grad students very seldomly co-author a paper. I've seen a lot of posts on Academia.se though about the ethics of co-authoring papers with mentors, such <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/19319/is-it-better-to-submit-a-paper-to-an-important-journal-without-the-supervisor-na"">as this question.</a></p>

<p>My sense is that it must be somewhat common in the natural sciences for the head of the lab/dissertation advisor to be automatically added as a co-author to every paper that his or her graduate students produce. </p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this really common, and if so, in which fields?</li>
<li>Is this really ethical? </li>
</ul>

<p>My view is that adding your name to something that you had no part in creating is just plagiarism: it's taking credit for the work of others. </p>

<p>The opposite argument, that the work wouldn't have been possible without the PI's grant funding also cuts no ice. I wouldn't have been able to write my dissertation if my parents hadn't had sex, but that doesn't mean they should get credit as coauthoring my work. </p>

<p>That's the way it seems to me, but maybe somebody from these fields can give us a better rationale for (what seems to be) the widespread practice.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
Another argument against the practice. Suppose I'm a billionaire who knows nothing about science, but I take it into my head that I want to be (regarded as) a famous scientist. Suppose I just spend billions of dollars to fund other people to do research. But, I ask each of those people to come and report to me for fifteen minutes ever week about what they've worked on, or discovered that week. Then, every time one of them finds a result, I demand that my name be added to the paper as a co-author, since we have ""discussed"" the work in progress and it is, after all, by my grace that the funds for the work have been provided. Suppose I just have hundreds of these postdocs, producing thousands of papers a year, all of which I am a coauthor for. </p>

<p>Now ask yourself if I really deserve to be regarded as a famous scientist at all? It seems to me that I don't, because I haven't done any of the science--I haven't suggested any research methods, I haven't designed any experiments, I haven't collected any data, I haven't even helped junior researchers know the shape of the existing literature. You might regard my existence as good for science in some sense--you might think of me as a beneficial patron of the sciences. But you wouldn't think of me as a scientist, right? And you wouldn't think I deserved to be considered for a Nobel Prize, or membership in the American Academy of the Arts and Sciences, or whatever. If I demanded that I be given those awards because of the thousands and thousands of papers that I have coauthored, which have been cited tens of thousands of times, you would call me an idiot, right? We give those prizes for discovery, not for being rich. The same thing is true of tenure too. You shouldn't be able to buy your role as a tenured professor. You should have to prove that you, personally, are capable of making a serious contribution to your field. And of course you demonstrate that capability by publishing papers.</p>

<p>So when a prof is automatically added as a coauthor to a paper that he or she did not contribute to in any way except financially, then she is trying to <em>buy</em> a reputation as a scholar, or the other perks like tenure or membership in the AAAS that come with that reputation in just the same kind of way that the absurd billionaire is doing.</p>

How does Lecturer in UK compare to other systems?,"<p>I have never lived in UK, I did my graduate studies in the US. I was a postdoc in Europe, but the situation there seemed grim, I applied for a few positions only, one of them was this junior prof job in Germany (in theory, an assist prof equivalent of US ) though I figured out despite it being an assistant professorship, it is somewhere near the lecturer position of USA and a bit post-doc? So definitely not as an assistant prof equivalent of a US system in practice. Perhaps a research leader junior prof position could work better in that sense. But how does it work in UK? Currently I am in my country of origin, to be fair, the work is good, practically Tenured (what I need to do is very minimal to complete the track), there are some opportunities for research that I need to apply to (I am certain some grants would be easy with my background meaning a PhD abroad, if not the more challenging), but the university / department and students lack research vigor in every way And research is all I want to do to be honest, it is not a top notch school, I simply wasn't able to attend to some interviews while I was living abroad for top tier private unis and now positions are canceled, and the top tier state schools require just too much paperwork which might take years. I am happy with the job in certain ways, but it is not fulfilling for me in research and standing.</p>
<p>Now, I see this great fit in UK, at a top university, I know the professors there, it is so fitting to my research line etc. Though I don't know anything about the system and how much job safety there is. It is for about one year only, but with a chance to extend the contract. Now that I have an actual job to lose, and a pandemic, I feel like I could use some more information on</p>
<ul>
<li>where the lecturers stand,  what is the usual timeline,  are people
offered tenure track positions afterwards?  how long it takes?  what
it requires?  How much research is involved? (it implies both
coursework and grad students/research opportunity) etc in the ad.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I have never been confident in just asking for a job, so I saw this ad online (I always only apply through listed ads), but I know many people put ads only after they have their strong candidate. Although I know the prof there I don't want to ask, at the same time I feel a bit uneasy applying if they already have a candidate. How does it usually work? Also, not sure whether they would prefer someone living abroad during a pandemic.</p>

What steps would an amateur scientist have to take in order to get a scientific breakthrough published?,"<p>I would like to know from an academic standpoint on what steps that an amateur scientist would have to take in order to get his/her scientific breakthrough published in a major academic journal/scientific magazine.</p>

<p>Say that this person is outside of academia, he/she has no college degrees, and he/she has stumbled upon a scientific breakthrough by chance after years of doing self-study, research, and experiments with a particular scientific area of study.  Also, say that this person has a job with a modest salary so if they will need to raise a lot of money to get it published, they will have to get it from an angel investor or from crowdfunding. </p>

<p>Although I understand that the odds of such a person coming up with a scientific breakthrough is very slim to none, I still would like to know the process that this person will likely have to follow if he/she wants to get it published.</p>

<p>For example, would the first step be that this person should take be making an appointment with a college professor in order to get a professional opinion on their scientific breakthrough?  If so, what guarantee does the amateur scientist have that this college professor will not try to steal this scientific breakthrough?  Should the amateur scientist insist that the college professor first sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement?</p>

<p>Would the second step be that the amateur scientist meet with another college professor to in order get a second opinion and again have that professor sign a NDA?  What would be the 3rd step, 4th step, etc., etc.</p>

My First Authorship was Turned into a Second Authorship without Informing me,"<p>Early this year, I had a surgery-related study in rats and today I just found out my first authorship got turned into the second authorship in the final manuscript my PI planned to submit. </p>

<p>For the study which was my original idea, I spent a tremendous amount of time in conceptualizing the study, created the protocol and design for the stud (second and third authors also involved in this but not as much as I did), carried out all the animal surgeries and analyzed a part of the data independently (for this study, there were only two results we could get), and wrote the part of manuscripts. </p>

<p>The divided tasks between the first and second author for this project was I did all of the above mentionings, while the second author collected, collaborated with two other pathologists who are going to be the co-authors and wrote the discussion and conclusion section. </p>

<p>But all of a sudden, I was just informed today my PI is making the second author the first author because she spent so much time in collaborating with those pathologists and revising the manuscripts with her (they are very close to each other because the second author works full time but I worked the only parttime). </p>

<p>It was so ridiculous because it was our agreement before that she was in charge of the pathology section for the paper with other pathologist and I was in charge of other results. For the whole revision process, both the third author and I haven't been informed by any mean. And I always thought the manuscript was all done except the pathology part. </p>

<p>I brought up the concern to the second author and she told me she deserved the first because ""I spent as much time as possible with PI in rewriting the discussion and manuscript"" (without letting me know) and collaborate with other authors to put their input into the results which I don't even really need this part to make it published. (Moreover, it was my idea to work with the pathologists and I was the one who assigned her the tasks she needs to do with them). </p>

<p>I am so pissed off now and I would like some advice about my situation. I understand this second author spent a lot of time in revising the manuscript (she is good at writing so we agreed before she would write the discussion and edit the paper) but this was done without informing both first and third authors. And it was all because of me to make the project possible when none of the people including the PI likes the project early this year. I was the one spent every weekend and night time alone (until 10 or 11 pm can you guys image?) to carry out all the trails. I was also the one who analyzed the most important part of the data and gave all the inputs the second author needs to form the paragraphs. Now, what she did was just to put others' opinion (pathologists) into the paper, and remake the figures and table I made, so she and the PI wants to make her as the first author. Please help that this lab is so sneaky and horrible. And the similar sneaky revision happened before already to my work (Fountly, I kept my first authorship that time). I would like to take whatever I can to defend my right as I am done in the lab and I don't care if I will continue research in this field or to make the work unpublished. </p>

How do I get physicists to listen to something that they do not want to hear? (Not a duplicate),"<p>My words are coherent and intelligible. My arguments are valid and sound. It is nonsense to accuse me of being a crackpot simply because you do not wish to hear what I have to say. Please remove the duplicate tag on this post?</p>

<p>I have discovered a mistaken assumption that was made three centuries ago and has somehow been overlooked since then. It is a principle that was initially and remains to this day ""proven"" by a perceptual error. If we put the demonstrations and examples to the test of measurement, it is clear that the principle is mistaken. It has deep rooted effects on almost every aspect of science. </p>

<p>It is actually a very simple problem which makes my task more difficult because I face the argument that the theoretical physics papers I have produced are too short to be of importance. This is nonsense. Bear in mind that there is no restriction on the minimum length of a physics paper and I have discovered that the more material that is available to a person who is determined not to accept something, the more hooks there are available for a confirmation bias to manifest. I have discovered through my attempts that brevity is key to overcoming confirmation bias. There is good reason that there is no restriction on the minimum length of a physics paper. Unfortunately, I have not yet discovered the key to overcoming the cognitive dissonance that confirmation bias quickly evolves into.</p>

<p>My papers have been rejected without peer review more than a hundred times despite having had them professionally edited to ensure that they are properly formatted and error free. </p>

<p>I am censored on every science forum upon which I have tried to post anything related to this in most cases before any discussion has taken place. This post itself is being marked as a duplicate with nonsensical reasoning.</p>

<p>It is bad science to reject a submission without even addressing the presented argument. It is bad science to reject a logical proof without showing that the premisses are false or the deduction flawed. It is bad science to base your beliefs on tradition and ignore and censor any information which might conflict with them. It is bad science to immediately accuse someone of crackpotism the moment they say something which threatens your beliefs. It is bad science to drown someone out with ad-hominem, ridicule and mockery in order to prevent that anyone else might hear what he has to say lest they be open to correct thinking.</p>

<p>This is a very important issue and I am not prepared to give up on it because people would prefer not to hear it. </p>

<p>Once the denial is overcome, this will resolve many of the anomalies that are floating around in the world of physics. Not only that, but many of the worlds greatest minds are wasting time on problems that are a result of this mistaken assumption and once they realise that, their attention can be applied to issues that are realistic instead and this might result in progress the likes of which we have not seen in many years.</p>

While I meet all the minimum requirements to be eligible for admission into all the programs, I am pretty nervous about my first and second-year grades: they are horrific. Now, I know that a lot of people say that freshman performance doesn't really count, but my situation is a bit different from the rest. </p>

<p>When I was first enrolled in an undergraduate program at the university, I studied business. Like many other freshmen out of high school, I didn't care about grades. All I wanted to do was pass my courses and get the degree. In my first year, I did pass all my courses, but my average was below the honors program requirement and the academic office issued me a probation warning. Probation warning caused me to panic a little bit, but it still was not enough to make me a better student. In my second year, I failed a couple of core business courses and I was put on probation as a result. Over the course of two years, I did not meet the class average in any of my classes. The University allowed me to come back into the program after I would have taken the year off, but I decided to withdraw from the institution and reapply into a different program at another university.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I was offered admission into one of the English programs at the university in the town where my parents reside. Since I earned some credits from the previous institution, I was registered as a second-year student. This time I performed much better. My average improved drastically, it increased from mid/high 50% to 79%. I scored above class average in every single course with the exception of one. This was also the year, I was taking a calculus course which pushed me to switch from Honors English program to Double Major in Economics and English after an excellent performance. In the previous academic year (2017-2018), I obtained an 87% average (for that year alone) in English and Economics courses. Right now, I am taking math courses in the summer and some advanced ones in the upcoming graduate year. </p>

<p>Based on my recent performance at my current undergraduate university, I think I have decent chances to be accepted into at least one of the graduate problems. But as I mentioned earlier, my performance at my first university is terrible. How much of a problem do you think my two years in business would cause me if at all? </p>

<p>Thanks </p>

Is it unethical to access journal articles from Torrent websites?,"<p>Getting access to journal articles can be quite expensive, in particular for those not affiliated with some University (even then, it's still expensive, it's just the uni paying the cost...).</p>

"If I appeal an admission decision by a German university at the court, would the department take it personally?","<p>I've applied to a graduate program at a university in Germany and there is relatively clear evidence indicating that they've missed one or even two of my documents in application review based on the responses they've given me. Now they are reluctant to reconsidering my application when I resent the documents to them and explained how those documents mean the reason they mentioned for rejection is clearly not true. This is not a subjective thing and it's completely objective and bureaucratic.</p>

<p>It's stated on my rejection letter that I could appeal the decision at the court and I have their emails where they explained reasons that are in contradiction with each other about those documents, which could help me make the case. I really like that department and want to have the option to go there later in my academic career, but I'm afraid if I take my complaint to the court, the department may develop some level of animosity towards me.</p>

<p>Do you think I should forget about working in that department if I start an appeal process at the court, or could I assume that everyone could just be adults and behave professionally?</p>

Now the school seems reluctant to reconsider the application. What should I do? Is there any real chance of being reconsidered?</p>

<p>Here are some details about the story:</p>

<p>The reason for rejection was mentioned in my rejection letter, and apparently, it was a very objective and quantifiable admission requirement that they thought I don't meet. But that was simply wrong, and they seem to have misunderstood (or even completely missed) one of my documents. It is a university in a different country, and apparently, they misinterpreted the document, which was issued by my undergrad school, and missed important information. I explained the document to them and they responded with a change in the reason, but the new reason in a way contradicts the previous one and it again seems to be about missing the exact same information related to that document. The new reason is also even more objective and almost purely bureaucratic, so I explained the policy of my undergrad university to them and what the information in the document means, but then I did not hear back from them anymore. </p>

<p>What should I do in this situation? So far I've just been explaining to them how there <em>might have been</em> some confusions, but with their most recent response, it seems to me that most probably, they misunderstood my documents, and might have even completely missed one of them! I'm afraid of pursuing this more seriously and directly because the department is one of my favorite departments and I like to keep the option of going there later in my academic career open. </p>

Gifting co-authorship if the topic of research was suggested by my boss?,"<p>This is an update of a query that I had asked few months ago: <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/107717/co-authorship-just-because-a-professor-provides-me-the-employment"">Co-authorship just because a Professor provides me the employment?</a>
In fact I have even adopted some of the suggestions given by @Magicsowon there.</p>

<p>I was advised to make the question to the point, and not include any extra information. This is why I am posting it afresh here with only relevant information and also some new information as the situation has evolved since then. </p>

<p>I have worked as a postdoc in a European university for 6 months. The topic of my research was suggested by my boss and his collaborator, Prof. M. That was their contribution. After that, I went through more than 50-60 papers to find the right paper to build my work on. I have developed the theory and I have finished the computational part. Now, I am writing the paper.</p>

<p>A good analogy would be, it was like going to a conference and there one hears about an interesting problem that deserves serious investigation.</p>

<p>While developing the theory, I sent many drafts containing my derived equations to my main collaborator (my boss), but he hardly commented on them, none useful feedback from him. I do not think he had even read them seriously. Considering that a postdoc is essentially an unsupervised position, and the potential of co-authorship dispute in the future, I sent him a couple of emails asking him to help me with certain aspect of the theory and computational aspect. But, he did not provided any help to me. He had a regular comment during every meeting we had, </p>

<p>""I am aware, I should more actively contribute to the work, but as you can see I am busy with meetings. And I am sure, you can fix this problem.""</p>

<p>Also, he did not gave me sufficient freedom to collaborate with other researchers. So, having no help coming from anywhere, I resigned from the job. I had implicitly mentioned to him as well as to the head of the dept. in my resignation email that I had worked all by myself during the 6 months stay at their department, and also that I can do the remaining work by myself. No objection was raised on that from anyone.</p>

<p>Now, I am writing the paper, and my plan is:</p>

<p>1) Write the paper as a single author under the affiliation of the former department where I had finished almost 40% of the work. I cannot gift co-authorship for my hard work of 6-months to anyone as I did not received any major/minor help from anyone. I have checked, this is consistent with the Vancouver recommendations.</p>

<p>2) I will acknowledge my boss and Prof. M in the acknowledgement section of the paper for suggesting me the topic of research. Note: I had just met Prof. M in a conference for 30 minutes or so, we had general discussion about the topic of research. No specific discussion regarding the work I did, no mail correspondence between him and me. However if I am not wrong, he is the actual brain behind the project, and I had tried to visit him and collaborate with him closely. But my boss did not facilitated that either. Also, note that my boss and Prof. M have worked together in most of their papers in the last 2-3 years. And my boss is the director of a research unit in which Prof. M is a member too.</p>

<p>3) I will also acknowledge the research unit of my boss for funding the research.</p>

<p>Is it fair, honest and sufficient? If the paper is published, can he claim authorship by writing to the editor? I am pretty sure he can almost show nothing about the evidence of the contribution other than suggesting the topic of research, if asked.</p>

<p>And the traces of this problem have off shoot to become another problem. See, <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/111034/acknowledgment-of-funding-and-adding-an-affiliation-in-exchange-of-permission-to"">Acknowledgment of funding and adding an affiliation in exchange of permission to use experimental data?</a></p>

<p>Also, I work with a Professor who is very polite, but also very busy with meetings. My salary comes from the project he administers, so he is the boss of the organization and the project.</p>

<p>For the past four months I have been working on a problem day and night including weekends as I found the problem very interesting and challenging. The theoretical part of the work is complete. It is a ""complete"" solution. He had NO contribution at all in this. Not even a single email exchange. He is too busy with meetings all the time. He is in the department twice a week for two to three hours at a time. I am also managing his master student as he has no time. </p>

<p>He is definitely polite and nice though, but I have not received any input from him other than giving me printed research papers. But he always asked me to give him the PDFs of lengthy derivations which I did. But I am dealing with analytical/numerical Navier-Stokes equation and its variations, so you can imagine how much terse that is. He has the entire theory now with him from my work. He may have been a good researcher in the past but no contribution to this work. And he had no proper publication in the work that I am doing so I am not sure how much he can contribute in writing the paper.</p>

<p>Now remains the numerical part which I believe I can do in next 2/3 weeks. And I have the ability to write the paper by myself when I have the numerical solution.</p>

<p>I talked to him and asked if I can work for him based in another city. He said if it is a week visit, that is fine, but not otherwise. He said it clearly that ""I will not pay you to work somewhere else.""</p>

<p>I still have a cordial relationship with him. No worries on that part. So, I am going to leave the place and the position in a month or two for sure.</p>

<p>So, he gains co-authorship just because he has the authority to provide employment? What should I do? Please help. I could have continued to live in the city though it was little boring for me, provided I was able to get inputs from my collaborator, or if he had given me necessary freedom to collaborate with other researchers, which he hasn't.</p>

Verb plurality when citing paper with multiple authors,"<p>I already wrote a paper draft using inline citations like the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, [12] argues that ...</p>

<p>Here I use ""argues"" instead of ""argue"" because the citation ""[12]"" acts as a singular noun (i.e., the paper), regardless of how many authors that paper has.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, Smith et al. [2018] argues that ...</p>

<p>Must I change ""argues"" to ""argue"", since the subject is plural (i.e., multiple authors)? Or can the phrase ""Smith et al. [2018]"" still refer to a singular paper, meaning ""argues"" is still correct?

I spoke about my research at two conferences; one was a talk, and the other was a poster presentation. My advisor asked me to write up the research in a paper around the second year, which I did. Around the third year, I decided to switch research groups, because of the relationship between me and my advisor going sour, and not having funding from her (I used to work part-time to fund my PhD research).</p>

<p>Once this happened, she withdrew her support from me publishing my paper and ordered that I give up my work to a fellow grad student. I told her, that my manuscript is in its Nth revision, and that I would like to take it to completion as first author. She was dismissive and didn’t offer any comments on my work. I told her, that, should I pass on my work, I would like to discuss authorship issues in advance, which she wasn’t ready to discuss. She ganged up my new advisor against me, and together they forced me to give up my code, results, paper drafts. I had to then leave the university without a degree.</p>

<p>Fast forward couple of years, I receive an email from a student in her lab (the student whom I had to hand over my work to), saying that they are publishing a paper, and have decided I am the fourth author.

Why do academics perform review for free?,"<p>Most of the work involved in producing a journal is done by people paid at <a href=""https://www.comparably.com/companies/elsevier/salaries"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rates higher</a> than most academics, but the those with the rarest skills, those able to review specific scientific articles, provide their labor for free.  In my fairly limited experience most academics are over worked, under paid and not particularly positive about the closed access journal system or shareholding capitalists.  Most reviews are conducted anonymously, so reviewers do not receive direct credit from the scientific community.  Funders (in my limited experience of the MRC at least) care about papers a group author not those they review.  The big journals at least are profitable companies that <a href=""https://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/prices/stocks/summary/fundamentals.html?fourWayKey=GB00B2B0DG97GBGBXSET1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pay dividends</a> to their shareholders, and I presume that if they were unable to get this work done for free they would pay for it, making the academics better off and the shareholders receive less dividends.</p>

<p>Why do so many academics provide this service for free?  </p>

Grad school and pregnancy,"<p>I 'm planning to apply for Masters in Computer Science (Non-thesis). I 'm wondering if both, pregnancy and school, can be managed at the same time. Or is better to wait until I get my baby and then apply for the school. I 'm trying to learn from others experiences.</p>

I'm a female MD PhD student married to a male MD PhD student, and neither of us is going to quit our career. We are both willing to put in the time needed to raise a family. </p>

<p>I'm interested in hearing from the following perspectives (EDITED FOR MORE DETAIL):
(a) For women who had kids while they were in graduate school -- how did you decide on when to have kids? earlier in grad school vs. later? (since pregnancy can be very difficult for some women e.g. severe morning sickness, I think optimal timing could potentially differ depending on if the grad student is male or female.) 
Also, how did you approach being pregnant in an academic environment? (i.e. did anyone harass you as being 'less dedicated'? I know this is not a reason NOT to have kids, but I'm just curious about it. Men who are expecting a child can keep it a secret. Women can't keep it a secret because everyone they meet including total strangers can see that they're pregnant after a certain point.)</p>

<p>(b) For men or women who had kids while they were in graduate school and did NOT have a stay-at-home partner - how did you deal with childcare? Reason for asking: if you have a stay-at-home partner, childcare for the bulk of the day has already been solved. If you don't have a stay-at-home partner, it's a very big issue. 
So - what approach did you take? (e.g. alternating schedules between caregivers? nanny? au pair? daycare? relatives? friends? babysitters?)</p>

<p>This question is different from <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/11421/advice-for-having-children-during-graduate-school"">Advice for having children during graduate school</a>  because the vast majority of those answers are written from male perspectives and from perspectives of people with stay-at-home partners.</p>

Can I resubmit a paper published in a low-ranked journal?,"<p>I submitted my manuscript to a journal (Q4), according to SCIMAGO ranking and unfortunately it got published. I say ""Unfortunately"" because I think it should be submitted to a better journal. Now, is there any way to withdraw this publication? According to my googling, papers published in Q4 journals do not have any weight in CVs for academic positions such as postdocs.</p>
",114433,29-07-2018 22:51,Is it ethical to withdraw a paper after acceptance in order to resubmit to a better journal?,"<p>I think the title asks the question, but once again in more words:</p>

<p>Suppose you submit a paper to a journal and it is accepted by the journal.  By this I mean that the journal tells you that they have decided to publish your paper but you have not submitted or examined final proofs and -- especially -- not signed any paperwork allowing the journal to publish the paper.  </p>

<p>I wonder how people feel about the ethics of deciding not to go through with the publication because you now feel that the paper could be published in a better journal?  This could happen either because of outside feedback you received in the meantime or because of feedback from the referees/editors of the journal itself.  (<b>Added</b>: In case this was not clear, I am assuming that upon submission one was seeking to publish in that journal conditional on not learning that one has ""shot way too low"".)  </p>

<p>As far as I can see, it is absolutely legal to do this, so I am not interested in the legality of it, but rather its ethics and ramifications as an academic practice.  I also think I will get better answers if I do not telegraph my own feelings about this; I will be happy to document them later on.  Let me just say (i) this is a hypothetical question, but (ii) based on my own experience it is not ridiculous that it might be in the interest of the author to engage in this practice, if it happened to be kosher to all parties involved.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: I had previously asked a related question, at the time wondering whether it would be better asked separately.  Based on the way things have gone thus far, I now think it is better to post this followup question separately (not necessarily right away).</p>

How to reply to unprofessional negative review from a journal?,"<p>Some time ago I submitted a paper to a preeminent journal, and yesterday I received the review letter from the editor.
The email contained reviews from two reviewers.</p>

<p>Reviewer 1 has been very professional, and wrote a detailed, constructive, useful report of the main aspects of the paper to improve.</p>

<p>Reviewer 2, on the contrary, did the opposite: he/she just wrote five superficial sentences. <strong>Some of his/her comments are just false, some of them don't make any sense, and some of them are even incorrect in English!</strong></p>

<p>In fact, this reviewer wrote: ""The data of the manuscript are NOT available"", when the truth is that our data file <strong>is</strong> publicly available online! It has always been available before submission, during the submission, and now; we the authors wrote this in the manuscript and in the cover letter. I wonder how it is possible that he/she wrote that!</p>

<p>Regarding the English grammar, I'm very surprised to see such poor usage of the language in this review.
This is one of his/her original comments, for example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How did you use the data to contruct and evaluate the models? I didn't see any mechnism for these purposes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you believe it? This sentence is very scarce and ambiguous, and even contains two English mistakes.</p>

<p>Reviewer 2 did not suggest a decision but just wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This research is interesting, but I have a few concerns</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I cannot explain in detail the comments of Reviewer 2 right now, but I can tell you that most of them make no scientific sense.
I am very surprised and sorry to see that my paper, that my collaborator and I wrote in months of energy and effort, has been treated so unprofessionally, both by Reviewer 2 and by the editor who selected him/her.</p>

<p>The editor’s current decision is ""major revision"". The editor wrote that we should address the flaws of both the reviewers.</p>

<p>Question: <strong>What should I do now?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>How can I communicate politely the issues of Reviewer 2's report to the editor?</p></li>
<li><p>Should I address these non-sense comments in the new version of the manuscript or not?</p></li>
<li><p>I strongly believe this person does not have the skills and knowledge to judge my paper. Can I ask to remove him from the reviewer list?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In my case, the first reviewer had no issues with the paper and suggested only a minor revision. But the second reviewer seems to have not spent too much time on understanding the paper. This reviewer's misunderstanding made the editor suggest a major revision of the paper.</p>

<p>In my response to the reviewer (not sent yet), I used the sentence ""This comment completely misrepresent the methodology described in the paper."" Is this too much?</p>

<p>UPDATE: I am glad to inform you all that after the second round of reviews, the paper was accepted with minor revisions. I followed the general advice given in the accepted answer for this post. Instead of being too defensive, I agreed in my response to the reviewer that the misunderstanding may be due to wording of certain sentences and changed them. Specifically, I used the following sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""There seems to be a misunderstanding about the methodology, which we
  hope to clear through our responses below and by revising the text in
  the manuscript. Contrary to what the reviewer states, ...""</p>

What should I do when a predatory conference will not listen to us and the journal might retract our paper?,"<p>I was in my first semester that <strong>a professor asked me for a collaboration</strong> with someone else. We have started the project but because of Mr. C bad behavior and lack of contribution our professor fired him from the project. 
Consequently, we had published a paper <strong>2 years ago</strong> based on that project. After a few months, we have accidentally found out that the initial draft of the paper in another language has been published at a conference with Mr.C name and his wife on the conference proceeding. <strong>It is worth mentioning that we kept our data and updates of drafts in a shared Dropbox account that Mr. C had access to.</strong> We emailed to the conference and told them to remove the conference proceeding because it had been uploaded without our permission, so they removed it from the conference proceedings. Few days after that the journal that has published our paper sent us an email saying that someone (that we know its Mr. C) told them that our paper has published before and it is a case of a redundant publication and plagiarism. 
Then we have told everything to the journal about the situation. 
Unfortunately, because Mr. C have powerful connections in government he was able to make the conference proceeding available once again! now the conference won't listens to us and they don't answer us. 
The conference proceeding is in another language but the context is about 80% the same as the journal paper that is in English!
We don't know what to do. 
<strong>We did not hear about this case from the journal for 3 months now.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Is it possible for the journal to retract our paper at this point because of the duplication and redundancy or plagiarism?</strong> What should we do?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: The conference website is down known and not available anywhere at the moment but the conference has sent the proceedings to an indexing website which is only available in our native language. Also in that website proceedings can be bought only with the X currency and it is not an international indexing website.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Still, I am scared that there might be a possibility for the journal to retract our paper due to duplication!</strong> <em>Is it possible?</em></p>
",114771,04-08-2018 20:12,What should I do when someone's falsified information based on governmental connections to accuse me of academic ethical misconduct?,"<p>It was about three years ago that I have started my M.Sc. degree. I was a top student at our department. I have graduated with honors and with several journals and conference papers. Everyone knew who I was and I was really popular in our department. In the first year, a supervisor asks me to work on a data that he said the data was his own and he had worked on it along with a draft written originally in another language. The data he had given me was based on a project in our class. Every student had to take part in the project as an assignment. There was a student X.X. he was so bad with me and always showed negative behavior through me. Our supervisor decided to put us on a team to make us friend! eventually, we were the only people that have finished the project and decided to publish it as an article. The calculation made by X.X. was wrong therefore our supervisor had told him that we have to go with my calculations for the journal based on the propositions that I have made. At that point, I have changed many things within the initial draft. With the insistence of Mr. X.X. our supervisor agreed to a conference submission of early stages of our project BUT he said that Mr. X.X does not have to be on the Journal paper because he didn't do any of new calculations and the writing process has been done by our supervisor. Therefore he told me to finalize the project without his name in the paper. Also, he told me that I could be the first and corresponding author because he doesn't have any time to work on the project. So, We have published the paper in English in a reputed journal. It is also worth mentioning that few weeks after we submit the paper to the journal, the conference has emailed us that the abstract along with a text has been accepted in the conference for a poster presentation. Our supervisor has shocked! because the paper that was available in the inventory of the conference proceeding was the semi-final paper in the native (foreign) language and the conference had sent us the final acceptance letter. Our supervisor has sent them an email and explained the situation that the paper that has been sent is not spouse to be online because he does not agree to sent this paper and the acceptance was based on only a poster presentation, not a manuscript text! they said OK and the argument was done.</p>

<p>It was in March that we have found the conference paper have been forged and indexed in the conference proceeding that we said not to publish. This proceeding was indexed after 1 year and a half after the conference! Our supervisor had three other proceedings in this conference and they were published at the time in 2015. BUT the conference paper that Mr. X.X. was working on published in 2018 which obviously they have forged the date. Because I have printed all the proceedings in 2016. I have gathered that Mr. X.X is a son of a very powerful man in a governmental organization. Himself Mr. X.X works in as a government employee and he has many and many connections.</p>

<p>Exactly a week after we saw the proceeding my supervisor has sent emails to the conference explaining that this article has been sent without his permission and we have once told them to withdraw the paper. He has also included the technical report on the paper that have problems. Consequently, they have removed the paper from the indexing website.</p>

<p>Two weeks after this the journal that we have sent our paper contacted us that someone emailed us that this paper has been published in a conference proceeding and the policy of journal said that the translation of such is a redundant publication and it is marked as plagiarism.</p>

<p>We have answered their email that Mr. X.X have forged this paper and sent it to the conference and they had published the paper based on his lobbying and concoctions. We explained that at that moment (April 2018) there was NOT a single proceeding available with that information and we have sent the journal complete information about that. We have told them that Mr. X.X is a very well connected man to the government and everything is possible in this country because it is a dictatorship in a middle east (you guess!).</p>

<p>Since then there was not a single email have came to us from the journal. BUT two weeks ago July 2018 the proceeding have been uploaded once again in the same database with a forged date that indicates it had been uploaded in 2015 !!!!</p>

<p>I don’t know what to do.</p>

<p>This man is very well-connected and powerful within the government.</p>

<p>I am really scared that the journal won’t believe this and someday Retract the paper due to duplication or redundant publication.</p>

<p>I have told this story to my main supervisor who supervised my thesis he told me that Mr. X.X is linked to the dean of our department and it would not have any effect if I told him. Also, the head of our department is a woman that works for his father.</p>

<p>I don’t know what to do, and I am really scared that at this point that I have made this far and took this much effort in order to be an academic and to continue my studies as a Ph.D., retraction of this article with such accusation and falsification ruin my career and my life. Because we can't do anything about the conference proceeding that is not even in English!</p>

Proving authorship when name in publications does not match name in passport,"<p>My full name on passport is Amir Hisham Ahmed Al-Attraqchi (first three names + surname). In my publication, I only used the first and the surname (i.e. Amir Al-Attraqchi). Is it going to be a problem proving the publications to be mine?</p>

my article has been evaluated since 17 months. what do you think about this situation?,"<p>I submitted my article to a journal on 12.01.2016. I asked many times about status of my paper. I have not received a reply from the editor even though my article has been evaluated since 17 months. what do you think about unethical situation?</p>
",90965,16-06-2017 20:30,How can author deal with late reviews?,"<p>Another problem I personally struggle with in peer-review publication process is the situation when review takes really, <i>really,</i> <b>really</b> long. The precise definition of ""long"" is probably very area-specific: for example a paper in Maths will probably took longer to review than one in Physics. Many well-established journals and major publishers, sadly, prefer not to specify the ""rules of the game"" precisely, particularly how long the review process should normally take. Fortunately, I quite often serve as a referee with the very same journals and know the amount of time I am given to write a review. Unfortunately, when I am an author, I do not observe these deadlines to be always met. For example, a notable U.S. publisher would ask a reviewer to send a review in 2 months; but in practice a first review of my paper once took as long as 8 months.</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb, I usually start writing to editors with questions about ""the status of my paper"" in X+1 months time, when X is a deadline time for a reviewer to submit a review. This strategy is not particularly successful &mdash; what I usually get is a recommendation to be more patient. Since there is no ""official"" deadline time announced, there is no formal ground for complaints here.</p>

<p>Of course, such delays lead to a whole bunch of funny situations, particularly if a preprint is put online (e.g., on arXiv) and the results are presented in some conferences. Follow-ups with no official paper to cite, grant applications in which you can not justify by a solid publication, good research but bad bibliometrics or CV, to name just a few. </p>

<p>Could you recommend an efficient way to deal with this problem?</p>

How can I do research mathematics without enrolling at a university?,"<p>My goal is to find the general form for the asymptotic cardinality of a compound arithmetic progression.  I'm not affiliated with a university and I certainly don't have any obligation to continue my research.  However, it is very fulfilling to me.  I spend my time in the library; I study through the books on the shelves and I don't really have anyone to tell me that my efforts are not good enough.</p>

<p>The problem comes in when I realized that if I was stronger in Analytic Number Theory, then I could start to look for the general estimate for the asymptotic cardinality of any compound arithmetic progression, and I'm terribly curious about how it works out.  I am jealous of professional students with academic affiliations, access to reviewers, and journals; terribly.  I admit that and it's a big obstacle.  And I'm envious that they had the opportunity to enjoy more prestigious settings.  I wish I could get a foot hold like that too.  But at the same time I just don't think it's going to be possible for me to be published or be respected on the same level, no matter what I do.  </p>

<p>Is it healthy for me to behave like this?  Or am I being too optimistic in thinking that I have something to contribute that could blossom into graduate level, age appropriate research and/or a funded project?</p>

<p>The point is that I've given up looking for a degree or trying to participate in the research projects of others; it places the burden on them to find a place for me in their work and I'd rather be sharpening my own offering instead of going on a wild goose chase.  Math doesn't require the same kind of budgetary overhead, or anywhere near the same level of oversight as the life sciences.  I don't need a lab.  I don't need dangerous chemicals or expensive equipment, and I don't need a workshop, either.</p>

<p>The other question (of which this was marked as a duplicate) was asked by a much more established individual that already finished a Master's degree and wanted to collaborate on somebody else's research; putting together a CV to apply for a research spot is much easier when there's something to anchor it.</p>

I've always been interested in research, but due to personal circumstances I could never commit a lot of time to working on a research project with a professor, and obviously didn't get a chance to publish anything. Now that I'm more settled and have much more time on my hands, I started getting involved in some open source projects and reading some technical literature (engineering, mathematics) that I couldn't get to before. However, I'd still like to find someone to to collaborate with on a research project who is already established in the field and publishes papers. Part of the reason I want to do that is to be able to eventually apply for a Ph.D. program in a good school, and having publications would be a great thing on my resume.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to find out is how I can work on a research project similar to those graduate students work on as a part of their studies if I'm not a student anymore? Should I contact my old professors from the university? Is it possible to find some ""open research"" team that accepts collaborators from outside? Do I have to do it on my own (quite frankly I'm not sure I can give myself a good enough quick-start)? In short, I'm willing to volunteer my time in exchange for a possibility of publication in the future. Can I do it, and if yes then how?</p>

How to ask an editor to exclude a reviewer when the reasons are personal,"<p>I am submitting a manuscript to a journal. I wish to exclude a colleague from being the reviewer of the manuscript. The journal has a single blind review: authors are known, reviewers are anonymous.</p>

<p>Question in short: The reason for this exclusion request are personal (see below), and I'm not sure I want to expose those reasons. What is the most effective ways to exclude a reviewer whom you don't trust to make a fair judgement?</p>

<p>Personal reasons for exclusion request::</p>

<ul>
<li>We had a couple of harsh interactions. She had criticized me personally, and  had short arguments about our different attitudes
towards publishing, writing and research.   </li>
<li><p>I believe she has already wrote a ""reject"" review on my manuscript (for a different venue).</p></li>
<li><p>To my judgment, she has standards that are uncommon in my research community, and so would judge my work on unconventional higher
standards.</p></li>
<li><p>Her personality, in my view, is harsh and critical (and unpleasant) and so each of her judgments are prone to be more negative than
others, on average.</p></li>
<li><p>She is related to the area of my manuscript (I have cited her manuscript and given her full credit for the work she did), and from
her point of view me publishing the manuscript would, psychologically,
be a personal disappointment, because her related work has not been
published. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong>
1. Can I ask the editor not to send it to her review? </p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li><p>Should I ask the editor for this? Would it benefit <em>me</em>?</p></li>
<li><p>How can I explain my request, and should I explain it?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Notes:  i) I <strong>don't</strong> want to write any of the reasons I listed
above! Because they are mostly <strong>personal</strong>! And would put me in a
very unpleasant situation <strong>psychologically</strong> at least.</p>

<p>ii) I believe that the review process in general is very
<strong>subjective</strong>, and so there is always a way to consider the same work in two opposite perspectives: positive and negative. I believe the
reviewer I want to exclude would highlight the negatives, and diminish
the positives. And recommend a rejection.</p>

<hr>

<p>This question is <strong>different</strong> from:
 <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/27160/sound-reasons-for-excluding-a-reviewer"">Sound reasons for excluding a reviewer</a>,
 because the current question asks how to exclude a reviewer
 <strong>irrespective of the justifications of this exclusion</strong>. In other words, I'm not asking what are ""sound reasons to exclude a reviewer"",
 but rather HOW to exclude her, independent from the existence of sound reasons.</p>

<h2>More details of the difference:</h2>

<p>In <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/27160/sound-reasons-for-excluding-a-reviewer"">Sound reasons for excluding a reviewer</a> the term ""sound"" is probably meant to be an objective term. However I claim that the reviewing process is not an objective process at all. Thus, there are at least three different interpretations of <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/27160/sound-reasons-for-excluding-a-reviewer"">Sound reasons for excluding a reviewer</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What kind of reason would be regarded as sound by the editor of the journal?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Or</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Is there a set of objective reasons that the scientific community views as legitimate to exclude a reviewer?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Or</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What can I, as an author do, to exclude a reviewer, if I think he/she has a grudge against me, irrespective of the objective reality, or the justifications of this act of excluding the reviewer?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The OP has not clarified whether he/she means 1, 2, 3 or another question.
These are all <em>different</em> questions.
I'm asking 3.</p>

<p>There are significant overlaps among the scopes of the papers, and one of the important figures and the related conclusion are almost identical.</p>

No other research group published work in this area+domain. So I can safely say that my previous group is among the first if not the first to research in the application of that particular research area on that particular domain. </p>

<p>Now I find a paper published at an IEEE conference where a major part of its contribution is introducing a system that does something I did in a previously published paper, and it does it in the exact same way and even gives it the same name! </p>

<p>I know that some conferences could accept non-novel contributions. Also the paper talks about other aspects so I find it perfectly fine that this paper has been accepted and published. But what I find annoying is that they do not cite my relevant work which was published a year earlier and fairly visible online; A simple (unpersonalized) search on Google would show up at least three links to my work. </p>

<p>Throughout the whole year, I worked well, and I had a lot of fun with the course. I was close to finishing the second semester of it, and I randomly lost access to the course. I was surprised to find out that they took a some of my assignments (about 6~7), and they flagged me for academic integrity, claiming that I used the answers from an online answer source. Another problem is that because it's so many assignments, they have kicked me out of the course, without me even communicating with them the issue. </p>

<p>My teacher had no idea about this, and she can't do anything about it. She told me to talk to academic integrity themselves. I now have a 0 for the course, and I'm very angry, and I have no idea what to do. I can show them I didn't cheat by answering on the phone any questions they have, and I've already studied for the exam and I plan on taking it, and I'm very confident I can get a good grade. I've also used the knowledge I've learned from the course, and I've created iPhone applications as well as games and other software. </p>

<p>I've left the academic integrity team a message stating that I need to speak with them ASAP, but how can I communicate to them that I didn't plagiarize the work?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I have done some research as to how I present my case, and I found a couple things regarding appeals. FLVS claims that it's so called ""academic integrity"" team is fair and not biased and they utilize a lot of technology to ensure that their claims are as factual as possible, such as www.turnitin.com. I have found a Customer Support number that I can voice my concerns to, so I'm going to present my case to them.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE #2:</strong> After speaking with customer support (see update above), the person on the other line wrote down my grievance in an email, and she sent it to the academic integrity people. I also received a copy of the email. She told me she's sorry for my problem and taht I should expect a call in the next 48-72 business hours. Hopefully I will fix this.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE #3:</strong> We had a long talk with the academic integrity team yesterday, and apparently (I had no knowledge of this) they claim I have copied work from my twin brother Varun from about 20 assignments. Going through these assignments, there seems to be evidence of similar code, but that's because certain instance variables and functions had to be created as per the assignment's instructions, but the overall design of the program is different. They also say that we had the same typesetting (meaning me had him the same spacing and tabs and white space), although we're both very experienced programmers, and we follow the conventional format of tabbing and spacing. I'm most likely going to court :D.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE #4:</strong> This is the best part. After talking we academic integrity before (see above update), we decided to check all of the assignments she flagged and come up with legitimate reasons as to why I didn't cheat on them. After coming up with a long list, we sent an email to the academic integrity people and told them that we came up with a lot of reasons as to why we didn't copy, so she said that she would call us in a couple of days. After 2 days, she sends another email stating that her reasons are legitimate, according to her ""boss"", and that she won't discuss the issue any further. I am now super angry about this, and I have legitimate reasons as to how I didn't cheat. She won't tell me anything, and my teachers haven't returned any of my calls. I really hate FLVS.</p>

I was a novice in academia, only one year post completing my Bachelor's degree, and simply not yet ready for the rigors of professional academia.  I had virtually no quantitative background from my Bachelor's degree, but after my first semester during my Master's program, I became interested in quantitative analysis, and registered for a doctoral level course in quantitative analysis.  I was simply not able to keep up with the course, and I received a C-, and my performance in my two remaining classes for the semester was negatively affected, and I earned a B- and B+.  For my final semester, I got my act together and earned three solid A's, including in two very quantitatively oriented courses.  I went on to pursue a second master's degree in a foreign school where, although by no means as prestigious as the first, I had a 4.0 GPA.  However, I am quite confident that my low GPA of a 3.33 from the first Master's will immediately kill any chance I have of receiving an admissions from American schools, which essentially means that one poor performance five years, at a time when I was an entirely different individual, will forever preclude me from pursuing my life's dreams.  I do not believe that it is in any way immoral to want send the transcript of my second master's degree, which I feel better represents who I am and what I am capable of, though obviously I am well aware that this is not allowed.  </p>

Although it was never clear to me what peer reviewed meant because the papers on there seemed to be well maintained and the ones I have came across has been theoretically sound. Academia stackexchange certainly didn't help in relieving some of those anxieties with people asking if they are ""<a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/26820/can-posting-to-arxiv-ruin-your-reputation"">ruined</a>"" for posting on arXiv. </p>

<p>One can understand my point of view better by considering that in engineering there are well established conferences and list of papers published through those conferences (although not all high quality). Browsing through a list of citations published by engineers, there is a definitive lack of ""arXiv"" related papers. This is exacerbated by the fact that arXiv papers seem to be less applied and more theoretical, ""mathy"", so they are largely hidden from view for the typical engineer. </p>

<p>But from my recent experiences, it seems that a few fairly notable researchers in my field have extensive track record of publishing materials on arXiv. People such as Steven Strogatz who works in nonlinear dynamical systems and John Baez. I have hypothesized in the past that very well established researchers are submitting papers on arXiv instead of science journals because they would like a wider audience, and undergraduate researchers are submitting on arXiv because there is no other venue for them. But of course I am not sure if that is indeed the case. </p>

<p>Now I am currently reading some material published on arXiv by someone who I am not very familiar with. I am still not 100% confident on the ""quality"" of the paper i.e. scientific accuracy of theoretical and experimental results. But I believe that I would be more open to using materials on arXiv in the future if I can understand the motivation behind submitting to arXiv i.e. whether if they are just low quality papers without any other place that accepts them.  </p>

<p>Can someone please offer a break down of some the reasons why one would publish to arXiv?</p>

(I don't work in a field where they seem to be common.)</p>

<p>Why would one be concerned about getting a manuscript on arXiv, if it's already under review with a journal? </p>

<p>Is it because of the long publishing timeline of journals?  (That could explain why computer science &mdash; which publishes much more in conferences &mdash; doesn't seem to do much with them.)</p>

Is there a general way to find or get notified of relevant conferences and meetings in your field?,"<p>Here's the problem: I don't know what are the relevant conferences and meetings for me to potentially attend/present in. Every conference I've been so far has been passed down to me by a much older professor who knows it by experience.</p>

<p>I feel like this is an important topic, and yet all the tools I tried to use to find conferences (such as <a href=""http://www.allconferences.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">allconferences</a> and <a href=""https://conferencealerts.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">conferecealerts</a>) fail to find me relevant things.</p>

The university as long as it's registered with the government / legal doesn't matter. Is that true?</p>
",75493,20-08-2016 08:56,University rank/stature - How much does it affect one's career post-Ph.D?,"<p>What I'm trying to understand is, to what degree does the status/rank of the University (where one completes his/her Ph.D) matter while shaping his/her career after graduation? I would like to know the weight given to one's school in both the following cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>While applying for post-docs/faculty positions in academia</li>
<li>While applying to industrial research labs</li>
</ul>

<p>For instance, I've read on some forums (I can't locate the link now) that while considering prospective applications for tenure-track faculty positions, very few Universities accept a candidate who has completed his/her Ph.D from a lower ranked school having a lesser ""brand"" value, irrespective of the fact whether he/she has published equally original work as his/her counterpart from an Ivy league college. How much truth is in this statement? It would be really great if someone already in academia, either as a newly-accepted faculty or someone on the Faculty Hiring committee could share their experiences/statistics on this regard. I'm simply interested to know the answer, without commenting at all on whether such a practice is justifiable.</p>

<p>Similarly, what about recruitment to internationally acclaimed research labs (like <a href=""http://www.watson.ibm.com/overview.shtml"">IBM T.J.Watson lab</a> or <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/default.aspx"">Microsoft research lab</a>) - what importance do they place on the pedigree of a candidate's college, before taking into consideration what they published ?</p>

<p>I'm personally interested in answers related to the field of Computer Science (theory), but the question is applicable to any prospective grad student in any discipline in my opinion. Feel free to share your personal experiences post-Ph.D in detail, as that would give me (and future viewers of this question) about what its like to carve a career once you are out of school!</p>

Why do potential supervisors not reply to my emails?,"<p>I have contacted so far 5 supervisors for my master program that I want to enroll in ( applications open late September and admission January 2017) . </p>

",76586,09-09-2016 21:13,How to get people to reply to emails and what to make of a no response?,"<p>Most people in research probably have first-hand experience regarding how difficult it is to get some people to reply to emails, e.g. (but not limited to) some reputed professors. It is also difficult to establish how to interpret a lack of response, because the person can be just busy and miss your email (i.e. ""save for later"" then forget about it) or might be purposely ignoring the email. I find the lack of response particularly annoying when contacting a listed ""corresponding author"" about their paper.</p>

<p>I have experienced several extremes: professors who reply within hours (or even minutes!); professors who failed to produce any response at all; even once I sent a job query and didn't get a response until after 2-3 months later, when the professor apologized about forgetting to reply and said he was very interested in my application.</p>

<p>The latter case almost cost me a job (luckily I had already secured a position elsewhere), and as it turned out later I could have resolved the situation by sending the professor a reminder that he had not replied to my earlier email. But how could I have interpreted his lack of response as either forgetfulness or disinterest?</p>

<p>The situation is usually better with postdocs and graduate students, who tend to reply, and when they do their replies tend to come faster.</p>

<p>I know that it is considered unethical to submit to multiple journals at once, but that does mean that the journal has a responsibility to let you know as fast as possible whether the paper is accepted or not.</p>

Does IEEE membership have any value whatsoever on the CV?,"<p>Some CS veterans would probably shoot me on sight for questioning its value, but let's face it, you are a member of IEEE if you're paying them a fee every year, and I don't think there's anything else keeping you from entering if you're in CS/EE. I see every single professor writing it on his CV though, and it is beginning to look like a must-have.</p>

<p>Agreed, you get some (limited) access to papers from their library, and a discount for conferences and the rest of the library, but as a student I can't afford to skip classes to go to conferences (and often I can't afford the travel costs either), and I have few things pressuring me to read papers, if any. In fact I haven't come across a subject with so little material on it with public access that I felt I needed access to other papers.</p>

<p>I'm not denying the existence of people that actually use the papers they have access to, but I am confident that a survey would reveal that not even a quarter of the members access the libraries.</p>

<p>To sum up my points:</p>

<ul>
<li>It only shows that you pay a fee every year</li>
<li>Probably without using anything of what you get for that fee</li>
<li>It just adds a line to your CV that doesn't really say anything about you.</li>
</ul>

<p>So does it have any value? Do people notice this? Is it worth renting a title and nothing else?</p>

<p>That question assumes membership is already active and asks if it is worth mentioning it, however it costs nothing to mention something you already have so the parameters are significantly different. This question questions if it is even worth obtaining the membership, essentially also asking if this (or any) title is worth paying for, given that many others already do so.</p>

<p>Even though some of the answers do make mention of whether it holds any value to those who answered, they do not address if university staff or recruiters pay attention to this, or even how it affects them. One could even see it as renting a title to compensate for lack of other things to write on the resume.</p>

<p>Since these questions (sensibly) come up again and again, I thought it would be useful to have a collection of links to various ethical standards for coauthorship.  To the best of my knowledge, these standards will apply only to one particular academic field and/or to one geographic region.  For instance, most of my colleagues would point to <a href=""http://www.ams.org/about-us/governance/policy-statements/sec-ethics"">this statement by the American Mathematical Society</a>.  It applies (explicitly) to mathematics and (implicitly, I think) to mathematics done in the US and by Americans.  </p>

<ul>

Can I still publish a paper in an IEEE transaction journal after uploading it to the arXiv?,"<p>I read often that preprint servers such as arXiv are changing how we publish. However, no one in my area of medical imaging uses them and they are regarded in my lab with suspicion.</p>

<p>I currently have a finished manuscript that I am about to send to an IEEE transaction journal. I would like a preprint of this manuscript to be publicly available for several reasons. However, my supervisors are worried this might invalidate my ability to publish this manuscript. They don't want to take the risk that I do this wrong and can't publish.</p>

<p>So here is the simple question I never seem to see a simple answer to. Here is a finished manuscript, fully formatted for the journal I am going to submit it to, in PDF. Can I submit this  PDF as a pre-print to arXiv right now, or not? Will the publisher still consider publishing it? To play devil's advocate, why wouldn't IEEE say, this has already been published in the arXiv, it is no longer new work?</p>

<p>Edit: Here is what IEEE says: ""Does IEEE consider an author posting her paper on preprint servers or on her company's web sites to be a form of prior publication, which may then disqualify the paper from further editorial consideration? No. IEEE policy allows an author to submit previously posted papers to IEEE publications for consideration as long as she is able to transfer copyright to IEEE, i.e., she had not transferred copyright to another party prior to submission.""</p>

Is it plagiarism (or bad practice) to cite reviews instead of source material directly?,"<p>My first source of information when preparing a manuscript are reviews. If up-to-date and comprehensive, I feel I can create most of my introduction by rephrasing and citing them. Nevertheless, reviews are based on citing other papers and, with the deluge of literature published these days, finding the source material for a single claim sometimes becomes a never-ending and time consuming play with a Matryoshka doll.</p>

<p>For example, in this review by <a href=""https://mcb.berkeley.edu/courses/mcb230/WEB/PAPERS/mistelli.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Misteli (2007)</a>, the following claim is made and supported citing three papers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The recent development of methods to probe the physical association of
  genome regions in a unbiased and genome-wide scale should lead to
  rapid progress in our still-rudimentary understanding of the
  functional significance of chromatin loops (Simonis et al., 2006;
  Wurtele and Chartrand, 2006;Zhao et al., 2006).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I consider relevant to a point in my article that there are new roads being opened to study “the functional significance of chromatin loops”, To do so, I have three options: </p>

<ol>
<li>Rephrase the sentence and cite Misteli, 2007, acknowledging that I extracted the citation from the review and depriving the authors of the source material of a citation;</li>
<li>Rephrase the sentence and cite Simonis et al., 2006; Wurtele and Chartrand, 2006;Zhao et al., 2006  <strong>without reading the three source papers,</strong> which is kind of deceiving but at least acknowledges the authors of the research and not the author of the review; or </li>
<li>Read the original articles, rephrase and cite Simonis et al., 2006; Wurtele and Chartrand, 2006;Zhao et al., 2006, which is the most “honest” option but incredibly time consuming.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sometimes, if I decide to do 3, I may find myself spending a lot of time reading, only to write something that was already said in the review. </p>

<p>Which option you would abide for? Am I somehow plagiarising the reviewers or primary authors if using any of my strategies? In terms of ethics and good scientific conduct, which is the best option? How deep and when should I look for source material?</p>

<p>I am not asking about which version of an article to cite, <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/5964/choosing-which-version-of-an-article-to-cite"">like here</a>. I assume that versions cited in reviews are the most up to date. I am asking when it is correct to cite the review or the primary source found in such review.</p>

<p>Note: My strategy up to this days is a mix of 1 and 3: search and cite the source material only if the paper is relevant for the core of my article and cite the review when filling the generals.</p>

How to deal with procrastination issues,"<p>As a graduate student I switch between many tasks during each week. My activities consist of attending classes, doing homework, grading, working on my research and studying for exams. However I notice that from time to time I tend to procrastinate <strong>and this happens mostly</strong> when I have to switch from one task to another or when I feel that a task is difficult and I am not yet sure of how to handle it. It also may occur when I work at home in Sundays or when unexpected lab meetings interrupt me from my schedule.</p>

<p>My situation is not that I do not feel productive, but some hours per week can be lost due to this issue (which is an important thing).</p>

<p>In general the main idea of my problem is: I tend to procrastinate when switching tasks.</p>

<p>To protect me from distractions I have installed browser plug-ins that do not allow me viewing distracting websites more than 5 minutes per day.
I also try to keep track of how much time I spend on each task and have established a relatively stable weekly program.</p>

<p>However I believe I could benefit from better time management advices to handle procrastination...</p>

<p>What are your suggestions ?</p>

<p>p.s. Sometimes what also takes time, is communicating with family and friends. I am an international student and I dont want to lose touch with my people. Although I have a relatively steady pattern of communication with them (usually within weekends) nostalgia beats me wanting more discussion.</p>

Most answers seem to suggest micromanagement time approaches.
However I believe that micromanagement tends to take a lot of time too.

What criteria are used to rank graduate programs?,"<p>I'm only asking this out of curiosity since I've seen posts/discussions about getting into &quot;top&quot; graduate programs etc. This mentally (wanting to get into a &quot;top&quot; ranked program) makes sense (depending on one's priorities) for undergraduate study, since the selectivity is what gives the degree its &quot;prestige.&quot;  This may also hold true for law or medical school programs where rankings may reflect the level of training one receives and/or directly affect internship/residency opportunities etc. However, I'm not sure how this would apply to a research degree.</p>
<p>For example, in masters or PhD research programs, you're applying to conduct research under the auspices of a specific advisor. Thus, it seems that alignment of research interests and personal compatibility should be prioritized over &quot;rank&quot; of the program. Obviously one still has to meet certain admissions criteria regardless of the program they're applying to, but it doesn't make sense (to me anyway) to rank/judge research oriented graduate programs the way one would an undergraduate or &quot;professional&quot; program (i.e medical or law school etc).</p>
<p>Also, will the quality of one's graduate education or future academic career opportunities be affected by the rank of the program?

I would like to know the weight given to one's school in both the following cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>While applying for post-docs/faculty positions in academia</li>
<li>While applying to industrial research labs</li>
</ul>

<p>For instance, I've read on some forums (I can't locate the link now) that while considering prospective applications for tenure-track faculty positions, very few Universities accept a candidate who has completed his/her Ph.D from a lower ranked school having a lesser ""brand"" value, irrespective of the fact whether he/she has published equally original work as his/her counterpart from an Ivy league college. How much truth is in this statement? It would be really great if someone already in academia, either as a newly-accepted faculty or someone on the Faculty Hiring committee could share their experiences/statistics on this regard. I'm simply interested to know the answer, without commenting at all on whether such a practice is justifiable.</p>

<p>Similarly, what about recruitment to internationally acclaimed research labs (like <a href=""http://www.watson.ibm.com/overview.shtml"">IBM T.J.Watson lab</a> or <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/default.aspx"">Microsoft research lab</a>) - what importance do they place on the pedigree of a candidate's college, before taking into consideration what they published ?</p>

<p>I'm personally interested in answers related to the field of Computer Science (theory), but the question is applicable to any prospective grad student in any discipline in my opinion. Feel free to share your personal experiences post-Ph.D in detail, as that would give me (and future viewers of this question) about what its like to carve a career once you are out of school!</p>

How may a young scholar without tenure change their field of research?,"<p>So let me elaborate on this question a bit with an imaginary scenario: John is a young, recent Ph.D. graduate in computer science. During his Ph.D. he was mainly concentrating on network science and algorithms, but he has developed a deep interest in computational social science, a <em><strong>related but not that closely related</strong></em> field. He wants to get deeper into this and even perhaps change his primary area to computational social science, but he may not be prepared for this. He has read sufficient materials and research work about this, and the required technology/math for him is not difficult, but he hasn't done any real research on this subject.</p>
<p>So in this scenario, what should a young scholar like John do if he/she is really dedicated to making some contributions? Please note, that we are talking about a young scientist, not a tenured professor who has much more freedom.</p>
<p>A postdoc is certainly an option, but how likely is John getting a postdoc position since it's not his primary research area?</p>
",153694,08-08-2020 23:54,Is just after your PhD a good time to switch your research area?,"<p>I am finishing my PhD soon. The area in which I pursued my PhD is very challenging as I was only able to publish couple of papers even after spending many years. I want to switch into other research are due these reasons</p>

<ol>
<li>to attract more students </li>
<li>to be comfortable to do research (along with teaching, I should be able to do research)</li>
</ol>

<p>Even though I like the research I am doing right now, I seem to be isolated in my university. If ten students join my university for a PhD, hardly one student takes this area. My research area is not like machine learning or deep learning etc, so researchers of my domain are also not that much interested in my work. </p>

<p>The thing is I can work different research area but: <strong>Is this the right time?</strong> I am heading to a post-doc and learning a new area will probably take several months. Although my switch is not 180 degree, I am still worried.</p>

I am also applying to graduate schools this semester, will this impact me?

Peer-review in ‘fully peer-review journals’,"<p>If, after 28 months of waiting and the third request, I within a few hours receive “Reviewer # 1: Sorry that this review took so long. However, this paper does not contain any results of value”, I know that the referee read only the author's name and, possibly, the title of the article.</p>

<p>If I get the message ""How about you try to establish a reputation for yourself on several less serious questions before claiming to solve * both * the Goldbach and Twin Prime problems?"", Then I begin to think that the solution of these problems is reserved for the author of this message And he was promised to show “the Book"". Is it ethical to give such advice?</p>

<p>If they write to me “Yes, I will not accept this work. ... From very general considerations, I believe that you have a mistake in your work. Formally, of course, I have to specify it, but I do not want to do it because of saving my own time”, I understand that they read the work, they did not find any mistakes and  refuse, just in case. </p>

<p>Of course, the referee can save two hours of his time, and as a result, the author loses months, years, and sometimes, and all his life.
Obviously, in order to recognize the results of my work, courage is needed.
But, if “Reviewers' comments: ... I suggest rejecting it on grounds that it does not meet the standards of mathematical correctedness practiced by our journal”, I do not understand what is more important, form or content. I’ve always believed that the result is more important.</p>

<p>Sometimes they refer to feelings (“the referees felt given the methods you are using, it is hard to imagine that the results you claim are valid”), or belief (“I'm sure that your ""elementary evidence"" of Goldbach and the twins have mistakes, many years of experience does not allow me to believe in them, but I also can not spend time searching for them”). </p>

<p>But I'm not interested in the feelings of referees who did not even get acquainted with the proposed method and, I did not ask anyone to take my word for it. I offer the proof.</p>

<p>This is only part of the disclaimer, but there is not a single review or indication of an error.
Is it ethical for judges to make a conclusion about a job without reading it, but only on the basis of their feelings and assumptions about what is written in the article? </p>

<p>Is every referee a priori smarter than any author to such an extent that in several phrases pulled out of context, can determine where the author's thought can turn? 
Should not the referee read the article at least until the first error and point to it? And if the error is not found, recognize the work as correct. Otherwise, he should declare himself incompetent and ask the editor to transfer the article to another referee

<p>I now want to apply for a PhD in ML / NLP from colleges like Carnegie Melon or N NUS, Singapore. But I find I don't have enough recommendation/ work experience in the same field.<br>
What should I do - <em>Personal projects in these areas? Personal publication? Working with a startup in these fields ?</em><br>

"Refereeing a lazy, but correct paper","<p>When refereeing a paper, I often have objections to the work that do not rise to the level of using the coercive powers of a referee to delay or reject the work. For instance, I find myself wanting to write: ""If I were you, I would be embarrassed to publish a paper with [such unclear writing/such a silly comparison to experiment/so few parameters studied/incredibly ugly figures].""*</p>

<p>If the paper is not <em>wrong</em> or incoherent, just lazy or badly written, I don't feel justified in rejecting the paper or requiring a revision. I also don't want to invest hours of time acting as a language editor or graphic designer for figures. </p>

<p>Is there a politer way to express this sentiment and encourage the authors to improve their own work? Or should I simply take on good faith that the authors have done the work to the standards they are willing to publish, and that these may differ from my own?</p>

<p>*note: this is distinct from the case where the paper is so unclear that you can't tell whether their work is correct or not - where I think rejection is appropriate. I'm also assuming that this is not a terribly selective journal - in fact, it could be a journal like PLOS ONE, which explicitly says that importance to the field is not a relevant criterion. </p>

<p>Often in my field I review papers from researchers in Asia (reviews are not double blind) which are poorly written. By poorly written, I don't mean that the prose is not pleasing to the eye, that there are problems with how the writing flows, or that there are innocuous typos or spelling mistakes. Instead, the grammar used by the authors differs seriously from normal English, and often produces significant changes in the <em>meaning</em> of sentences.</p>

<p>Usually such papers are ultimately readable, but one has to go back and re-read sentences or paragraphs several times to infer the meaning (and this is with strong knowledge of the research area!), so I generally won't reject a paper solely for this reason.

which I will refer to as the ""original paper,""
and the paper which I am now refereeing is an extension of the original paper,
which I will refer to as the ""extension paper.""</p>

<p>I have found that large portions of the extension paper
are copied from his original paper.
In particular,
a whole section of definitions is copied from his original paper;
and some paragraphs in the introduction and literature review
are copied wholesale or with slight modifications from the original paper.</p>

<p>Is it acceptable for an academic paper to copy paragraphs and even a section from an earlier paper by the same author?</p>

<p>My intuition suggests that it is acceptable to copy the definition section,
with an acknowledgement that it came from the original paper,
since definitions are standard.
But it seems strange to me for the introduction and literature review
to be too similar to the original paper.</p>

Does reusing my own code from one project to an other count as plagiarism?,"<p>I am currently a under graduate and will be going into my final year of a Computer science course in October. </p>

<p>The final year consists of a large programming project. Over the last 6 months I have been working on ideas for the project. To the point where I have a nearly finished application. </p>

<p>If I was to use large chunks of code that I have written over the last 6 months in the project would this count as Plagiarism? It doesn't feel right been able to just copy and past code to get a head start on the project even though I had written the code in the first place.</p>
",91830,07-07-2017 14:26,"Is reusing old code for a new assignment considered self plagiarism? How to protect yourself if you consider it to be, and a group partner does not?","<p>I am taking a graduate machine learning course and am working with another student in the class on a final project. In his undergraduate studies, the other student wrote code that accomplished a similar task, and mentioned in our previous meeting that we would be able to leverage much of this code for our current project if we wanted to. I responded that I believe it would constitute textbook cheating and self-plagiarism, but the other student disagrees and believes that re-using the code would not constitute self-plagiarism because he himself wrote it, and it would be redundant to re-write what he had already done.</p>

<p>Now, the course instructors have made it clear that we are not allowed to use any external libraries to perform certain classes of algorithms for this project. This students' prior code would fall under this category of prohibited tools, but he claims that it doesn't qualify because he wrote the code himself (so it is not an ""external library""). I believe this is hyperbole, but he disagrees. It is also worth mentioning that this code is licensed under an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License"">MIT License</a>, though it is not widely used at all.</p>

<p>It has gotten to the point where I am uncomfortable going forward with the project by re-using his old code, and he does not want to do work on the project that he considers to be redundant. My worry is that if it turns out we're not allowed to reuse the code, then using it could cause us to fail the course and severely negatively affect our reputations. Even if we don't get caught, I personally feel that it would be unethical to copy-paste old code and present it as though it's fresh code for this current project.</p>

<p>I am unsure of how to proceed. I have tried reaching out to the professor of the course some time ago (she has been traveling for some conferences recently and will be for a while) but I have not heard back from her. Additionally, the course TAs have been unwilling to weigh-in on the situation.</p>

<p>I have the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is the above situation usually considered to be self plagiarism? Why or why not?</li>
<li>Is the above act typically allowed in an academic setting?</li>
<li>Assuming you are in my position, and consider re-using the code to be cheating and/or unethical, what is the best way to proceed; both in terms of how to make progress on the project, how to compromise with my group mate, and how to protect myself if my group mate refuses to budge.</li>

How to finish PhD and get through the academic job market as a new mother and primary caregiver?,"<p>I am a female graduate student in a competitive phd program.  I recently had a baby.  Although this is a planned pregnancy, and I thought I had thought through the complications having a baby would bring, I am still very overwhelmed by how much different my life is now.</p>

<p>I don't have any time besides taking care of a newborn, and I am very sleep-deprived.  Baby's dad works full-time to support the family.  Even though it brings me a lot of joy, I just can't help but wonder whether I would ever have time for my research again.  I initially planned to go back to school in September, when baby will be about 3 months old.  But I am not sure whether I would be able to do anything next semester.  Or even the semester after next.  I initially planned to graduate next fall, but now I feel that might be a stretch.  The application starts next semester, and I should be going around giving talks and preparing for my applications.  But that feels impossible now.</p>

<p>And there is the financial stress.  I want to put my child in daycare at some point (like around 7,8 months), so I can have some time to do work.  But it's very expensive, and I don't know if we can afford this with our current income.  Sometimes I thought about finding an industry job after graduate school, so things would be easier.  But I don't want to give up research.</p>

<p>What is an effective way to deal with the stresses of being a new mother while on the job market? Specifically, how can I complete my research and apply to jobs in a situation where I am sleep deprived and child care is expensive?</p>

Especially at infant stage, mother's role cannot be placed by others due to constant feedings.  The author in the other post also has his girlfriend/wife staying at home with the baby, so there will be much less work for him.  In my case, I would be the one taking care of the baby since my husband works full-time.  Another thing is I am already at the stage that I am about to graduate as opposed to the other post is debating whether to start the program, so I am more concerned about the graduation timeline.  </p>

On the other hand, I do not work for them anymore, and my current company has very little interest in my old field of research, and probably will not support it financially, but I think it is wise to mention them as well.

Declining a PhD offer after accepting?,"<p>I'm having a bit of a dilemma currently. Basically I applied (with my own research proposal) to three universities for a PhD. Whilst I was accepted at all three, I got no offer for funding from one, placed on the reserve list for funding for another, and offered funding for the third. </p>

<p>The university I was placed on the reserve list for was basically my dream university to go to for a PhD but after hearing nothing for 2 months I accepted the offer from the other university. I accepted about two weeks ago and have spoken to the people who will be my supervisors and they're both lovely people. </p>

<p>However, this evening I received an email from my preferred university offering me full funding. Obviously I would love to accept but I don't know how bad it looks to reject the other offer now? I would feel terrible, but one of my main concerns is also that people say the academic community is very tight-knit and obviously these academics all research a similar topic. I want to work in academia following my PhD and wouldn't want to start this career already having academics not a fan of me! </p>

In the meanwhile I have managed to secure a PhD offer from another 2 universities much better in world rankings and with better research groups and better faculty. Additionally these 2 universities do research exactly on what I want to devote my PhD research.</p>

<p>My only commitment to the first university is a mail confirming I accept. Nothing else. I understand declining the offer after already having accepted it is quite dishonest but it is a huge decision that will affect my future in a very significant level. </p>

<p>I would like your opinion and I would also like to ask for possible consequences of such an action. As far a postdocs concerned, in the first university there is no chance I ever get a postdoc since they do not actually do research on my area (except for the prospective supervisor and even he not as much).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
I have decided to do as I was afraid to. I have decided to choose a different university than the first one that I have already accepted the offer. My offer acceptance included: </p>

<ul>
<li>An online ""I accept"" statement.</li>
<li>An e-mail I sent stating ""I accept the scholarship and this University is my first option""</li>
</ul>

<p>I do not have any legal commitments since I have not signed anything. The supervisor of the first university though is really nice to me and continuously was sending me mails. <strong>How do I very nicely tell her I will not be joining in the end?</strong> Additionally the place I will go in the end will be for research in Mathematics and not Physics. Can I use this as a part of a sensical excuse?</p>

<p>I think that I should let people, especially other beginning grad students know what happened with my case. I have chosen to nicely tell the first university I got accepted that I will not be attending and will not be pursuing a PhD there since I decided I have different research interests (which is true). I had applied there in the first place since I was not sure what I wanted to do and because it was a nice program. Despite that, I got an offer from a World top university to work on 100% my research interests. I explained this to them, the first uni, and they happily let me go and wished me good luck, especially the supervisor who faught a lot secure me funding. I was lucky.</p>

<ol>
<li>Whether they'd be looking for new students at all in the coming year?</li>
<li>If they did, would they be potentially interested in my profile (I know no-one would guarantee an acceptance without me going through the process of application), but it would help to know if they <em>would not be interested at all in me</em> - which would leave me  free apply to other schools in which I get a neutral/positive response.</li>
</ol>

<li>What should be the salutation - I know ""Respected Sir"" sounds archaic, but was wondering if ""Dear Professor X"" sounded too informal or not!</li>
<li>Do I state my credentials (details of where I did my undergrads/masters) first, or do I state my purpose in writing to him/her?</li>
<li>How to mention my background concisely, without giving too much details, while at the same time not ""underselling"" myself as a potential grad student?</li>
<li>I want to give a link to my resume/profile hosted on my website - should I embed the hyperlink, or is it better to write the link in plain text?</li>
<li>How do I end such a letter - the obvious ones (such as ""see you soon"" or ""till we meet again"") being not quite suitable in this case)?</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm basically afraid of saying too much (causing vexation) or too little (resulting in no response to my missive). I understand that the faculty are accustomed to seeing their inbox flooded with such mails each year, few of which ever get a positive response - which may not always be due to lack of an interesting profile, but the manner in which the mail is worded (<em>Many</em> professors have explicitly mentioned on their websites that they would not respond to generic <em>""Do you have funding""</em> type of queries no matter what the credentials of the student are!). </p>

<p>Though my interest is specific to CS, I believe it would apply to other fields as well.

Does taking FF from a not included piano course have any effect on my application to Phd?,"<p>I'm a second year Physics(Major) and Mathematics(Double Major) student and in this summer term I'm taking a piano lecture as <em>not included</em>, i.e it doesn't have any affect on my CGPA and taking FF or NA from it doesn't have any penalty.However, due to some problems with the instructor, I will not attend the final exam, hence I'm going to either take NA or FF.</p>

Correcting a thesis after publication,"<p>I defended my PhD thesis over 5 years ago and obtained my PhD, but I was not happy with the thesis (a classic saying of many an academic, I know), but felt pressured to submit and move on to new things.

"Specifying a preprint is ""submitted"", *to a specific journal*","<p>There are some mathematicians who are active online and who blog about their work at various stages, including when they upload a paper to the arXiv. I like this aspect as it gives a chance for the author to give a more informal explanation as to how the results were arrived at or how to interpret them. However, I've seen a few times they they say, on their blog or in the arXiv comments, that the paper is submitted for publication (which is perfectly fine), but additionally specify exactly which journal it has gone to. </p>

<p>As these mathematicians are in fact well-respected and solid in their career I do not wish to impugn their decision, but it smacks of me of being rather confident that the journal will accept the paper, after some small revisions. Since the refereeing process in mathematics takes months, at a minimum, and up to a couple of years in more involved cases, the statement that the submission is to a particular journal will stand for a long time before we know either way as to the result.</p>

<p>As a early career researcher I wouldn't presume to proclaim the journal I think my work should be published in. But am I selling myself short? Let us say I am reasonably confident the paper I am submitting is a good fit for the chosen journal, should I also stake my claim during the preprint phase, to signal at least how ""good"" I think my paper is? (which judgement people can then assess based on their own experience)</p>

<p>Edit: I see the answers at the previous similar question, while acknowledging the practice to be field-dependent generally warn against this behaviour. However I am observing a career-stage-dependent behaviour in my field contrary to those good suggestions, weighted towards those who already have some advantage (to borrow from Dan Romik's example, imagine Bob could always carry through on his promise, never overstepping the bound on what had actually been done). </p>
",94531,14-08-2017 08:38,"Drawbacks of making public which journal a manuscript is submitted to, while it is under review?","<p>Many researchers list out their submitted manuscripts on their website. Some specify the journal name, like</p>

<p>while others don't, like</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Smith J, Oliver J (under review) My awesome paper.</p>

<p>One reason I can think of as to why some don't mention the journal name is that they may get embarrassed in the case where the current journal rejects the paper. Then, the ""circle"" will know this paper gets rejected from <code>Nature</code> first and then ends up in an inferior journal.</p>

<p>Besides this, are there any other considerations preventing people from mentioning to which journal they submit a paper to?</p>

<p>P.S.: I am asking because my advisor is a researcher who only mentions accepted  papers on his webpage. As a student hunting jobs, I feel it is advantageous for me to mention my submitted papers on my webpage. I hesitate to do so, as I worry I may make my advisor unhappy by announcing in which journal our papers are currently under review.</p>

",94879,22-08-2017 04:22,Points to remember when having to write recommendation letter yourself,"<p>While it is an unethical academic practice, it is a fact that most recommendation letters for MS degrees in US and Europe from countries like India and China are written by students themselves. Students apply en masse; the faculty strength in departments in many universities is small; the few professors hardly get the time to write recommendations for all applying students. Moreover a 4-year engineering degree is dominated by coursework and professors are unlikely to get to know students outside the classroom. </p>

<p>Let us set aside the question of whom to blame for this practice and look at the question that comes up on most applicants' minds: </p>

<li>""In the event that I have to write a recommendation letter on my own, what are the points I need to bear in mind?"" </li>

<li>maturity of presentation and avoidance of blandishment</li>
<li>Creating tonal differences among different recommendation letters.</li>

Using reference as a subject in writing,"<p>Is it acceptable to use references as a subject in a sentence (in the context of academic writing, preferably in computer science)?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An extensive research has been done on eye capture by [Bérard
  et al. 2014].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Versus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An extensive research has been done on eye capture by Bérard
  et al. [Bérard et al. 2014].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel like it removes tautology and makes the text easier on eyes. Moreover, I have seen published papers where authors write like this (although not many). However, it is considered to be bad style by a couple of people who I have asked. Their reasoning is that a reference should be an additional information and if you remove all references from the text, the text should still be complete and make sense. I understand this reason, but I feel like there are no real cases when this can be needed.</p>
",94992,24-08-2017 08:22,Can cited works hold grammatical positions in sentences?,"<p>Though I read this style quite often, I was recently told unambiguously by a reviewer that I was NOT supposed to use citations ""as if they are objects in a sentence.""  The following sentence is an example of what the reviewer considered unacceptable:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We analyzed the data using the Wilmerding method, guided by [12].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The references section might include the following: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[12] Smith, D., Marshawn, J., &amp; Devenshaw, A. 2011. <em>Techniques and
  Procedures for Applying the Wilmerding Method.</em>  Prince Publications,
  Inc, New York, NY.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Wilmerding method<sup>1</sup> is not a step-by-step algorithm that can be precisely followed as if by a machine, and thus [12] does not provide a step-by-step algorithmic description but rather guidance for using  the method. [12] is a relatively slim but authoritative textbook about how to use the Wilmerding method.</p>

<p>Within this question, for the purpose of discussion, I have intentionally put [12] in grammatical positions where it's an important element of the sentence and the sentence would make less sense without the reference.  Sometimes that seems to be the most efficient way to communicate the intended message.  <strong>Is using a reference as a grammatical sentence element like this OK?   Why might this not be considered acceptable?   Should I be rewording those sentences?  Is it enough of a violation to be worth passing the note on to authors of papers I review?</strong> </p>

<p>I considered posting this on <a href=""http://english.stackexchange.com"">EL&amp;U</a> but it seems more specific to academia than general English usage, and the comment came from a content reviewer rather than a copy editor.  <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/36624/is-it-acceptable-to-include-author-names-as-a-substantive-part-of-a-sentence-as"">This question</a> is related but it seems to be more about when to put authors names' in vs. outside of the parentheses in an APA-like style. </p>

I am taking my last year and a half (with 5th year) of classes. I transferred to UC Davis from UC Santa Cruz for my junior year; I completed lower div bio, gen chem, ochem, physics, and calc at UCSC. These are my projected gpa breakdowns:</p>

<p>GPA:
Overall gpa: 3.312 (upward trend)
Overall major gpa: 3.200 (upward trend)
UC Davis major gpa: 3.705 (upward trend)</p>

<p>EXPERIENCE: (in process of/completed) 1 first author &amp; 2 coauthor papers:
I have worked in a cognitive neuroscience lab since summer after freshman year at UC Davis, total I will work there for 5 years upon completing my 5th year. I am the coauthor of a paper soon to be published, am in the process of creating an experiment I will be a first author on, and will be a coauthor of another paper my colleague and I are creating.</p>

<p>LETTERS OF REC:
I will have strong letters of rec from both UCSC and UCD. I spent two days a week going to graduate student discussions regarding Alzheimer's at UCSC and was offered a lab position, so two professors there would be options for letters of rec. The doctor I work for at UCD will write me a letter of rec, and I transferred to UCD because of the lab position only, so I'm sure that would be a strong letter of rec.</p>

<p>I'm concerned, because my overall gpa is very low. It didn't click in my head that lower div classes mattered freshman and sophomore year. I am working to get all A's this year, but if I don't, my major gpa will be around a 3.149. I am committed to getting all A's though and made it possible to do so. Ultimate goal is PhD at a top school, but I think I need a master's first to bump my gpa up.</p>

Why do scientists referee papers (what's in it for them)?,"<p>I guess this has different answers in different fields of science, but I'm still interested in some good arguments as to why senior scientists would bother reviewing papers. I understand that it is prestigious and fantastic when Science or Nature approaches you with a request to referee—and since their desk rejection rate is high you can trust that it is solid research—but most don't even sign their reviews and I don't expect that they actually pay you for it so that only leaves two possible motives:</p>

<ol>
<li>Learning about what others in the field are working on</li>
<li>Feeling like they have to because that's just how scientific publishing works</li>
</ol>

<p>One of the reasons I ask is that if most referees are reviewing out of obedience rather than some other strong internal motivation, that would most likely reflect negatively on the quality of their reviews. They become bored, then lazy, then angry at things in the paper that don't reveal themselves to the reader immediately and in turn more likely to think positively of work that is simplistic and lacking of tedious (but important) calculations.</p>

How do I know that I have truly lost interest in research and should drop out of a top CS PhD program?,"<p>I am a second-year CS PhD pre-candidate in a top PhD program. During my first year, I published a first-author paper at the best conference in my area, which I know is a big accomplishment. My advisor is famous in his area and also very caring and supportive, and my labmates are great too.</p>

<p>The thing is my second project didn't go very well, which caused us to change the entire story right before the deadline. I worked more than 70 hours per week and gave all I could, but there was not enough time to get everything we need in a good shape, and my advisor was frustrated with the progress and pointed out problems that I hadn't seen everywhere. I continued to work, but found myself too frustrated and suddenly lost all interest in research, stopped caring about papers, did as best I could to avoid talking to anyone, and want to leave this place and never come back. I know most PhDs somehow have this feeling, but I notice that this time it's quite serious:</p>

<ul>
<li>Forcing myself to work resulted in a breakdown every night with the feeling that all I did was nonsense and meaningless.</li>
<li>My first paper has now become a joke, laughing at me that I could never publish with my own efforts.</li>
<li>I have no intention to participate in lab communication and truly don't want to talk to anyone. I can't even bear to hear others typing due to the feeling that I am the only one who doesn't make progress.</li>
</ul>

<p>How can I know if I truly have lost my interest in research (and should drop my Ph.D.), or if this is something that I can overcome? After all,  if this is the best I can do, why not go somewhere else and use my skills to actually contribute rather than wasting everybody's time? I am so tired of receiving new tasks at 4 am or 11 pm due the next day. I would highly appreciate your advice!</p>
",95747,10-09-2017 16:49,How should I deal with becoming discouraged as a graduate student?,"<p>I am a third year (starting fourth year in the fall) PhD student in mathematics. I've passed all qualifying exams and am currently doing research. As far as I can tell, I am not doing poorly. I have the good fortune of having a great advisor, being in a very supportive department, and having friends and family who genuinely care about my success. </p>

<p>The fact is research is hard. It appears to consist primarily of staring at a problem for days and days and days without getting anywhere. Sometimes, rarely, I do figure something out and that feels wonderful, but the overwhelming majority of my time appears to be spent banging my head against a mostly figurative wall. I am not complaining about the material being hard, and I am not averse to putting in hard work, but I get frequently discouraged when I realize the vast volumes of mathematics that I yet know nothing about (and probably never will). It's very hard to quantify progress - in particular, there are too few tangible returns after too many hours worked. I find myself thinking along the lines of ""Oh, if only someone actually smart were thinking about this problem they would have solved it in moments"" and so on. </p>

<p>I've talked about this to some number of people; here is some advice I have received:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take a day off. Putting in hours upon hours of trying things doesn't magically lead to a solution, particularly if the brain is tired and just wants to sleep.</li>
<li>Have a hobby. Since math research doesn't exactly provide instant gratification, a hobby might provide some instead. </li>
<li>Talk to other graduate students. Realize that many graduate students go through this.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm interested to know how other folks have dealt with being discouraged as a graduate student. Does it get better with time and experience? Is this a sign that research is not for me and that I should seriously consider a life outside academia?</p>

Corresponding author,"<p>I am an undergraduate student in the field of information technology. Recently I worked on an academic project under a supervisor. We want to publish it. My question is: Does the person who submits the manuscript to a journal become the corresponding author of that paper? That is, if my supervisor submits the manuscript, will he become the corresponding author by default? Can’t he refer the correspondence to me?</p>
",96080,16-09-2017 08:50,What is the explicit meaning of “corresponding author”?,"<h3>Problem</h3>

<p><em>This question was triggered by the comments on <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/q/84445/7734"">this discussion</a>, but comments and answers on <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/q/10062/7734"">these</a>
<a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/q/69588/7734"">questions</a>
confirm the existence of conflicting ideas.</em></p>

<p>There seem to be two prevalent interpretations of the word <em>corresponding author:</em></p>

<ol>
<li><p>The corresponding author is the one who corresponds the (unpublished) paper to the journal, i.e., who performs the technical process of submitting the paper, is available for requests on the review and publishing processes, and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>The corresponding author is the one who corresponds on the (published) paper with anybody who likes to do so, e.g., because they found an error or like some clarification.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>What I found out so far</h3>

<p>Until today, I was only aware of the first interpretation, which was confirmed by my experience: For all papers I submitted, I automatically became the corresponding author and cannot remember that I could choose one of my co-authors for this role. Some of these journals do not even indicate a corresponding author to the reader. Also, there already is a way to indicate that an author is available for questions on the paper (interpretation 2): stating the e-mail address.</p>

<p>On the other hand, other journals do indicate corresponding authorship, which makes little sense for interpretation 1. Also, the value put into this role by some funding agencies for its <a href=""//academia.stackexchange.com/q/10062/7734"">implied meaning</a> makes more sense for interpretation 2 (not that I completely agree with it).</p>

<p>Looking for some guidelines from publishers covering multiple fields, I found the following <a href=""//www.elsevier.com/journals/journal-of-computational-physics/0021-9991/guide-for-authors"" rel=""noreferrer"">instructions on denoting the corresponding author</a> from Elsevier¹, which kind-of covers both interpretations:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Clearly indicate who will handle correspondence at all stages of refereeing and publication, also post-publication.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While there are other questions on this site touching this issue, they focus on consequences of the interpretation, such as
<a href=""//academia.stackexchange.com/q/18167/7734"">how to assign corresponding authorship</a>,
<a href=""//academia.stackexchange.com/q/10062/7734"">the implications of corresponding authorship</a>, or
<a href=""//academia.stackexchange.com/q/69588/7734"">whom to address with a request</a>.</p>

<h3>Actual question</h3>

<p>What is the <strong>explicit</strong> meaning of the word <em>corresponding author?</em> Interpretation 1 or 2 as listed above, both, something else, or is this an extreme example of <a href=""//meta.academia.stackexchange.com/a/1212/7734"">academia’s inhomogeneity</a> and the answer depends on the field or publisher? Please answer only if you have more to offer than personal experience and individual journal guidelines. In particular, please address the possibility of a varying meaning.</p>

What is the difference between a conference paper and a workshop paper?,"<p>I recently participated in a conference. Several workshops were organized in parallel with the conference, and I also took part in one workshop to see what kind of material is presented there.</p>

<p>To me, there was no major difference between the conference paper presentations and the workshop paper presentations. Both usually discuss work that is in progress, i.e. could benefit from some new ideas. I didn't see a huge quality difference between workshop paper presentations and conference paper presentations. Both conference papers and workshop papers presented interesting ideas that usually had some merit.</p>

"Is there a downside to ""publishing"" a preprint first?","<p>Just as a background, I just finished my graduate school in August. I had three data chapters in my dissertation. My first data chapter was published long before graduation and was based on a different genetic dataset than my second and third.</p>

<p>My second and third data chapters were different analyses of the same SNP genotyping dataset (which I had generated). My second data chapter was just published, so I published the SNP dataset with it (as is generally expected). I need to convert my third data chapter into a manuscript, but due to other factors (e.g., looking for a postdoc, finding funding, etc.), it has sort of taken a back burner.</p>

<p>My dissertation doesn't become public until September 2018, so the general public (outside of witnessing conference presentations) doesn't have any access to my research from the third chapter. However, given that my dataset is public, I have some fears that I could get scooped. It's not too hard to replicate what I did.</p>

",96371,22-09-2017 19:14,Are there any examples for an ArXiv publication nurturing or preventing plagiarism?,"<p>First of all, this is about plagiarism in the sense of stealing ideas. Copy-and-paste plagiarism is included but not likely to happen in the cases relevant for this question.</p>

<p>Considering the publication of a paper prior to peer-reviewed publication on the ArXiv (or another preprint server), there are usually two main positions considering a possible theft of the idea (or somebody coming up with the same idea):</p>

<ul>
<li>If somebody manages to publish your idea in a peer-reviewed journal before you do, you can prove that you came up with the idea first or at least independently if you have published your paper on the ArXiv. Therefore it is a good idea to publish papers on the ArXiv before they have been published in a peer-reviewed journal.</li>
<li>If you publish your paper on ArXiv before it is published in a peer-reviewed journal, others may steal your work and publish it peer-reviewed before you do and thus take the scientific credit. It’s difficult to attack those people since the ArXiv is not peer-reviewed. Somebody could make a living of plagiarising ArXiv papers. Therefore it is a bad idea to publish papers on the ArXiv before they have been published in a peer-reviewed journal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Are there any <strong>example cases</strong> (or even studies) supporting either of these statements? Such examples would include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Has a peer-reviewed journal ever withdrawn a paper because it plagiarised an ArXiv paper?</li>
<li>Are there well-known cases of “unpunished” plagiarism of ArXiv papers? </li>
<li>Has anybody ever successfully resolved a priority dispute with a publication on ArXiv?</li>
<li>Has anybody ever accused somebody of plagiarising an ArXiv article (with the fact that the plagiarised article was published on ArXiv affecting the outcome).</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that it is really examples and not a theoretical analysis of the statements, I am looking for. (Neither of the two positions fully reflect my opinion and some of the soft premises¹ are debatable. However, debating about these viewpoints on a theoretical basis or attacking some of the premises is usually futile.)</p>

This individual isn't the best when it comes to navigating the perils of the Internet, which brings us to the scenario and question...</p>

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong>
For both fiscal and, I suppose, for personal reasons, they want to submit a paper to the <a href=""https://www.atiner.gr/cbc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ATINER</a> conference. I think that submitting a few papers may change their title and pay grade, which would help them before moving towards retirement within the next decade, as their family has some financial issues.</p>

",115322,15-08-2018 07:44,"What to do with a student coming to class in revealing clothing, to the degree that it disrupts the teaching environment?","<p>Since semester started, a female student has been attending classes scantily clad or wearing clothes that are too revealing, like a sport bra without shirt on top, booty shorts, semitransparent silk blouses without a bra, or even a bikini (this situation happened only once.) She does this once or twice every month and, apart from wearing revealing clothes, she behaves as any other student. My university is located in a fairly liberal country and I'm not a prude. There is no written dress code. During summer, crop tops and shorts are the norm.</p>

<p><a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/17739/should-professors-intervene-if-a-student-is-wearing-offensive-clothing-in-their?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1"">In a previous question</a>, someone brought about an issue regarding a student wearing an offensive shirt, but the answers to that question doesn't apply here. First, what the student is doing isn’t illegal like wearing a racist slogan and she isn’t underage; second, in the linked question, the TA was a female who feared becoming a victim of aggression. In my case, I am the male and I fear the if I tell the student I am not comfortable with her clothing, she might consider it harassment; third, she does this in plain view, not only in my class, and not during office hours <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/72672/female-students-coming-to-office-hours-in-overly-revealing-clothing"">(like here)</a> so I don't have reason to believe I've been somehow targeted be her.</p>

<p>This situation is disrupting the teaching environment - students start talking and leering instead of following the class. I have noticed that my students' level of attention and the class speed is significantly lowered when she comes wearing revealing clothes. It may cause issues outside the classroom, too. Recently, during my office hours, one student asked me my opinion on her, to which I replied that, as a TA, I had to remain non-judmental (and that he didn’t have authority to ask such questions.) Then the student told me rumor has it I haven’t intervened because I enjoy watching the student expose herself. You get here the subtlety of my situation: <strong>If I intervene, the student may consider I'm harassing her; if I don’t, I could become that perv who likes peering at his student.</strong></p>

<p>The department’s head says that I can let the bikini pass once, but that he will intervene if it happens again. He cannot do anything regarding silk blouses or sport bras, though. He will intervene only if the situation escalates, but I have authorization to intervene by myself to guarantee the class objectives are achieved. </p>

<p>Am I overreacting? If I let things go on as normal, will my students eventually assume I don’t care? <strong>If I'd have to talk to the student, how is the best way to address the situation considering gender issues?</strong></p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> It's true what StrongBad says, that the other students have their part in disrupting, but I'm certain that the student wearing revealing clothes also wants to elicit a reaction (whether it is disrupting the class, I don't know.) We are in winter now, so she comes fully clothed, changes her clothes once in the building and always sits where everybody sees her. Outside classes, she is fully clothed. Her behavior is 100% intentional and she knows that when wearing that kind of clothes the environment of the class will accordingly change.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I’m a bit surprised that none of the upvoted answers address any of my questions. Most of them are on the line of <strong>“do not be judgmental and tell the other students to behave”, which is what I have done:</strong> My approach has been not to brought additional attention on her. If someone is giggling, I would call his attention in general terms, but I would never expose the student in front of her peers with a sentence like “Stop looking at her clothing and pay attention to me”. That would be harassment. It’s also true that the student has the right to wear whatever she wants, and that other students should behave, but human concentration has its limits and I cannot blame anybody for that. <strong>If a disruption is too constant and obvious, students will eventually fall.</strong> Stephan Kolassa made an analogy that I'll borrow here: “Everybody is within their rights not to shower. But if someone stinks so badly that other students cannot concentrate, I would say the instructor should attempt to change that one person's behavior - not expect that the entire rest of the class adapts their utterly normal reaction.” Pete L. Clark has also a good point when saying “the instructor can actually talk with the student and get her to understand why what she's doing is almost certainly not in her own best interest”. That would save the student some headaches in the future and allow me to appropriately teach my class. Furthermore, my department's head is well informed about the issue and has given me authorization to talk with the student. So now the onus is on me. To avoid starting a bureaucratic storm, most classroom problems (I think almost every problem in an academic or business settings) are solved in a bottom-up fashion. First TA intervenes and if it doesn't work, you escalate to the next level.</p>

<p><strong>RESOLUTION: After many months, I'm writing again to tell what happened, but I can't give many details. After finals the student offered sex to another male TA. We had all made complains by then and got writing answers; we had our *ss covered. The student has been suspended. Moral of the story: get instructions in writing</strong>.   </p>

Publishing referee reports I have written - Yes or No and How?,"<p>I remember reading somewhere about someone who started publishing referee reports they had written online, along with sending them to the journal (or after). Unfortunately I do not remember where I saw this and can't seem to find it now.</p>

<p>However, my question does not concern the reviews I receive for the papers I submit, but concerns the reviews I write for papers I have been assigned. Since the whole process is done under confidentiality, it is not clear who owns the copyright on a review I wrote, and what does the review include. </p>

<p>For instance, let us assume that X is member of a PC of a conference Y, and assigns to me a review of a paper Z, written by A and B (assuming it's not a double-blind). Can I publish on my blog: ""Here is my review for Y, asked by X, on the paper Z, written by A and B""? </p>

<p>I think that there are two points here: </p>

<ol>
<li>Is it legal? (for instance, publishing the camera-ready version of a paper might be illegal due to the copyright transfer, would it be also the care here?). </li>
<li>Is it ethical? (who should I ask in order to do so? X? Y? A and B? everybody?). </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> There is been several comments/answer wondering <strong>why</strong> I would like to publish a review I wrote. To give a bit of background of this question, I believe that the current reviewing system, created when the academic community was small and there was no Internet (i.e. no easy access to information), might not be the best, although clearly working. This is for me a very interesting debate, but somehow out of the scope the Q&amp;A format of Academia SE, which is why I tried to focus on my question on whether it was possible to do so, not if it was the best thing to do in the current system (and just to be clear, I don't plan to do it, but I just like to know what are my options). Anyway, thanks for the answers bringing a different light on this debate. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> After seeing the update in Jeff's answer, I just realised that I didn't make it explicit that I was talking about reviews <em>after</em> the reviewing process. Jeff says that it's ok if the paper is accepted, and although I clearly understand the argument of <em>why</em> I shouldn't publish a review of a rejected paper, the question still holds: by publishing a review of a rejected paper, I publish the information that these authors submitted this paper to this conf/journal, which is supposed to be confidential between the authors and the editors. Would I break any rule by doing so?   </p>

Can I publish a paper in a good journal without having an academic position?,"<p>This community is introduced by a friend of mine about a week ago and I hope I can write my questions clearly (English is not my first language and I normally have poor communication skills...) </p>

<p>My story: I started my BSc in mathematics about 22 years ago (when I was age 9) and I decided (had to) quit after one painful semester that I still remember it. I studied on my own and a few years later I decided to solve the notorious impenetrable problem the Hodge conjecture. I have not achieved that goal yet but (I think) I have more than enough that people get a fields medal for that. And with my past experiences I believe that I am most probably not wrong in the technicalities (peer review need to be done though)... Nonetheless I can't continue working hard on the problem as I used to because of spending a lot more time on making money (from teaching to laboring jobs) so better to publish whatever I have to possibly get a research job than living a fading life and every-day-increasing severe-depression. But there are many obstacles I believe: </p>

<p>1- Can I publish an article without having an academic position and even without a university degree, at all? </p>

<p>2- I <em>never</em> care about fame and I absolutely don't care if solving some unsolved problem is attached to a particular name (=person) but handing over 18 years of my research to someone who have authority to easily publish it has a high risk of his/her plagiarism temptation thus ruining a possible would-be good life of mine. How can I trust someone?</p>

<p>3- Evaluation of my results is a necessity before I have any claim of that but if it turns out to be valuable enough can I get an academic position without having a physical degree and not going through all many years of official undergraduate and graduate programs in mathematics?   </p>

<p>By the way, I hold an Iranian passport which means that I cannot travel Europe/US/Canada/... to present my research with just an invitation for a conference. (Visa-on-arrival is available for Iranian citizens in Mozambique or Samoa airports but I don't think that be helpful; no offense).  </p>

Is it fair to punish the student for not knowing what's in the course?,"<p>A number of questions (e. g., <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/q/80898/78612"">this one</a> or <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/q/116019/78612"">that one</a>) discuss the situations where the student is punished after invoking, in the exam context, knowledge that's outside the scope of the course. This leads to a more general question: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose the student knows and understands perfectly all the material taught in the course, and perhaps some more. Is it fair to lower their grade for not knowing <em>which</em> material has been taught and <em>how</em> it was presented?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the answers to the above questions, it seems that many feel that there's no problem with lowering the grade. I can think of two arguments in favour of that view:</p>

<ul>
<li>in order to test knowledge, the exam questions have to include implicit context, notation, etc., that require familiarity with a particular course. More details on this type of reasoning can be found in <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/a/80961/78612"">this answer</a>.</li>
<li>anyway, the grades are often not determined solely by what students know in the end; e. g., attending lectures, participating in the class discussions, etc., may be part of the grade. And if you have done so, surely you know what's been in the course.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let me explain why the above arguments do not satisfy me. The first one concedes that it may be unfair, and then essentially admits a failure on the part of the professor to design a fair exam. But then, shouldn't one rather strive to make the questions as self-contained and unambiguous as possible? For the second one, we may ask, again, <em>why</em> it is fair to take anything but the end knowledge into account for the grade, and the answer will likely be that some version of ""we use attendance etc. as a proxy for final knowledge"" which, once again, brushes off the question as to how fair is this.</p>

  <p>Is there a coherent argument that justifies that it is <em>fair</em> to lower the grade in the above circumstances? </p>

<p>I know too little about U.S. immigration laws, and the text of the mentioned act looks complete gibberish to me. Could anyone say what the standard answer to this question would be and why?</p>

<p>Remark: this question is <em>formally</em> different from the one stated in a <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/79290/answer-to-will-you-be-able-to-provide-proof-of-your-identity-and-employment-eli"">question on general eligibility</a> (first, here the context is a particular legislation act with its own terminology, second, there the question contains ""presently"", and, third, there no answer refers to IRCA explicitly). In law matters, this difference may be important.</p>

Is it usual to ask for several references for postdoc positions?,"<p>I have seen postdoc job adverts which were asking for as many as three recommendation letters, despite being supervised positions and inviting freshly graduated PhD students.  Is this practice common and reasonable?</p>

<p>As a more practical question, how should an applicant deal with this situation?</p>

<p>It seems to me that it is not unusual that the only person a student worked with extensively is their advisor. In fact it would even seem like a good thing to have an advisor who does not lead a large group and has time to work closely with all their students. Yet such students would find it rather difficult to obtain three recommendation letters.</p>
",96733,01-10-2017 10:37,Who to cite as referees for a post doc position?,"<p>I am currently finishing my PhD thesis (in Mathematics) and trying to find a post doc position. </p>

<p>My PhD supervisor is a very nice person and is, of course, one of my referees.
However, most places need 2-3, so I am not sure who else to ask.</p>

<p>I have a secondary supervisor but we only talked once really during a formal thing. So asking a referee who does not know much about the work or the personality is a bit... weird...</p>

<p>I had a decent relationship with my Master's supervisor, but unfortunately we have not corresponded once in the 3+ years after my masters, so me writing  ""hey, do you remember me from waaaay back then, would you please write a reference for me"" seems a bit ... strange .. too.</p>

<p>I have published several papers already but I don't have any co-authors whom I could ask. </p>

<p>I have given one talk outside my university but I am not sure who to ask there. I don't actually know these people, my supervisor referred me to them and they were OK so I gave the talk.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

Can instructors fail honest students when tests are too hard because most students are cheating?,"<p>I am in Nursing school.  I can <strong>prove</strong> that 80-90% of students have cheated <em>every</em> semester.  They pass test banks around in email, text or Instant Messenger.  Every semester I've come forward (5 instructors) but nothing major has happened.  In 3 semesters of nursing school the faculty has never condemned nor said a word about using test banks.  This semester I tried to warn instructors before the first exam, but they didn't listen.  Now a few of us simply can't pass the exam because we're not cheating.  The exams are that hard.  </p>

<p>Test banks from previous semesters were being passed down from the semester ahead of us.  I looked back at these test banks after the exam and found 21 questions just in one chapter.  That's when I emailed them the test banks that were being passed around.  It's a fine example of how academic dishonesty cheats everyone including the ones being honest.</p>

<p>Every semester Instructor makes the exams harder and harder because ""statistically"" the instructor data shows statistically ""These are good/not too hard questions"".  But I have the documentation to show WHY people are able to pass.  Had I used these test banks I would be passing.  Honesty is earning a few of us a 60.00% on each exam.</p>

<p>What can I do?  I warned them; they didn't listen. I plan on filing a complaint and a grade grievance.  My question is: can an instructor fail students who are being honest?  When there is clear proof of compromised exams and academic dishonesty throughout the class. Is it our fault they can't catch it?  Is it our fault they have no idea what a hard question really is? Can instructors really fail people for being honest and choosing not participate?  </p>
",96746,01-10-2017 18:13,"Is it ethical to use past years' final exams that the professor hasn't explicitly given, to study for a final in the same class?","<p>This happened to me in my 2nd year of grad school, in a STEM field. As many do, our professor gave the class the last year's final, to give us an idea of what areas to study and what to expect, etc, which he obviously isn't required to do and is very nice of him.</p>

<p>Now, the reason he gives us last year's one is because, at the end of the year, he returns your test, so he knows that most of the ones floating around are the ones from last year.</p>

<p>However, as many older professors (in my experience, but maybe younger ones too) do, he also reuses exams from previous years (not even concepts or the same problems with different parameters, just literal copies), since the material and curriculum of this course is very well established/so old that nothing needs to change. I don't blame him for this; if you teach the same course on and off over 20 years, coming up with good exam questions over and over again would be annoying.</p>

<p>Now, what my question regards is, I realized a student in my class had past tests from not just the last time the class was taught, but literally the past 5 years. I don't know how to say this part as diplomatically as possible, but this student came from a country that about nearly half our program comes from. The other half (aside a few outliers) is from the U.S. I don't mention this to demonize or stereotype anyone; I believe it's relevant because the students from this country (in my program) are almost uniformly very tight knit, and seem to often share resources between each other and across years more than is normal amongst everyone else. The relevance is that one group has resources that others don't.</p>

<p>So my question is, is this ethical (for the student to do, I mean) ?</p>

<p>Just to put some relevant ideas/arguments/details down:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assume (and I believe it was the case) that in the scenario I've written, the rest of the students (the ones who <em>don't</em> have the past tests) don't know about the students that have the past tests, so they can't do something simple like ask them.</li>
<li>I think many will argue that if the professor didn't want this happening, he wouldn't reuse tests, or at least as exactly as he does. However, I don't think this changes the ethics of the situation: the point is, in this situation, you <em>can</em> get away with it, but is it right?</li>
<li>I imagine the professor would not approve of this (actually, recently, another professor said in regards to his final ""I know there are past ones floating around, please don't look at them"", so at least he disapproved), but an argument could also be made for the possibility of him approving: It's not as though having the previous tests just makes it a given that you'll ace it, it's still a lot of work to figure out all the problems such that you can reliably do them later (he doesn't give back the <em>answers</em> to the tests, only the tests themselves). I could imagine a professor being okay with students getting a better grade on the final if it meant they learned more and worked to get it.</li>
<li>This professor never actually said not to, so the student wasn't explicitly disobeying anyone.</li>
<li>This question really has two subquestions, but they're very similar: a) Would it be ethical if <em>everyone</em> had these pasts tests (that the professor did not know about/give)? And b), Is it ethical if only a subset of the class has these tests. Obviously if you say no to (a) you say no to (b), but you might feel as though the concept of using past tests isn't wrong, but some students having an unfair advantage is.</li>
</ul>

How to prevent work from exacerbating situational depression?,"<p>I am experiencing situational depression. This isn't 'discouragement' due to research. Me feeling inadequate in my research is NOT the problem. The problem is that the steps involved in research seem to be at best, not helping, or worse - exacerbating the negative emotions that are associated with depression.</p>

<p>Let me rephrase that - I have not felt 'impostor syndrome', and I do not feel it now (sorry if it sounds a tad bigheaded but I want to avoid confusion).</p>

<p>I have some idea of the things I need to do to combat depression, but it seems to me that they all involve staying away from work at the lab. Has anyone faced this? Can I do anything to prevent loss of productivity?</p>

<p>Usually, I hear the following ways to fight depression:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get in a routine.</li>
<li>Set goals.</li>
<li>Do something new (don't get stuck in a rut)</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, these can be applied when I am free. But the majority of my waking hours are in the lab (or supposed to be). While doing bio research:</p>

<ol>
<li>The routine/ schedule is thrown off whack by unforeseen developments/ etc. </li>
<li>Goals, even minor ones, may or may not be reached. This is research.</li>
<li>Can't help getting stuck in a rut if we're trying to get data out of a particular experiment. </li>
</ol>

<p>I took a week off, and it helped, but doesn't seem to have helped enough. Any suggestions?</p>
",96840,03-10-2017 17:31,How should I deal with becoming discouraged as a graduate student?,"<p>I am a third year (starting fourth year in the fall) PhD student in mathematics. I've passed all qualifying exams and am currently doing research. As far as I can tell, I am not doing poorly. I have the good fortune of having a great advisor, being in a very supportive department, and having friends and family who genuinely care about my success. </p>

<p>The fact is research is hard. It appears to consist primarily of staring at a problem for days and days and days without getting anywhere. Sometimes, rarely, I do figure something out and that feels wonderful, but the overwhelming majority of my time appears to be spent banging my head against a mostly figurative wall. I am not complaining about the material being hard, and I am not averse to putting in hard work, but I get frequently discouraged when I realize the vast volumes of mathematics that I yet know nothing about (and probably never will). It's very hard to quantify progress - in particular, there are too few tangible returns after too many hours worked. I find myself thinking along the lines of ""Oh, if only someone actually smart were thinking about this problem they would have solved it in moments"" and so on. </p>

<p>I've talked about this to some number of people; here is some advice I have received:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take a day off. Putting in hours upon hours of trying things doesn't magically lead to a solution, particularly if the brain is tired and just wants to sleep.</li>
<li>Have a hobby. Since math research doesn't exactly provide instant gratification, a hobby might provide some instead. </li>
<li>Talk to other graduate students. Realize that many graduate students go through this.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm interested to know how other folks have dealt with being discouraged as a graduate student. Does it get better with time and experience? Is this a sign that research is not for me and that I should seriously consider a life outside academia?</p>

How secure is it to receive an offer of post-doc position in email?,"<p>I received an unofficial offer for a post-doctoral researcher position a few days ago from a well-known and respected professor in the field, and the institution is very well-ranked. At the same time, I already have an official offer from a different place, but not comparable in value. So, I need to know how certain the unofficial offer is to justify declining the official one. </p>

<p>Actually, after I received the first offer officially, I contacted the other places to which I had applied, and asked them to decide on my application, and set a deadline for them by when I had to decide about my already-issued offer. I received the second offer right before the deadline as an email in clear and strong words ('I am pleased to offer you ...') <strong>similar to what you see in an official offer letter</strong>. I quickly accepted the offer. </p>

<p>I think that since he knew I would have to decide about the other offer, he tried to be clear in the email, encouraging me to decline the other one. However, I'm not sure whether it would be wise to do so. More specifically, does such an email work as a legally binding document (e.g., capable to be held up at a court)? I'd say the difference between the values of the positions actually justifies 1%  risk. What do you suggest?</p>
",96854,04-10-2017 00:47,How secure is a post doc job offer in an email from the department chair prior to receiving the official written letter?,"<p>I'm in/from the US. I'm finishing my PhD this semester. I've been offered a research postdoc, via email, by the dept. chair at one of my top choices, but outside the US (would rather not give too many details). I replied to say I'm accepting the position. Everyone seems very happy: me, the chair, the professor I intend to work with. But I have nothing in writing.</p>

<p>In the meantime I have an offer for a teaching job at another place much closer, which I would definitely take if I were not getting the above postdoc. I don't feel comfortable turning this down until the other setup is official.</p>

<p>I emailed the postdoc place asking for an official letter. They said they would send it out by mail, but ignored my request for a scanned emailed copy, and I need to give a yes or no answer to the second place before their alleged letter would arrive. I emailed them again about the scanned copy and no response though it has only been a couple days.</p>

<p>How confident should I be that this postdoc is really happening? How common is it for informal agreements like that to be backed out of? Are scanned emailed letters less customary outside the US? It would be terrible of I turned down the teaching job and then the postdoc fell through.</p>

<p>Also, what should I say to the other place if I am still unsure about the postdoc by the deadline for my yes/no?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I got the requested scan of the official letter today. I ran it by my adviser and he says this seals the deal and I can cancel any other interviews. Whew!!!</p>
