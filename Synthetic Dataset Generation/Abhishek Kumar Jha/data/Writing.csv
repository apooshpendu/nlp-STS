How to present details about the setting in a fantasy world without telling?,"<p>One of the rules of good writing is the <a href=""https://writers.stackexchange.com/questions/761/the-rules-of-writing"">show, don't tell</a> rule.</p>

<p>I want to create a realistic fantasy world, so I've thought about details like astronomy, geography and so on. For instance, this world has a <strong>lighter gravity than Earth</strong>, which allows flying heavy animals and living on higher mountain tops.</p>

<p>But how could I show this for the readers <strong>without telling them</strong>? And without referring to Earth?</p>
",26144,18-01-2017 16:35,How to show that something is different than in real life?,"<p>I'm writing fiction set in the near future (~15-20 years). The world is still mostly the same and thus familiar to the reader, but an important part of the story is that a few things are radically different in subtle ways.</p>

<p>I wonder what some ways are to show those subtle differences without being too blunt?</p>

<p>Example: Let's say that in the future, TVs track how many people are watching and refuse to show certain content if too many people are watching.</p>

<p>My character could say <code>Man, remember in the old days when you could cram an entire classroom into your living room and just watch a movie? That new system sucks!</code>, but that is rather blunt.</p>

<p>One option is to have the characters run into the restriction head on: <code>Henry arrived late to the party. To the great anger of the group, the TV detected him as an additional viewer and refused to show any more until the extra group fee was paid</code>. </p>

<p>But it may not always be feasible to have the characters run into that restriction, sometimes I just want to show it's there without the characters really paying attention to it since to <em>them</em> it's perfectly normal.</p>

<p>While the exact solution greatly depends on the story, I wonder if there are established techniques for that?</p>

What if the hero doesn't win?,"<p>I'm just an amateur writer.  One thing that's strange to me is that there seem to be ""rules"" about writing.  The story should consist of five parts, etc.  To my untrained writing brain this seems to stifle creativity, and enforce a science-like structure in what I thought was an art.</p>

<p>I'm thinking of breaking one of the rules.   At the end of my story, my hero just isn't strong enough to kill the villain.  He gets away unscathed, but others are in peril due to his weakness.</p>

<p>Should I absolutely not do this?  Must I adhere to the formula?  What are the consequences, if I don't?</p>
",27540,14-04-2017 15:01,Creating a story in which the hero(es) lose,"<p>So I am still in the primitive stages of creating my own world and story, if I even do it that is.  I am still trying to get a feel for where I want to go with it.  The biggest issue would be that, my world would be heavily influenced from novels like Lord of The Rings, Redwall (children's series similar to Lord of the Rings with personification of animals), Shannara series, and so on.  These are stories I grew up with and loved.  This would also mean that, my story would be very cookie cutter fantasy.  You can apply various elements from across literature works, but they will have a familiar feel due to the fact that the story wouldn't be ""original"" as the influence would be pretty evident.  </p>

<p>1) Would having a cookie cutter story be okay?  We see this recipe often repeated in anime where the story has a similar feel and an expected outcome with similar character personalities.  It seems to work in anime as many of these shows are popular.</p>

<p>2) Because stories and books for that matter seem to be on the decline as more and more visual media becomes available, would I need surprise elements or twists that are otherwise unexpected from the said genre in hopes that the story would be read and not passed over as ""another one of these""?</p>

<p>3) Would creating a story that ends with the enemy winning be something interesting to others?  Let's face it, if a more realistic version of LOTR was created, chances are, middle earth would be ruled by Sauron right now.  I for one, would love to read a follow up novel about a world ruled by orcs.  Would a story that ended with the ""bad side"" winning be a desirable fresh outcome that people would read?  The anime Attack on Titan is heavily popular.  This story is depressing, hopeless, many main characters die, and humanity is losing the fight.</p>

<p>I hope these questions are not too opinion based as I am more interested to see if such a world would be desirable by an audience.  What literature works would fall into a dark fantasy?  Game of Thrones would be the closest body of work, however it still isn't quite the tone I am looking for.  Would this be too niche?</p>

<p>I wonder if I would alienate the fantasy reader because it would be a different expected outcome.  Take Star Wars for example.  I personally was kind of put off with Rogue One for deviating too far from the Star Wars theme and plot.  Many people do not feel this way, but I personally did.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> ""If you yourself aren't going to buy into the world you're creating, you can cast-iron guarantee no-one else will.""  Let me clarify something that I have been seeing popping up in responses.  It isn't that I am not passionate enough about my idea or that I am not 100% sold on the idea, it's that I am writing for others and not myself.  You can be 100% passionate about the earth being flat and you believe it to your core, but that doesn't mean I am going to listen to you just because you are passionate.</p>

<p>I just wanted to say WOW.  The feedback and offering of help and good research materials (books to read) has been more than I ever hoped to have received.  I really appreciate everyone's positive critique that gave me a TON of thoughts to ponder over.  It probably is pretty evident that this is my first attempt at writing a non academic piece of work so that is also why I am a bit nervous/hesitant.  So thank you to everyone who offered advice and will provide any future insight after this edit.  It is greatly appreciated and it gives me more confidence that I should further pursue this.</p>

Is it worth switching to Dvorak if I already type fast?,"<p>I am currently learning Dvorak, and I wonder if it's worth it to switch. This question has been asked before, but the criteria were different. In those questions people said they went from 50 to 60 WPM, but when using Qwerty I already reach ~95 WPM, and not with touch typing either (I have never had any typing courses), I use the hybrid method <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">See Wikipedia</a>. And after long typing ""sessions"" my wrists never hurt.</p>

<p>People who have switched to Dvorak, have you lost any typing speed or have you even topped your (possibly) already very fast speed? Because I want to switch to Dvorak so I won't develop RSI later in life (plan to do a lot more typing) but if that could mean I'd type a lot slower, I'm not sure if it'd be worth it when there are ways to treat RSI, </p>

How to expose a reader to the rules of a fantastical world?,"<p>I am currently in the process of re-writing my play Black Tape as a novel. Because of the change in format, more needs to simply happen - which I am entirely okay with. Main feature of the universe in which it is set is that death (and by extension afterlife, destiny and the flow of time itself) is run as a heavily bureaucratic LLC.</p>

",28581,08-06-2017 12:54,How should I introduce new and complex technologies or tools?,"<p>I'm writing a Science Fiction book. While this book doesn't push reality very far, there are some new technologies and tools that I have added. One tool is used more frequently than all the others, and it has a very complex system (although there are other systems just as complex used somewhat less frequently in the story). For the sake of this question, we'll call it MYTO. The protagonist and the other supporting characters use MYTO on a regular basis, and an adequate understanding of it is critical to understanding and enjoying the story due to the frequent use of it. Normally, it wouldn't be a problem for me to introduce it and describe its functions. However, due to the complexity of MYTO and the systems surrounding it, I've found myself in a bit of a predicament.</p>

<p>I've written several drafts and concepts trying to describe MYTO and the systems it uses, and I've ruled out an all-at-once approach - it would take too long, and the reader would get lost and bored. Because MYTO is used in settings with high action, it is very difficult to describe it as I go along.</p>

<p>For a bit of a background, MYTO was a pre-existing technology based on other communication technologies used by the military and special forces in my story. My main character took it and modified it to create an improved version with several more functions and more polished functionality. I've tried to write this out, but it also gets very technical and boring, so I'm put back to square one.</p>

<p><strong>How should I go about introducing the technology and its functions?</strong> Some of the functions can and have been explained throughout the story as needed, but they are lesser functions.</p>

This means that I do quite a bit of planning for the world that the story will be set in. I know that's not a bad thing, but I have noticed that I have a tendency to get bogged down in specific events - especially historical events. I'll find myself describing entire battles or diplomatic missions or even important local events as though they were the story itself - and almost none of that is <em>ever</em> going to even show up in the story!</p>

<p>I really enjoy that preparation, but eventually my notes become so unwieldy, it's hard to actually sit down and write the story while keeping it all straight. Not to mention that it's kind of wasting time when I could be writing.</p>

Does anyone have any advice on how know when it might be necessary to do some more fleshed-out preparation and when it's just wasting time (and accumulating too many notes)?</p>

<p>By the way, my average preparation results in something on the order of 150,000+ words (the most I've ever written is 300,000).

<p>Is it safe to include the names of these weapons (like Zenit or Molot) to correspond to the guns, or do I have to come up with another, original name and reference it to have a similar function to the actual in-game weapon?  As of now, I'm assuming I can use the name because I'm clearly stating in my novel that the designers in the story gave it the name because they were lazy and decided to use the name featured in the actual game that uses it.  In that case, I will tell where the original name came from.</p>

<p>When I first tried writing fantasy - a long long time ago - I wrote a book that was meant to be really serious and intense. However, I wrote it in a way where the characters joked around, and had more fun than they should have been having in a really dire situation. The whole thing turned into more of a comedic piece rather than being serious fantasy, and lost the atmosphere.</p>
<p>My new <strike>masterpiece</strike> trilogy is an epic. I've kept it super serious and to the point, and it's gone <strong>really really really really</strong> well. I'm infinitely happy. However, upon beginning book two, which I started 4 days ago, I have started slipping back into old habits. The characters keep making jokes, and generally enjoying themselves even despite the fact that their home has just been destroyed. I've gone through and edited some of the the humour out and have kept a bit more of the atmosphere of loss and mourning, but I came up with this question while doing it.</p>
<h2>Question</h2>
<p>Let's get right to it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How much humour can you have before you lose the serious, intense atmosphere?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it right to include humour when something absolutely <strong>grievous</strong> is going on in the character's lives?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because motivation is unshowable. It must be told. (In fact, most things must be told.)

",32326,03-01-2018 19:57,Using fake swear words without them seeming out of place to the reader,"<p>This is not a question about slang, but about swearing and word creation.</p>

<p>I have a character who uses swear words, and this is part of his voice. I do not use real swear words. I want the <em>sense</em> of those words in the story. But not the words.</p>

<p>Other characters, in other parts of my world, simply use descriptive phrases effectively, no swear words. The two approaches to 'swearing' tells us where characters grew up, etc.</p>

<p>I've seen authors make up swear words that look like, and have an etymology similar to, real swear words - but are not actually swear words. (Like 'frak' on BSG.) </p>

<p><strong>Here's what I have done instead, to incorporate swearing into the story:</strong> In my story, two different words for the concept of God/heavenly father/lord, are fake words derived from author-of-life, and from beautiful idol. </p>

<p>When I read these fake words, they make sense, and I think a reader who realizes the fake word is related to, for example, 'beautiful idol,' will 'get it.'</p>

<p>The problem is, when critique groups read my passages, they routinely get hung up on the fake words. They also don't understand why I am 'translating' the dialogue, but not the swear words, into regular English. </p>

<p>I don't understand this. Before I prune these words out altogether (because I'd prefer to keep them as character voice and religious tradition), I'd like to find out if there are guidelines. </p>

<p><strong>My Question:</strong> What is the best way to introduce fake swear words so that they are assimilated easily by the reader? Is there a rule of thumb as to how many such words could be introduced per chapter? </p>

<p>I'm considering solutions like: the first two occurrences of the 'author' word to be firmly planted within a phrase we'd recognize. ""By author above, you will not hurt my child!"" or, ""I swear by author-of-life that I did not raid that cookie jar!"" And then, after a couple of instances where the swear word is inside a phrase we'd recognize, I can use the word for 'God' all on its own. (The short and long versions roughly equate to God and God-in-Heaven).</p>

<p>Is this the solution? I am not seeing current authors make up fake words like this, but I would like to. Another solution is to have a character explain to another character - 'Oh, that word loosely translates to 'God.' ' </p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> - Happy to report that people reading recent drafts have no issue with the swear words. I'm down to three. The word for 'shit' is introduced after saying that something smells like sewage. The word for God is used within contextual sentences, like the example of 'Crom' given in comments. The word for 'hell' is close enough to words we would recognize that it parses. I took out the other swear words, though I think I still have a 'god-damn' in there, a single instance, with plans to use it in book 2. </p>

I've got this idea for a book that explores a sort of philosophical theory. Similar to some of Ayn Rand's work (not her philosophies, but just the type of book itself).

I don't want to tell the reader outright what I want them to think. No ""Thus we see…"" I don't want them to feel like this is preaching. 
How do you create it so that it poses questions to the reader and makes them think and begin to see the argument? 
Say for example I want to write a book about how smoking is bad. I write a story where a kid's mom gets lung cancer and dies and he gets second hand smoking and gets emphysema. The message is pretty clear and people might hate because it's preachy. 
I don't want to do that.</p>

How to construct a beat to make an effective treatment for the purposes of revision & group revisions of a Novel?,"<h3>Why this Question is Being asked</h3>

<p>In a previous question it was suggested that I write a <strong>treatment</strong> to assist with revising &amp; cutting. A <strong>treatment</strong> is essentially a multi-page, spoilerific summary of exactly what happens in a written work; but, the term comes not from the Novel, but from screenplay writing and is made up of <strong>beats</strong>. A <strong>beat</strong> is not standardly defined across the writing community and it is used in multiple ways.  </p>

<h3>Known Deficient Definitions/Examples/Uses of Beats/Treatments</h3>

<p>At the time that question was asked, I had seen a couple examples of <strong>treatments</strong> or <strong>beat-sheets</strong> and I found the documents compelling and likely useful for revision process, but did not know how to convert an active work into one, which meant finding the beats and collecting them all in one place. That's because most of the places you read on the internet are going to contain partial or limited versions of one or two of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>an example of a beat sheet</li>
<li>an example of a treatment</li>
<li>a loose definition of a beat as the smallest unit of any action (essentially every action in the movie)</li>
<li>a loose definition of a beat as the smallest unit of plot (once every five  minutes in a movie; a turning point for characters; or every swing of momentum within a scene, this could literally be nearly every second of staging)</li>
<li>a very detailed definition of a beat: all of the character considerations backing any action in a scene of the film which is great for directing a movie or play, but not good as a summary for revision purposes if you're going for a smaller document.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is further complicated because a script is a very different thing than a novel. A script is usually shorter (only providing dialogue and very minimal setting/action descriptions) and, due to the medium, is often simpler, in terms of complexity, than a book.</p>

<p>So the question is, which of these definitions is most useful when writing a <strong>treatment</strong> for revision of a <strong>novel</strong>? And once I've picked the definition I want to target, what is the right way to construct said <strong>beats</strong>? Which moments in the book should qualify for <strong>beat status</strong> and which should be discarded as superfluous? And the next level, even if it qualifies as a beat for the treatment, how do you know you need to cut it from the work anyways? The definition of a beat within the context of a revision treatment should make it obvious why you'd want to use beats &amp; treatments for revision; and based on previous discussions I'd expect (but here's an opportunity to correct me) that the act of summarizing the important and/or extraneous moments in a novel lets you focus the book on what it is about and cut the superfluous chunks of text; but you can only get there if you can differentiate ""superfulous-but-recordable"" beats from ""additional-details/happenings-that-aren't-beats.""</p>

<h3>And why this is different from other questions.</h3>

<p>A good answer to this question will provide actionable steps to create useful beats and a useful treatment for the revision process; it will define the components to assist in the actionable desired end result result; and it will be clear how the construction and use of this document will lead to a <strong>better novel</strong>. An unhelpful answer would simply list examples or one of the myriad definitions without talking about why this is important and how its helpful in the revision process.</p>

<hr>

<p>The dragon, Saphire No-last-name-given (according to the <em>Most Generic Fantasy Names for all Fantasy Races 3.14th edition</em>) is supposed to be on the good side, but her character traits...</p>

<p>She never really excelled at combat, relying on traps, tactics, and manipulated people as ablative meatshields.  Once she runs out tricks and safeguards, Saphire goes into an unstoppable <em>crying/sobbing/pleading for life</em> trio, and though she doesn't antagonize humans directly, being busy with amassing knowledge, is very condescending when speaking to/about them, almost always boasting about her (actually existing) intellectual superiority, which is surprisingly absent when talking to someone who could easily kill her (a strangely long list, by the way).</p>

<p>To make things even worse, her goal is to once use the before mentioned knowledge (military tactics, agriculture, economic theories) to rule over, pretty much the entire planet, because she thinks that everyone else is too stupid to do and succeed in it.</p>

  <p>With nothing to do, Haku took the chore of exterior design, and lifted the sloping roof, repainted, and replaced the decks boards with wood that he cut out of the forest near the house. This happened fairly quickly and only took him a few hours to complete. Haku wiped his forehead on his arm, removing the majority of the sweat that culminated there. His ears picked up a distant noise and he swerved on his heels, making a full 180 turn.</p>
  
  <p>Motorized humming emanated from the East and several hover scooters rode up to the house. The guy in the front dismounted his scooter and lifted his visor up, his face was completely alien. Haku got a closer look at him as he confidently strode up to where Haku was. His features were all off, they were pointed and sharp, and his eyes were too...discolored. They were a bright turquoise that were filled with life. Haku was skeptical and pressed a button on his watch, notifying KoKo that something was wrong. </p>
  
  <p>“Cute house,” the man said, almost sarcastically. His voice was soft and angelic. It filled Haku with dread, though, because he knew that wasn’t an ordinary human quality. </p>
  
  <p>“What are you?” Haku asked, not caring that it was inconsiderate to ask someone that question.</p>
  
  <p>“I’m really glad you asked that, human.” The man started, he took his helmet completely off now. He had ears that were pointed at the top, not in a ‘birth defect’ sort of way. “I am what you would call an Elf, young one. I am Prince Vincent.” He bowed towards the very confused Haku.</p>

  <p>“You pose a threat to the Prince, you must be detained, for His Majesty's safety,” one of the guards shot back, taking the weapons and holding her arms back. Vince was pleased with himself and smiled a venomous smile.

  <p>“Pleasure,” Vince said, holding his hand out to shake. Haku gripped it and shook one firm shake. The smile was still plastered on his face when he carefully pulled his gloves off, one digit at a time. “So there is no NOVA, and no contract… Who, may I ask, is running the world?”</p>
  
  <p>Haku lifted an eyebrow and pursed his lips. “Our planet doesn’t run like yours does, your Majesty,” Haku emphasized the title, indicating that it isn’t customary to have royalty on Earth. “We have individual sections of the planet, run by different people in differing degrees of power.” Haku hesitated before continuing. “This country is without a leader…”</p>
  
  <p>Vince’s ears twitched and his mind raced with a plan. Since this large portion of land is leaderless, he could rule it. This made his initial plan so much simpler. </p>
  
  <p>With faux sympathy Vince said, “I see, I couldn’t imagine the horrors of having such a lack of order in my country.” He paused to glimpse at the small house in front of him. “My people and I would love to help you restore balance here.” </p>
  
  <p>Haku knew what he was proposing by that devious smile splayed on his face, but this could be a huge opportunity. “I’ll be right back, Sir. I have to grab someone real quick.” He went around to the back of the house without waiting for an answer, a pang of guilt hit his heart as he left KoKo out there with them alone. </p>
  
  <p>He reached the secret door to the cages, where he last saw his dad. He spotted him sitting on an operating table with a book in his hands. “Dad, Elves.” Haku said in between breaths. Greyson understood exactly what he was saying and closed his book immediately. “Guards…. They have KoKo, dad!”</p>
  
  <p>Greyson bolted up the steps to the trap door and smashed them open, Haku close behind. When they reached the front, the prince stopped what he was doing and his ears dropped. </p>
  
  <p>“Son, of, man…. Sir Greyson?” Vince gasped. Haku was genuinely confused at this point, if he wasn’t before, he definitely was now.</p>
  
  <p>Greyson looked unamused when he saw the prince and placed a hand on his hip. “What the hell are you doing here, Vincent?” He asked this as if he were an old friend. </p>
  
  <p>“I was here to re-activate our contract with NOVA, but it seems here that they’re all dead now,” Vince stated simply. Greyson snapped his fingers and the guards holding KoKo let her go and shoved her over to Haku. </p>
  
  <p>“You two, go inside, now please,” he instructed. Haku and KoKo obeyed immediately. </p>
  
  <p>“Well, now that you know they’re dead, what are you still doing here?” Greyson was impatient with Vince, he didn’t want to be alone with him if at all necessary. </p>
  
  <p>Vince chuckled beautifully and moved his loose bangs out of his right eye, “My planet is dying, Greyson. You know exactly why, too.”
  Indeed he did know, there was only a matter of time before the elves mined right through their planet’s core and they will implode on themselves. </p>

<p>This is the first  written plot twist, it expands on my idea of the main villain stumbling upon the protagonist's house, and the protagonist's father used to work for the villain many years previous. The villain recognizes him and tries to be buddies again, but the protagonist didn't know about their relationship.</p>

<p>The next one will be ""the villain isn't as great as he is portrayed in the beginning"".</p>
",34408,19-03-2018 16:01,Is including a large number of twists a bad thing?,"<p>I've been doing some research into twists, and after not knowing how to create one, I'm starting to get a handle on them. Unfortunately, now I'm at the other end of the spectrum, and wondering if I can have too <em>many</em> twists. </p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> To understand where I'm coming from, you have to know that I plan and develop my novels <em>extensively</em> before writing a single word. I know every little turn of the plot, every scene down to the dialogue said. <em>Then</em> I write it. </p>

<p>Creating novels this way allows me to look at the whole plot at once. Mark Baker's answer on <a href=""https://writers.stackexchange.com/questions/25921/how-can-i-get-in-the-habit-of-writing-with-twists"">this question</a> has introduced me to the concept of drifting off course so that I can <em>twist</em> back to the story. This means I just look at what I need for the story, then find a way to drift away from it so that I can twist to it. Yes! Twists abound! </p>

<p>I'm now realizing that doing that is going to yield a <em>lot</em> of twists, and I'm wondering if there is any problem with that. I want very much to simply say that the more twists the better, and here's why: </p>

<p>I recently finished reading the <em>SYLO Chronicles</em>, by D. J. MacHale. Excellent books, if a little lacking in the area of character development. What made them so great though was the unending twists. The entire setting was a mystery, and every chapter something changes, either making less sense, or making more sense in the wrong direction. Even the final chapter, after the main conflict was all over, was a twist simply through the writing (you'll have to read it; I won't spoil it). </p>

<p>The point is, I loved those books. Nothing was certain, there were twists everywhere, and I loved it. However, I realize that might not apply to all people. </p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is there anything wrong with including a large number of twists? I realize twists aren't for everybody. I know that. What I'm wondering is if there are any actual red flags concerning the number of twists to include. </p>

Is There a Legal Age to Publish a Manga/Comic?,"<p>Very recently I have thought of the question whether or not publishing a book at a younger age than 18 or 16 was possible, while it is of course possible to do this I began to think whether publishing a manga or comic was possible below a workng age too.</p>

<p>I know these days it's very hard to take a soon-to-be 15 year old very seriously given the state of mind in teenagers these days, and I know some people suggest going to family for advice when starting a big project and, believe me, I have tried, however all I seem to get are 'that's good' or a simple nod of the head which really can be a pain if you're looking for constructive criticism. I have planned to originally start this off as a webcomic, mainly posting it on sites such as DeviantART, but when doing this there is always a threat of someone taking individual pages of your comic/manga without permission and trying to sell it for themselves, which is understandable given how the current generation are too lazy to draw themselves, but I digress.</p>

<p>I know there probably isn't a legal age for this sort of thing and I might just be thinking on this a little too much, but another thing i'm worried about is the self-publishing and the traditional publishing. While I remain top of my class I was never good at marketing or being able to estimate good prices for anything, and it's a pain knowng a family member would have to sign contracts for you, especially if you're going to be using an alias, but i'm getting off-track again. Anyway however, I think that's all I really need to say, i'm guessing you all get the basic idea of what i'm trying to say. Detailed answers would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>But one thing before I end this question. I would like to shortly specify what i'm trying to say (or at least attempt at doing so).
   What I mean to say is: I know very many people thnk Manga or Comic writing isn't a real form of writing, and I can understand where they are coming from, but it is still clased as writing, therefor it is a profession. So, in simplifying the question, if there is no legal age to publish these sorts of things then what would be a good age to begin publishing them? Bear in mind however that I would like to publish this in the near future, the near future being a year or two from now.</p>

How to prevent seeming like a Marty Stu-ish villain is cheating?,"<p>In a story I'm writing, there's a villain who is a genius strategist that can get anything he wants, whatever it is, by developing perfect strategies that can have only two possible outcomes: 1, success, or 2, success. His plans never fail because he always has a plan B, and each plan B has a plan B, always thinking of all possibilities and things that can ruin his plan and coming with a solution to each one of them. If that's not enough, he's also a powerful, <em>almost</em> invincible fighter, heir of two special abilities. Oh, and he also becomes immortal (though he can get killed in a specific, story way), and is an emperor.  </p>

<p>In the end he is defeated by a flaw in his logic and a detail he didn't think about in one of his strategies (and by brute force too).</p>

<p>But sometimes you have the impression that he (the villain) is cheating, as he always figures out stuff and is always a step ahead and ends up winning, with no one able to defeat him in whatever way (except in the ending, along with specific story reasons), no matter what the heroes do, as if he is that invincible because the writer is ""helping"" him to achieve/win, and thus breaking the suspension of disbelief.</p>

<p>So how can I make it so that this <em>quasi</em>-invincibility or ""Marty Stu-ness"" is something to be amazed at, instead of something that breaks suspension of disbelief (besides justifying)?</p>

The world is still mostly the same and thus familiar to the reader, but an important part of the story is that a few things are radically different in subtle ways.</p>

<p>I wonder what some ways are to show those subtle differences without being too blunt?</p>

<p>Example: Let's say that in the future, TVs track how many people are watching and refuse to show certain content if too many people are watching.</p>

<p>My character could say <code>Man, remember in the old days when you could cram an entire classroom into your living room and just watch a movie? That new system sucks!</code>, but that is rather blunt.</p>

<p>One option is to have the characters run into the restriction head on: <code>Henry arrived late to the party. To the great anger of the group, the TV detected him as an additional viewer and refused to show any more until the extra group fee was paid</code>. </p>

<p>But it may not always be feasible to have the characters run into that restriction, sometimes I just want to show it's there without the characters really paying attention to it since to <em>them</em> it's perfectly normal.</p>

<p>While the exact solution greatly depends on the story, I wonder if there are established techniques for that?</p>

The protagonist learns their language and talks with them in it. </p>

<p>Movies (usually North American ones) set in another country, almost always have one or some characters who speak English, lowering the impact that the foreign language causes. However, the fiction I'm writing is quite long, and I think that only 2 or 3 characters who speak the protagonist's language throughout the whole story is quite inadequate.</p>

<p>Some parts of these movies have dialogs in the local language, but with subtitles. What about a written story? Provide the translation right after? That would be partially good only if these parts are few if compared to the whole story's dialogs, but that's not my case.</p>

<p>Also, fictions set in another country, but that don't have a change in the local language, are much easier than those that do have, because if, for example, the story is an adaptation from a Chinese story, anyone would know that though every character is speaking English, they would actually be speaking in the local language.<br>
But would this be possibly applicable to the situation when there's a country switch? All dialogs in the other country will be in the same language as the ones in the initial country? Wouldn't it be weird or unrealistic?
<hr>
<strong>EDIT:</strong><br>
Sorry, I think I didn't explained much clearly. I explain:<br>
The problem is the language in the dialogs, not the narration. This story involves a lot of dialogs, and the protagonist moves to another country and learns their language. The problem with this moving is the change in the language in the dialogs, that, in reality, would be another one. And my question is how to deal with this situation in the story. </p>

Self Publishing vs Mainstream Publisher,"<p>I am in the middle of writing my first non-fiction book and I am almost finished with designing my blog page discussing the subject I am writing about with small snippets of my writing.</p>

I think we've danced around the question a bit, but maybe it's time to look at it directly.  What are the pros and cons of different styles of publishing?</p>

<p>I'm thinking we could look at:</p>

<p>1) the Traditional route - get an agent, sell to the biggest publisher possible;</p>

<p>2) the small publisher route - skip the agent, find a publisher directly (maybe I'm wrong in assuming that this is likely to be a small publisher?);</p>

<p>3) the self-published route - probably e-books, but maybe POD as well;</p>

<p>4) the vanity publishing route;</p>

<p>5) creative, new approaches - serialization on the web, co-operative writers' groups... what else?</p>

<p>I know it's a big question, but maybe it would be good to have all the ideas gathered in one place.</p>

"I have characters, no plot","<p>I'm trying to write a story with characters that I already designed long ago and also have planned the world for them a bit, but I cannot come up with an interesting plot. What do you suggest I can do to come up with a plot?</p>
",36982,16-06-2018 21:54,How do I construct a plot out of my many setting/character details?,"<p>In my creative writing, I typically am inspired by short interactions between things: An overheard conversation. A person's jealousy of a friend's talent. A humorous misinterpretation...</p>

<p>I tend to begin with isolated ""scenes"" and generate a story from them, often going to great lengths to convey emotion and detail. I am often proud of my writing, except when I realize most of it is fragmented, unfinished, and likely never to be expanded.</p>

<p>My problem is that I don't think of plots. I don't generally begin from ""the big picture"" and determine what my protagonist must accomplish, or the obstacles to be overcome. I usually fail to think of an intriguing reason for the characters to be motivated.</p>

<p>Sadly, my collection is primarily of isolated studies of character interaction (or character development) rather than an inviting story with a beginning, climax, and resolution.</p>

<p>I would very much like to put some of these detailed character sketches and snippets into the framework of a completed novel. What are some ways in which writers come up with the overarching storyline? How can I create the ""outline"" for my writing in a way that will bring the necessary elements to bear? Is the conception of a great story line available only to creative talent or can it be learned?</p>

<p>To give an example, I have a short fantasy story in which the protagonist is a group of young adults that are given unique abilities (think <em>Heroes</em>). But when attempting to devise challenges for them or conjure a nemesis...the creativity in me vanishes. I don't want to ""copy"" similar stories' plots, but I realize I am unlikely to think of a unique narrative.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Is there a method to formulate the plot of a story that can be utilized when the author has only disconnected but detailed ideas for segments of the work?</strong></p>

Finding My Own Voice,"<p>It struck me today that one method of becoming a great writer could be to copy the style of one or more published authors. A bit like <em>standing on the shoulders of giants</em>.</p>

<p>I was therefore going to ask a question relating to the best way of doing so, but then I came across this: <a href=""https://writing.stackexchange.com/questions/4713/is-it-okay-to-attempt-to-write-in-the-style-of-another-person-and-how-is-that-d"">Is it okay to attempt to write in the style of another person, and how is that done well?</a> There is only one (short) answer: 'no, find your own voice.' So that got me thinking about what <em>my own voice</em> actually is.</p>

<p>I read a lot of books and it's quite likely that the way I write has already been influenced by other authors. My question is therefore: <strong>what's the best way of making sure that I am using my own voice when writing fiction (as opposed to just copying subconsciously from the style of others)?</strong></p>

Whenever I sit down to write something of my own immediately after marathoning a book or series, I tend to unconsciously use words, grammar, or style reminiscent of whomever I was just reading, since the “rhythm” of the text gets stuck in my head (for lack of a better way to phrase it). If I do this enough times on a single piece of work, it causes it upon reread to sound like a weird, jumpy mishmash of--for example--Tolkien, Christie, and Snicket. </p>

<p>This is not exactly the goal. </p>

<p>I know that taking inspiration from better writers than me is a good thing, but how do I stop accidentally imitating them? I like writing/being able to write in different styles, so I don't want to force myself into a single ""voice"" for everything I create, and I worry that being constantly conscious of or checking where my phrasing is coming from (and etc) will break my flow. However, I'd rather be consistent <em>within</em> pieces, and to not just copy, as unintentional as it is.</p>

<p>What are some tips to solve or mitigate this issue?</p>

<p>Are there other solutions - solutions that make sense, and do not break the antagonist's ""mastermind"" characterisation?</p>
",37254,26-06-2018 19:54,How to prevent seeming like a Marty Stu-ish villain is cheating?,"<p>In a story I'm writing, there's a villain who is a genius strategist that can get anything he wants, whatever it is, by developing perfect strategies that can have only two possible outcomes: 1, success, or 2, success. His plans never fail because he always has a plan B, and each plan B has a plan B, always thinking of all possibilities and things that can ruin his plan and coming with a solution to each one of them. If that's not enough, he's also a powerful, <em>almost</em> invincible fighter, heir of two special abilities. Oh, and he also becomes immortal (though he can get killed in a specific, story way), and is an emperor.  </p>

<p>In the end he is defeated by a flaw in his logic and a detail he didn't think about in one of his strategies (and by brute force too).</p>

<p>But sometimes you have the impression that he (the villain) is cheating, as he always figures out stuff and is always a step ahead and ends up winning, with no one able to defeat him in whatever way (except in the ending, along with specific story reasons), no matter what the heroes do, as if he is that invincible because the writer is ""helping"" him to achieve/win, and thus breaking the suspension of disbelief.</p>

<p>So how can I make it so that this <em>quasi</em>-invincibility or ""Marty Stu-ness"" is something to be amazed at, instead of something that breaks suspension of disbelief (besides justifying)?</p>

How to write a good sex scene specifically for erotica?,"<p>This is unlike the question <a href=""https://writing.stackexchange.com/q/14102/2533"">How to write good erotic scene?</a>, which refers to a sub-plot of a novel in which two characters had sex. There the accepted answer essentially evades any detailed descriptions of the act, by focusing on appearance, or feelings and specifically NOT about genitalia or the actions involved in having sex. Other respondents suggesting similar methods of ""hiding"" the sex scene, stopping with a kiss or embrace, and jumping to a point <em>after</em> the sex has happened. </p>

<p>In erotica, the whole reason the reader is reading is for a lengthy and detailed blow-by-blow sex scene, that is the nature of the genre, and the treatment of sex in a novel or R-rated movie defeats that purpose. The reader wants a fully imagined sex scene, genitalia, penetrations, orgasms, fluids, the whole thing. Perhaps for masturbation or perhaps as a scene to reenact with a willing partner for role-playing fun. (If you are put off by these purposes, this question is not for you!)</p>

<p>All of that said, I write erotica. Typically these stories have a setup and scenario which I can describe quite well. However, once I get to the... main event... I find it much too easy to fall into the trap of clichés about crashing waves and rolling eyes.</p>

<p>Characters who are well-educated would not be making grammatical mistakes and would not be mispronouncing words (in fact, you can expect them to speak the local version of ""Received Pronunciation""). They wouldn't use ""Ain't"", for example.</p>

<p>At the same time, children speaking among themselves, (as opposed to speaking to an adult,) would hardly use structured literary sentences - they would use colloquial speech.</p>

<p>Trouble is, <strong>colloquialisms can easily be timed and localised</strong> - they belong to a specific time (a specific century, or even a specific decade), and to a specific place.

And of course, I have no access to colloquialisms of the period I'm writing about.</p>

",37951,29-07-2018 21:57,I'm afraid of [accidental] plagiarism,"<p>I've recently written a screenplay about an alien invasion. A friend immediately commented that he found similarities (some general ideas, plot devices) with <strong>Half-Life 2: Ep 2</strong>, which I haven't even played - and from what he tells me, the similarities are striking.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I think 99% of alien invasion movies follow the same pattern - aliens invade, good guys regroup, good guys strike them with some success, aliens strike back with devastating effects, the heroes somehow save the day. There aren't that many unique plot ideas.</p>

<p>I'm afraid of doing anything with this screenplay, e.g. sending it to competitions, because of the ""original work"" clause, and the potential of getting sued. I'm 100% sure it's my original work as I've written 100% of it and the characters are original, but there's always the potential of someone saying <em>""wait, that's actually a screen adaptation of Half-Life 2, not your original work""</em>.</p>

<p>To complicate things further, I understand plagiarism must include ""an intention to deceive"". However, there's this company that makes <strong>Snakes on a Train</strong>, <strong>Transmorphers</strong> and <strong>Alien vs Hunter</strong> which <em>clearly</em> intend to deceive and profit from the more famous movie's publicity, and even in that case <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockbuster#Legality"">the response seems mild</a>.</p>

<p>I haven't wrote anything since maybe December of last year so I am very rusty on my work. I've been in writer's block for months and can't seem to escape it. I've tried doing the things I've used to like lighting candles and creating a nice atmosphere, listening to music and whatnot. But nothing seems to be working. </p>

<p>I've planned out most of the characters, the plot, the setting and world that I'm going to write about, but whenever I attempt to write everything just seems to vanish. I'm not expecting to get paragraphs of people telling me exactly what to write but maybe some of you have experienced what I am and know of a way to help push me out of this. Thanks in advanced.</p>

<p>I can't think of anything to write. Sometimes I stare at my screen for hours; doesn't help. </p>

<p>If I <em>do</em> think of something, it feels stupid, it won't work, it's cliche, etc. Can someone tell me what to do? Am I too anxious, have too high expectations, or trying to think too hard? I simply cannot write.</p>

<p>How do I get over this? Have other people coped with this problem successfully? How?</p>

And the book was not part of a series but a standalone? Artistically, I've always preferred bittersweet endings that leave things the teensiest bit unresolved, but if I were looking to sell, would I have to change that? I'd like to know beforehand so I can change the story before I finalize it. </p>

Writing about a topic which you don't have personal experience in,"<p>I would like to make it very clear that I'm very young (just graduated to a teen) and only an amateur writer. I have recently become seriously involved in writing in preparation for my IGCSE English Language exam. Part of the exam is to be able to whip up a sufficiently creative and unique piece (on a given topic/title) in under a hour. They are not grading us as teens; they are looking for actual writing quality at a level akin to that of a professional writer.</p>
<p>What I'm just doing is practicing writing short stories on many different topics and themes. This way I keep my creative writing skills fresh and in good use. Also, I get to experiment with a variety of ideas/themes, effectively preparing me for tackling whatever topic the exam board might throw.</p>
<p>Now the examiners are looking for something fresh and mature—pieces that deal with inherently deep issues (the likes of slavery and gender inequality) in a similarly sophisticated manner. But when it comes to sensitive topics like drug addiction or prostitution, how do I write about the theme convincingly and accurately enough without coming across as the naive kid that I am?</p>
<p>These are things which I don't have personal experience in and cannot connect with on an intimate level, and I'm afraid no amount of literary techniques or inspired writing can mask that. Yes, I could read up on writings by people who do have that experience, but I don't believe it would help make my writing any more genuine. It simply won't be the same as writing from personal experience.</p>
<p>Take the theme of a teen high on drugs for example. While I do have
somewhat of an idea on the effects of drugs and how they could
make you feel, I do not have any real experience with anything of that
sort.</p>
<p>Any attempts at coming up with anything decent about
drug use have resulted in something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I sighed when I plunged the syringe in. Bliss and bliss. And yet more bliss as the honey liquid trickled into me. I sighed once more as I let my arms ease onto the steel-cold handles. A warm, fuzzy feeling enveloped my insides.</p>
<p>And then it hit me, an urge that refused to let me off its crazed
hold. I needed to spin, spin, and spin. My skin was prickled all over
with lust as I gripped the handles and positioned my feet. So I did. I
spinned around in the chair.</p>
<p>Once. Twice. Thrice until I lost count. It was all a blur. The whole
of my office: socks all over the desk, the battered laptop on the
couch, soggy chips strewn all over the rug.</p>
<p>My eyes fell on the curtains. A deep, clear blue against the deep,
clear black of the starry sky beyond. Even the dull grey couch had
worked up a texture.</p>
<p>It was all so much more warm and wonderful this way. So I thought, jumping down from the chair which had been quite entertaining. I dropped with a thump onto the woolly, scruffy rug, the impact crushing quite a few of the chips that had been lying about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that is ridiculous prose.</p>
<h3>How do I get around my lack of knowledge on certain points and not let that affect the quality of my writing?  I'm asking in general, not specifically about drug use.</h3>
",39139,27-09-2018 06:05,How to creatively handle intoxication when you yourself haven't experienced such a thing?,"<p>Now I wouldn't call myself a true writer. I'm about 14 now and I'm currently preparing for my IGCSEs with a ton of subjects to juggle through and revise. English Language is one of the subjects, and in the paper, there is an entire section dedicated to creative writing. This section usually consists of 3-4 options for a creative writing task. Each option gives a topic/title to write either a descriptive essay, argumentative essay, or narrative essay on. Our teacher advises us to always choose writing a story (which would mean picking the narrative essay option), as apparently it's easier to pull more marks by virtue of the fact that you have a narrative at all.</p>
<p>So what I just do is practice writing short stories on loads of different topics and themes. This way I'll be keeping my creative writing skills fresh and in good use. Also, I get to experiment with a variety of ideas/themes, effectively preparing me for tackling whatever topic the exam board might throw (to write a story on).</p>
<p>Now the examiners are looking for something fresh and matured, pieces that deal with inherently deep issues (the likes of slavery and gender inequality) with a certain level of &quot;sophistication&quot; (for the lack of a better word). But when it comes to sensitive topics like drug addiction or prostitution, the problem is I might try to act like I really know what I'm doing but I will probably still end up coming across as the naive kid that I am. And I'm afraid no amount of literary techniques or genius writing can fix that. The &quot;sophistication&quot; element is what it'll lack.</p>
<p>I'm struggling to describe the experiences of an intoxicated teen specifically. This is the theme I'm working on at the moment. While I do have somewhat of an idea on the effects of alcohol/drugs and how they could make you feel, I do not have any real experience with anything of that sort. Yes, I could read up on writings by people who do have that experience, those who can connect with the topic on a personal level, but I don't think it still would help me pull it through. I simply cannot describe it as brilliantly and passionately as I could if I had tried those things firsthand.</p>
<p>All attempts at coming up with anything decent about intoxication have resulted in this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Impossible colours swirled in her head, blurring her senses. The technicolour blobs floating around in her subconscious drew her in. She could only gaze at those wondrous things in part fear and part awe.</strong></p>
<p>SNAP.</p>
<p>A rush of noise sounded, jolting her out of the reverie. She sat up bolt straight, whirling out of the silky, duvet sheets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soppy, ridiculous prose.</p>
<p>Of course, I don't actually write like that, nor is that a snippet from any actual piece of mine. Please don't bother analysing it. I was intentionally writing in purple for effect/emphasis—you needn't go and point that out to me. What I mean is that having nothing remarkable to write of intoxication, as I really don't know much about it, I worry that I will resort to covering it up with flowery, over-the-top language and florid imagery.</p>

The only times I managed to stay within the word count is when writing fanfic: I didn't need to do much of an introduction for the setting and the characters, and could thus dive directly into the story. Of course, not all competitions accept fanfic, and most of the time it wouldn't fit the theme of the competition in the first place.</p>

<p>Writing that is more concise can shave off about 10%-20% of what I've written without sacrificing story. But surely not 50% or more. So it would appear my stories are from the outset too big for the format.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Her eyes seemed to carry the same playful light that had emblazoned her smile. ""너 정말 이걸 원해?"" The woman asked in a light-hearted tone <em>Do you really want this?</em> It was a question the would possibly change the latter's life depending on his answer.</p>

<li><p>Write a Romanized version of the language. This could possibly come off as confusing or incorrect, or maybe offensive? e.g.: </p>

How can I indicate that a particular relationship between two male characters is purely brotherly (Philia) rather than romantic (Eros)?,"<p>One of the four forms of love Greek philosophy recognised, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philia"" rel=""noreferrer"">Philia</a> is usually translated as ""brotherly love"". It is the love between true friends. It was considered a ""higher form"" of love than <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eros_(concept)"" rel=""noreferrer"">Eros</a> - the romantic, sexual love. Philia is what Kirk and Spock shared, for example.</p>

<p>And the reason I chose Kirk and Spock as my example is of course the incredible amount of slash-fic that pairs those two together.</p>

<p><strong>How can I indicate that a particular relationship is all Philia, no Eros involved?</strong> The tricky thing is, it <em>is</em> love, not ""just"" friendship. I've written two characters who share a very strong emotional bond, they are more devoted to each other than they are to their wives. It's just not an ""Eros"" bond. I would have thought that the fact they both have wives would be enough, but for all that Kirk is <em>known</em> for ogling (to say the least) every female human or alien around, and never does he show any similar attraction towards men, he's still getting paired with Spock.</p>

<p>(To clarify, it's not that I have anything against LGBT characters. I've got several LGBT characters. It's just that sometimes two characters do not have Eros for each other. They have Philia. They share a strong emotional bond, in which sexual attraction plays no part. That's what my question is about. Nor am I implying that only men can experience Philia. But for some reason, a strong bond between female friends is accepted, whereas whenever men are involved, sexual overtones get added in.)</p>

<p>Philia is different from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_love"" rel=""noreferrer"">Platonic love</a>, to which <a href=""https://writing.stackexchange.com/q/35903/14704"">this question</a> relates: platonic love implies that physical attraction is at least possible, but decided against (see Wikipedia source). Philia is <em>deeper</em> than platonic love, or Eros, and has no Eros component even potentially. In a way, contrary to the other question, this <em>is</em> a love story - just not the romantic kind of love.</p>
",39669,26-10-2018 00:11,How do I convey that a relationship is platonic?,"<p>I've been toying around with the idea of writing a novel. The story revolves around two characters, one male and one female, and the perspective will shift between them.  </p>

<p>One of the central ideas of the story is that the two characters couldn't be any more different. They have different sets of talents, different world views, different ways of handling crises. Yet despite all that sets them apart, they're the best of friends. Nobody, including the two of them, can quite put into words <em>why</em> their friendship works as well as it does, but they're nonetheless inseparable.  </p>

<p>Here's the catch: This is <em>not</em> a love story. Both consider the other a close friend, but nothing more. It's not something they've ever considered, and their relationship won't ever become anything more than what it is. Unfortunately, every introduction for the two of them that I've come up with invariably feels like a cliched setup for a cheesy romance.  </p>

<p>I could directly call out the fact that they don't view each other in a romantic light, but that feels sloppy, and doesn't resonate very well. I'd rather show that they're just friends, rather than resort to directly summarizing how they feel about each other. I also don't want to introduce a different love interest for either one of them. In their eyes, they have each other, and that's about it.  </p>

<p>What's the best way for me to introduce their relationship, and not overtly hint at a future romance?</p>

Writing romance when I have little experience in it,"<p>I'm in high school, and have had few romantic relationships.  The few that I have had were very unhealthy.  I have pretty much no good experience with romance.</p>

<p>How can I write romance when I don't really know what it's like in real life?  How can I keep clichés out of my romance writing when clichés and media portrayal of relationships are literally the only ""normal"" romantic relationships that I've been exposed to?</p>

<p>EDIT: This question is <em>specifically</em> about how to write accurate and healthy romance when I haven't had healthy or real-world romantic relationships.  Technically I have in fact experienced romance and romantic feelings, I just don't know how to communicate something in my writing for which I have little knowledge of.</p>
",41805,31-01-2019 16:56,Writing about a topic which you don't have personal experience in,"<p>I would like to make it very clear that I'm very young (just graduated to a teen) and only an amateur writer. I have recently become seriously involved in writing in preparation for my IGCSE English Language exam. Part of the exam is to be able to whip up a sufficiently creative and unique piece (on a given topic/title) in under a hour. They are not grading us as teens; they are looking for actual writing quality at a level akin to that of a professional writer.</p>
<p>What I'm just doing is practicing writing short stories on many different topics and themes. This way I keep my creative writing skills fresh and in good use. Also, I get to experiment with a variety of ideas/themes, effectively preparing me for tackling whatever topic the exam board might throw.</p>
<p>Now the examiners are looking for something fresh and mature—pieces that deal with inherently deep issues (the likes of slavery and gender inequality) in a similarly sophisticated manner. But when it comes to sensitive topics like drug addiction or prostitution, how do I write about the theme convincingly and accurately enough without coming across as the naive kid that I am?</p>
<p>These are things which I don't have personal experience in and cannot connect with on an intimate level, and I'm afraid no amount of literary techniques or inspired writing can mask that. Yes, I could read up on writings by people who do have that experience, but I don't believe it would help make my writing any more genuine. It simply won't be the same as writing from personal experience.</p>
<p>Take the theme of a teen high on drugs for example. While I do have
somewhat of an idea on the effects of drugs and how they could
make you feel, I do not have any real experience with anything of that
sort.</p>
<p>Any attempts at coming up with anything decent about
drug use have resulted in something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I sighed when I plunged the syringe in. Bliss and bliss. And yet more bliss as the honey liquid trickled into me. I sighed once more as I let my arms ease onto the steel-cold handles. A warm, fuzzy feeling enveloped my insides.</p>
<p>And then it hit me, an urge that refused to let me off its crazed
hold. I needed to spin, spin, and spin. My skin was prickled all over
with lust as I gripped the handles and positioned my feet. So I did. I
spinned around in the chair.</p>
<p>Once. Twice. Thrice until I lost count. It was all a blur. The whole
of my office: socks all over the desk, the battered laptop on the
couch, soggy chips strewn all over the rug.</p>
<p>My eyes fell on the curtains. A deep, clear blue against the deep,
clear black of the starry sky beyond. Even the dull grey couch had
worked up a texture.</p>
<p>It was all so much more warm and wonderful this way. So I thought, jumping down from the chair which had been quite entertaining. I dropped with a thump onto the woolly, scruffy rug, the impact crushing quite a few of the chips that had been lying about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that is ridiculous prose.</p>
<h3>How do I get around my lack of knowledge on certain points and not let that affect the quality of my writing?  I'm asking in general, not specifically about drug use.</h3>

How to write a character speaking in broken english?,"<p>I found a slightly similar question from 2014 on here but a lot of the answers weren't helpful in my case (as they brought up points of the internet and such) so I'm going to try here...</p>

<p>In my creative writing class, I've been tasked with writing a historical fiction short story. I chose a point in WW1 with enemy forces interacting. As a native English speaker, I can, of course, write the British soldier no problem, but I'm having some issues with the German soldier.</p>

<p>I've done a ton of research and found out that much of Germany knew a little English around this time, however not much.</p>

<p>Basically, I'm having a lot of trouble trying to have a German character speak broken English in a way that is mostly able to be understood by the English speaker (so I don't need to have a lot of circumlocution) but also isn't extremely fluent in a way that would make it seem fake and unrealistic. </p>

<p>I hope this makes sense?</p>
",39230,05-10-2018 03:13,How do I make an ESL character sound realistic?,"<p>I have to write an assignment in which there's an English character talking with a English as a Second Language (ESL) character. It is turning out really, really badly. I have a general idea of what the characters need to say to each other to advance the plot, but I can't get the characters to sound realistic. Well... the English one does, but the ESL character doesn't. He just sounds like an English speaker who doesn't really speak English well. He's supposed to be good enough to get by, but not fluent in English. I'm interested in psychology, and I thought I would be able to use that to help me better create this character, <em>but</em> that hasn't seemed to work either.</p>

<p>The ESL character is of Asian descent (but I haven't picked from where the character originates, so I'm not really able to ask for specifics or anything) and in order to gain an understanding of what people from Asian countries who learn English are like, I talked to a friend who is Japanese (and a psychology minor, she's the one who gave me some psychology paperwork to look into on the subject of language affecting thoughts and speech). </p>

<p>She pointed me to some studies (they're books and I can't find great references on Google but basically things like <a href=""http://www.cogsci.northwestern.edu/cogsci2004/papers/paper575.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>) where language is brought up as something that influences thought. The example I gave talks about time, but there are <a href=""http://www.linguisticsociety.org/files/Does_Language_Influence.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">other papers</a> that could probably be more sufficient. The idea was that if I could find studies on how language affected thought in whatever language I chose for this guy's native language, I could use the studies to make general changes to his dialogue to make him seem more realistic (instead of my character saying ""X broke the vase"", he would say ""The vase broke"" since English speakers tend to assign blame more than Asian speakers do, for example). </p>

<p>I also talked to my friend to learn about her experience in learning English, but she's fluent in English now (so I can't pick up on how she speaks for my character) and says it's hard to remember the kinds of mistakes she made-- she said she remembers just being wrong all the time and now looking back it's hard to pinpoint any one time that taught her anything important. Other people I've talked to have less problems remembering mistakes, but I just can't get my character to sound right even with their help. He sounds too fluent.</p>

<p>Thus far, this is what I've gleaned from research:</p>

<ul>
<li>Few contractions, if any.</li>
<li>Little slang. Difficulty using slang words that are often used like ""gonna"" or ""dunno"" if particularly weak at English</li>
<li>Tag questions. Most of them are affirmation types, asking for corrections and so forth.</li>
<li>Incorrect tenses, but it depends on how far along in English the character is. Irregular verbs are more difficult, but also past progressive tenses and things like that aren't bound to be completely understood. </li>
<li>If puns/idioms are used, often they should be directly translated from the native language.</li>
<li>Simple, short sentences</li>
<li>Professional sounding English, since they aren't taught colloquial English</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't know what else to do. If anyone has advice on how to make an ESL character sound realistic, I would appreciate it.</p>

New planet, maybe new species, complex society with complex rules, history, government, and so on. Some of these details are absolutely necessary to understand the plot of the story.</p>

<p>There are two ways to give this information to the reader.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Prologue of some kind:</strong> Anne McCaffrey had this in the beginning of her original dragon trilogy, explaining how humans came to Pern, what dragons were in this context, what Thread was (both in scientific reality and what it meant to the Pernese), and how things had changed and developed to leave the society as it was when the story opened. David &amp; Leigh Eddings did something similar for the Belgariad and Malloreon series, although theirs were more faux historical documents, with each book's prologue having a different tone and style and giving a different piece of history. </li>
<li><strong>Jump in and learn along the way:</strong> Mercedes Lackey's Arrows of the Queen trilogy just starts, and we learn about the society and Companions as the same time as the 13-year-old narrator.</li>
</ol>

<p>My question is: Where is the tipping point between explaining the world as the narrator is introduced and the story gets underway, and setting the scene before the story starts so that you're not infodumping and having characters say ridiculously obvious things for the reader's benefit? </p>

<p>At what point is a world so complex that you kind of have to explain some of it before getting underway? Is it always ""lazy"" to have this kind of prologue? </p>

",43061,05-03-2019 23:26,How to make the villain relatable/human without making the hero seem like a monster for killing him?,"<p>I have a story I'm writing which has a villain that, in order to make him more human/developed, I gave him a relatable, tragic and/or disturbing life story, gave him plenty of reasons to be who he is and do what he does (understandable or almost), and made him the hero of his own story. </p>

<p>For story reasons, he <em>needs</em> to be killed, and also kind of <em>deserves</em> this because of his deeds. ""Kind of"" because his reasons and story makes very blurred the line between evil and simple cause and effect, so it's not that simple to just say that he did what he did ""because he is evil"". However, I don't have the intention of making his death an emotional moment, because he is supposed to be seen as unlikable, an unlikable character that has a point, a victim that becomes a perpetrator. The hero, although having more positives than negatives, isn't a saint either, having at least a bit of the blame (or at least in the villain's vision). </p>

<p>And here comes the problem. This story is the first of a trilogy where this hero is the protagonist. I think that the hero needs to be likable the most possible to make the reader urge to read more about him. Previously, I asked <a href=""https://writing.stackexchange.com/questions/34480/how-to-prevent-turning-off-the-reader-at-first-with-a-protagonist-with-unlikeabl"">questions</a> regarding <a href=""https://writing.stackexchange.com/questions/30593/the-more-fleshed-out-the-character-is-the-more-the-reader-will-care-about-him"">problems</a> with this same hero's likability. I was having these problems because I was incorrectly characterizing/developing this character. Now that it <em>seems</em> that I got it right, and now that the villain is also well developed, now <em>the villain</em> is making the hero seem unlikable for killing him. If this was a one-shot fiction, such ambiguity of who is the real hero would be great, it would be amazing, but the problem is that there's still two sequels with this protagonist to go, and I can't simply discard them just because of some mere details in the first title.</p>

<p>So how can I make the villain sympathetic without affecting the hero's likability for killing him?
<hr>
<strong>Edit:</strong><br>
I think I forgot to include in my question a very important detail of my problem, and I need to clarify what I meant in my question. By ""hero of his own story"" I really mean ""hero of <strong><em>his own</em></strong> story"", as the villain is a narcissist. He's not doing any good to <em>other</em> people, the only one benefited with his actions is <em>his ego</em>. So it's not a case of ""doing the right thing to other people the wrong way"", but instead it's ""doing the wrong thing the wrong way towards other people, <em>having as final intended effect the satisfaction of his own ego</em>"". The villain sees no reason why he doesn't have the complete right to do what he wants, and the story shows that he indeed is not totally wrong, but the means he used are too extreme for ""solving"" <em>his</em> problem. 
<hr>
<strong>Edit 2:</strong><br>
After reading the answers and thinking about this matter, it downed on me that actually the villain isn't as sympathetic and the hero isn't as ""monstrous"" as I was thinking. I think I got so much in the villain's head that I started to think just like him, seeing the villain as a hero or someone worthy of sympathy, and seeing the hero as a villain or someone unlikeable. I think that's why I was having this problem. Now I don't see the villain as positively as when I asked this question, especially because what he does is wrong no matter his reasons or what caused him to be that way, so it makes no sense to see the hero as unlikable for him simply doing what is necessary.<br>
Also, Dan J.'s and Seserous' answers were spot-on on this matter, because even though the hero just does what needs to be done, he did that coldly and with wrath, that's another reason why it was leaving a negative impression on him for killing the villain.</p>

"When a story is longer than a book, is it best to wait until the entire story is done before completing the first book in the story?","<p>I have been working on a <em>story</em> for several years. The manuscript is now currently longer than 1,000 notebook pages (roughly 615 pages in print by my calculations) and it’s only a third of the way through the plot. So, I’ve known for a while that this is going to end up being multiple <em>books</em> when it’s completed. I recently decided to take a break from writing the <em>story</em> to finish the first <em>book</em> in what will likely be either a trilogy or tetralogy. This first <em>book</em> is around 315 pages. So my question is, <strong>Is it a good idea to self-publish a completed first book in what will be a longer series even though the remainder of the story has not yet been written?</strong></p>

<p>To add some clarification, I am not writing the story as if it is going to be divided into smaller books, I’m writing it as if it is one really long book. I’m dividing it wherever it seems logical to do so based on plot and book-length. At this time I know where I want the story to go, I have an idea of what information I want to be covered in each book, and I’ve even gone as far as to create a detailed plot chart outlining what is going to happen and when. Most sections of the story I’ve already written and re-written in my head hundreds of times so now it’s just a matter of putting it all to the paper, which I fully intend to do. </p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Woohoo! The time has come, my <em>first book of a trilogy</em> is one chapter away from finishing. I've done a little editing as I go, clearing up the bad chapters, but haven't properly gone through the whole thing or anything.</p>

<p>Firstly, I saw <a href=""https://writers.stackexchange.com/questions/3513/write-to-the-finish-or-edit-as-you-go"">this question</a>, an interesting question, but I'm thinking about not one book... a trilogy. Or a series of any length, really.</p>

<p>So, I was wondering whether I should write the entire series first then edit or write one book, edit that to perfection, then the second one, edit that to perfection, so on and so on. I'm beginning to lean towards writing the entire series, because I'll have the entire thing to work with, but I'm really on the fence right now. I just can't decide, this is an impossibly tricky dilemma.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should I write my books and edit them one by one. For example, I write the first book, perfect it, write the second book, perfect it, so on and so forth. Or, should I write all the books (without editing them) and then perfect the complete work?</p>

How do we properly show that a person is talking at the same time as something or someone else?,"<p>I am not sure how to best handle this, do we skip over a part of the dialogue? When a person is cut, he can resume, but it's not the same thing for a TV.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's an example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The TV blurted out a news report: ""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and
  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer offering a joint statement saying
  Trump's call for the additional border wall funding will be dead on
  --""</p>
  
  <p>John who was in a bad mood talked over the news report: ""Always, the
  same damn thing.""</p>
  
  <p>The TV continued: ""regarding his national security declaration, and
  telling them to, quote, get tough. OK.  So, Greg, a budget takes
  months to prepare.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here's the full excerpt of the TV transcript:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer
  offering a joint statement saying Trump's call for the additional
  border wall funding will be dead on arrival. The president tweeting
  today, the Republican have a, quote, very easy vote this week,
  regarding his national security declaration, and telling them to,
  quote, get tough. OK.  So, Greg, a budget takes months to prepare --</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, what's a better way to handle this?</p>

<p>It's a different question, because I am asking about a non-person ""speaking"" at the same time.</p>
",43474,14-03-2019 01:30,simultaneous dialogues in novels and short fiction,"<p>Suppose that several individuals are speaking. There are two conversations occurring at once in the same place. Both are heard simultaneously by each person that is present. Each person participates in one and only one conversation. </p>

<p>How does one write dialogue so that it is obvious without explanation that both explicitly quoted speeches occur at once, but without violating conventional grammar? </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>QUESTION</strong>: Specifically, does (1) or (2) as literally heard by the perspective character (PC) violate modern grammar? Which one if any---and in that case, how can it be rewritten without such a violation, yet without rewriting it into (3)? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>*COROLLARY**: Are there published modern precedents in novels or short fiction regarding dual but explicit dialogue?</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> There is the em dashery from <em>Tristram Shandy</em>:</p>

<p>""So I told him---This salad is floating---that he doesn't know how---in its dressing!---to fix cars. I look at it and---He needs to get---it's disgusting!---a professional to look at it."" Tom spits in the salad and goes on complaining. Janice continues speaking to Bob---who nods and smiles periodically. I don't believe that he can hear what she's saying.</p>

<p><strong>OR</strong></p>

<p><em>2)</em> There is the symbolic indication of simultaneousness via brackets:</p>

<p>""So I told him that he doesn't know how to fix cars,"" says Janice. (""This salad is floating in its dressing,"" Tom complains. ""I look at it and---"" he spits in the salad.) </p>

<p>""He needs to get a professional to look at it."" (""It's disgusting."")</p>

<p>Bob looks at Janice and nods and smiles periodically. I don't believe that he can hear what she's saying.</p>

<p><strong>OR</strong></p>

<p><em>3)</em> One can summarize who says what and when, or write explicitly the loudest dialogue and summarize what is also said, or separate the speeches and join them with a while clause. For instance</p>

<p>""So I told him that he doesn't know how to fix cars,"" says Janice. ""He needs to get a professional to look at it,"" she tells Bob.</p>

<p>""This salad is floating in its dressing!"" Tom complains while Janice speaks. ""I look at it and---"" he spits in the salad. ""It's disgusting.""</p>

<p>Bob looks at Janice and nods and smiles periodically. I don't believe that he can hear what she's saying.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>However this cannot achieve the effect which simultaneous dialogues can achieve</em>:</p>
  
  <p>Now I agree: following several overlapping conversations at once is typically confusing if not usually impossible. That's also the point. </p>
  
  <p>""It's noisy and she cannot understand anything that is said ..."" is unclear and vague; the reader isn't given the information they need to visualize any realistic group interactions that cause the noisiness mentioned---if that's all the writer tells them. (I am aware that some authors have suggested that many scenes do not need to be capable of being visualized ... ) </p>
  
  <p>Several conversations at once that are described as they are heard by the PC is a technical device. It allows the author to reveal information where the PC is present and yet the PC is plausibly unaware of this information despite they fact that they are present there in fact. They hear it but they also have a reason in that context to be insufficiently attentive or incapable of parsing it. (That is not true about the readers, who are made aware of it, because those conversations which are difficult to follow in real time are typically more easily parsed and followed if they are read not heard.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>If I were to identify the speakers explicitly, so that it is not a cacophony like in the case above where the listener is tired and uninterested, I could follow Vollmann's lead, I suppose. But is this really much better?</p>

<p>So I told him---says Janice.</p>

<p>This salad is floating---Tom observes.</p>

<p>That he doesn't know how---Janice continues.</p>

<p>In its dressing! Tom raises his voice, attempting to be heard. ""It's disgusting.""</p>

<p>To fix cars, concludes Janice. ""He needs to see a professional for help.""</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tom spits in the salad.</p>

",43624,16-03-2019 12:08,What is generally the accepted format style for telepathic communication in the midst of verbal communication?,"<p>At this point in my story, it's already been revealed that 2 characters share a telepathic link with one another that allows them to communicate to each other with their minds.</p>

<p>&quot;How do you know it's me in here?&quot; Kabaru asked, her voice distorted by the vocal mask inbuilt into her helmet. <em>&quot;Yulia, help?&quot;</em><br/><br/>
<em>&quot;I told you off for the same thing too remember? Don't be surprised if Rise starts beating you with her staff after this now that she know the truth.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Hitagi turned her head sharply glaring at Yulia. &quot;Knock it off. I know you're both using that telepathy thing.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see currently when I want to show that a conversation is occurring in the minds of characters, I use italics (plain text wise I use <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tags to show where it goes). This way it distinguishes this from the vocal stuff with having to repeatedly say &quot;he/she said in his/her mind.&quot;</p>
<p>Is this the generally the accepted format style for telepathic communication in the midst of verbal communication? If not, and if there is one, what would be the general format style for this?</p>

How to make sure that my reader has not forgotten an incident or character which was described earlier and referenced much later in the writing?,"<p>In the context of writing a fiction novel, how to make sure that readers remember several of the incidents or events or even characters that were described in earlier chapters, when the same gets referenced in the much later part? </p>

<p>I have also experienced this myself as a reader, especially in mystery novels where a minute detail or character described <em>earlier</em> ends up as a dramatic, concluding climax <em>later</em>. Reader gets a sense of being lost as they happen to forget such things either because they think <em>that</em> description or character in picture, was <em>just a setting buildup</em> or <em>was not too necessary to be remembered throughout</em>.</p>

<p>I have gotten some critics about this point of view, that it seems ""wrong"", which I sort of understand where it comes from, since it is a very limited point of view, but I think it is nice since I can fully show the discrepancies in the characters limited view of the world, and that is the main focus for instance.</p>

<p>However, I'm planning to have a third person omniscient point of view for describing important events in the future.</p>

<li>There are <strong>Clues</strong> which may or may not go somewhere, and must be interpreted by the protagonist to have any meaning.</li>
<li>There are <strong>Witnessess</strong> who serve both to bring light to the case or muddle it further.</li>
<li>There are <strong>Misdirections</strong> normally due to simple human nature that can cause someone to seem guilty.</li>
<li>There are <strong>Leads</strong> which are advancements in the plot as the protagonist makes sense of everything else</li>
<li>And there are <strong>Culprits</strong> which are responsible for whatever the protagonist is investigating.</li>

Does IDE-like writers' software exist?,"<p>This question is somewhat inspired by <a href=""https://writing.stackexchange.com/questions/45035/is-there-a-need-for-better-software-for-writers"">Is there a need for better software for writers?</a></p>

<p>I'm currently using Google Docs for writing, and it's a great tool: simple enough, has some nice features, cloud-based, free, etc. But the question I've mentioned above made me think, what if I could use some super-powers that IDE gives to programmers to help me write? (Yep, I do write code for living as well.)</p>

<p>While there seem to be a lot of writers who want to (or need to) have an advanced map of characters, locations, and events, there are also those who don't. I am a very text-first writer, and I'm comfortable with having the map in my head. The main problem for me (the one that I'm trying to solve) is that I don't always remember what exactly I wrote about my characters, especially about episodic characters. So I need a way to quickly look-up whether some guy has a straight hair or curly, or what colour his eyes are. Stuff like that.</p>

<p>I've tried several different writing tools and none of them has any IDE-ish features that I'd like to have. But maybe it exists and I just can't find it?</p>

<p>So, here's a list of features I need from an IDE:</p>

<ul>
<li>Formatting support (basically RTF level, no need for super-fancy stuff)</li>
<li>Some cloudness (either their own, or Google Drive sync)</li>
<li><strong>Available for Mac</strong> (would be super-cool if also available for Windows)</li>
<li>Ability to organize chapters into folders (tree structure)</li>
<li>Spell-checker (That's a tough one as I'm writing in Russian and I need a spell-checker for Russian). It might not have its own spell-checker, but it should then allow 3rd-party ones to work with it.</li>
<li>Character list</li>
<li><strong>IDE-like reference tool</strong> (that's actually what gDocs totally lacks)</li>
<li>""Find in project"" would also be a nice feature, especially if it'd support regExps</li>
<li><strong>Should either be free or have a free trial</strong>, as I'm not buying a cat in a sac</li>
</ul>

<p>A bit of explanation of what an 'IDE-like reference tool' is:</p>

<ol>
<li>It should allow me to quickly create character from selected text. 
For example, in chapter 1 I have a sentence ""Sally Brown, a tall blonde girl, was waiting for her work day to end"". I'll select ""Sally Brown"", press some key combination, and there will be a character creation window or panel, to which I can copy the description).</li>
<li>It should also allow ""binding"" a character to the selected text.
For example, in chapter 2 I have a sentence ""Sally stormed into the office and started shouting"". Cmd+hover over the word ""Sally"" and the IDE should suggest something like ""Did you mean Sally Brown (tall blonde girl from chapter 1)?"") </li>
<li>Once the text is bound to a character, it should be highlighted and I should be able to hover it (or cmd+hover, or cmd+click, or whatever) to see a tooltip or a small window with character info (including chapters where she can be found).</li>
</ol>

<p>Does something like this exist?</p>

<p>The locked question <a href=""https://writing.stackexchange.com/questions/9/is-there-a-special-software-for-writers"">Is there a special software for writers?</a>) is similar, but it has no details about what writing software can and can't do, and answers provide an unsortable list of distraction-free editors, mind-mapping tools and writing IDEs (for the lack of a better term). This question however is much more specific.</p>
",45094,09-05-2019 23:04,Is there a special software for writers?,"<p>Whenever I attempt to write something, I do it in a common word processor (like Microsoft Word), but I was wondering if there is a special software for it.</p>

<p>Something that would help me keep track of the story lines, times, and characters in an easy and organized way as to not get lost in my own story</p>

End punctuation when using quotation marks,"<p>When do you put the end punctuation of a sentence inside or outside of quotation marks including the last word of the sentence?</p>
",45135,12-05-2019 06:35,Period outside quotation marks ...?,"<p>I am quoting a phrase (not dialog) that happens to come at the end of a sentence. Formal writing protocol - I think - tells us that punctuation goes inside the quotes but it seems strange here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A gangster might channel The Godfather movies by proclaiming ""he sleeps with the fishes."" Of course we all know what this means.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now then - if the quote was inside the sentence, there would be no need for a period near it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A phrase like ""he sleeps with the fishes"" is common among old style gangsters. Of course we all know what this means.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, in other words - the period is not inherently part of the quoted phrase- the period is to indicate the end of the sentence - yet it seems just as strange outside the quotes</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A gangster might channel The Godfather movies by proclaiming ""he sleeps with the fishes"". Of course we all know what this means.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And something is missing if I leave out the period, altogether:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A gangster might channel The Godfather movies by proclaiming ""he sleeps with the fishes"" Of course we all know what this means.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not looking for ways to restructure the sentences or reword. Above is just a made-up example.  I'm looking for advice or consensus as to the proper placement of the period within the quotations - particularly when another sentence follows it.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

How to write that a character waits a certain amount of time?,"<p>Let's say the character of the story has to wait a day and you need to write in the  story in a smooth manner that they waited the day for the thing they were expecting? </p>
",45195,16-05-2019 02:44,"How do I cleanly show the passage of time, with multiple, varying time scales?","<p>I was re-reading <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</em> recently to get a feel for the way J.K. Rowling passes an entire year in a fairly short book that feels content packed, and I noticed something <em>very</em> common which I hadn't previously put any thought to.</p>

<p>With respect to the passage of time, the book's voice changes drastically here and there. For many pages it follows the second-to-second real-time actions of the character, e.g. a passage describing a conversation or a duel.</p>

<p>But at other times the narrator zooms out and passes hours in a sentence, like so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe this seems simple, or obvious, but I think it's a tiny piece of brilliance, and something that all good writers can do and frequently <em>do</em> do but which does not necessarily come easily to new writers and which maybe many people don't think about.</p>

<p>I see this happen with days, weeks, months, even years. And it isn't trivial to just drop it in there. In fact I've found it's very easy to interrupt the flow of your writing by shifting the rate of time passage in anything less than the smoothest manner.</p>

<p>So the question is: how can you cleanly shift time scales and avoid making a somewhat jarring break in temporal continuity? How can you go from following a character second-to-second to briefly relating what the character did over the afternoon, the summer, the rest of his forties? Tips/Exercises for practice are always good, if anyone knows any clever ones.</p>

<p>Here is the backstory: The main character is a boy from a lower class family. He got a chance to go to another big city and attend a prestigious school. In the school every other child is from a much higher class society and family. So the boy is most likely to be bullied and that turned out to be true. </p>

<p>There is also a girl character who is super popular in that school. I want my main character and this girl character to fall in love with each other, but not finding a reasonable way to tie most popular girl to the most bullied boy ever. ALSO, the girl character is not the motherly type creature in general. So I can't make her fall in love with him out of kindness and generosity. No, the girl character is not mean. I meant she isn't that kind of girl who will notice a bullied person and necessarily feel like helping him. Also I don't want her to be in Love with him out of sympathy, that would be pathetic. She is actually a trouble maker kind of girl but she is also very playful, funny and childish. </p>

How can I showcase the dynamic relationship between two personalities?,"<p>The protagonist, as a child, was born into an eldritch cult which worships the being known as shub-niggurath. His parents chose him to be an unwilling participant in a sacrificial ritual, using his body to possess a demon. The majority of the cult was destroyed, but aspects of it survived. He was determined to make his own way in the world, moving away from his sinister past.</p>

<p>Ever since his possession, he has felt urges that he struggles to control. As he gets older, these urges become stronger and harder to resist, to the point where the mask occasionally slips and he becomes the monster he was destined to be. There is a part of him that enjoys it, which he is ashamed to admit. Certain things happen which forces him to accept that his situation is the result of one of two possibilities:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The demon that is inside him is getting more powerful and will eventually take control fully. It forces him to do horrible things and makes him enjoy it, trying to push him to do worse things in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>The original person died on that alter, replaced by a being that is neither the original host or demon, but a new entity entirely. This being thinks it is a human and blames the evil things it does on a split personality to ease it's conscience. In truth, it enjoys every minute of it and tells itself lies to take away it's guilt, delaying the inevitable point where it completely embraces the darkness.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The protagonist is unaware of why he is turning evil or how to stop it, and isn't really sure if he really wants to. This is the inner conflict he has with himself, and it is driving him mad. How can I make this work in writing and highlight the inner, constant turmoil?</p>

He has desires that are difficult to control, and must constantly battle them lest they take over. Thoughts of committing murder, torture, and other evil acts are whispered into his mind by this demonic side, which manifests as an alter ego that seeks to take control over him. The two beings in one body maintain a dialogue, with the demon wanting to be let out and pushing him toward evil. This human sometimes obliges the demon in order to gain use of its powers. However, it finds it increasingly difficult to gain back control and lock the demon back up.</p>

<p>My protagonist is a skilled character whose powerful traits allow him to succeed continuously throughout the story. He is challenged by foes along the way, but he eventually overcomes them all. By the end, he encounters the main antagonist, his worst nightmare. This is where the plot twist comes into play. The protagonist begins to overpower the antagonist, but in a shocking turn of fate, the protagonist is defeated. This is not a plot twist in the sense that the protagonist turns out to be a “bad guy” all along, but rather one where the protagonist is clearly expected to win until the very last second where the antagonist wins by luck, so to speak. </p>

<p>So I am wondering, is this in general a poor way to end a story, or an effective one? Would this kind of ending make sense, or would it be too sudden and immediately turn off the reader? Should any instances of foreshadowing be implicated in order to ever so slightly predict the protagonist’s eventual demise, or would it best go down as a surprise moment?</p>

It's just a personal project now and I've gone really in depth to clean up any plot holes I can readily see (thanks Cinemasins). I think I love this story almost as much as I love my boyfriend; it's a fanfiction (not the gross kind, a bringing-back-a-short-lived-90s-show-from-the-dead-because-it-was-great kind) of Ed Edd N Eddy. I'm in the editing stage now cuz this book needed a glow up, and I just finished the first chapter. </p>

<p>Based on Grammarly, it is 7,812 words long and has a 30 minute reading time and a 1 hour speaking time. My aunt, who is a 3rd grade teacher and doesn't seem to read more than the average elementary school chapter book, told me it was much too long and a chapter should only be about 10 pages long. This isn't an elementary school chapter book, and not even a middle school one. It's a book for Ed Edd N Eddy lovers to keep the show alive in their mind. My aunt seems to want me to feel bad but I still really love what I'm doing and it's making me happy. That's all that matters, isn't it? Should I really cut it down or is it fine to keep it how it is? It all seems to flow together, and when I read it, it didn't feel like it was that long.</p>

<p>Example: Let's say that in the future, TVs track how many people are watching and refuse to show certain content if too many people are watching.</p>

<p>My character could say <code>Man, remember in the old days when you could cram an entire classroom into your living room and just watch a movie? That new system sucks!</code>, but that is rather blunt.</p>

<p>But it may not always be feasible to have the characters run into that restriction, sometimes I just want to show it's there without the characters really paying attention to it since to <em>them</em> it's perfectly normal.</p>

I like to use 1st person because it feels personal and informal, but using third person allows me to (a) avoid sounding like I am bragging[1], (b) reconnect the reader with our name, and (c) speak about our historical activities -- the ""we"" now were not part of the ""we"" in 1980.

How can I make sure a major twist is not disappointing?,"<p>I've been having some trouble with the ending of my current story, and I've decided that the best way to deal with those issues is to include a major twist. Due to the nature of this twist, I'm not sure if the reader will like it, or just be disappointed. Here's the scenario: </p>

<p>The basic plot of the story is that the main character is a prisoner on a planet ruled by intelligent robots with advanced technology. It's not as unoriginal as it sounds. The character gets unintentionally teleported to a different planet, in a different time. It is important to note that this story is a fan fiction based on the story of a game, and this event is part of that story, and therefore thoroughly expected. This is not the twist. </p>

<p>Following the general story of the game, the character goes through several battles and missions on this new planet. He meets characters who change him, and the way he sees things. He realizes some things about himself. </p>

<p>While on this new planet, the character has one goal: to get back to his home, and the woman he loves. However, he eventually learns that the people on the new planet need his help, and that leaving them to achieve his goal would be selfish. He has decided that that's something he cannot do. </p>

<p>The trouble is that there are now two stories on two separate planets. For story reasons, they cannot cross over. I cannot, for example, bring the woman the main character loves to the new planet, or vice versa. I can end the conflicts on the new planet in a climax, and then send the character back, but the climax will have already happened, leaving everything back on the home planet as feeling like extra (there is a separate climax there as well, but it consists mainly of dialogue). </p>

<p>I have decided that the best way to deal with these problems is with a twist: just before the main character would have the final battle with the antagonist of the new world, everything goes black. He wakes up. It turns out the whole thing was just a matrix-like simulated test the advanced robots were running on him. </p>

<p>This certainly fixes the problems. The unresolved conflicts of the new world don't matter because they were never real. There is only one climax, on the home world. </p>

<p>There's only one question: will the reader think this is a great twist, or just be disappointed that all they were reading before that actually never happened? </p>

<p>The character has learned things. He has changed due to his experiences. But those experiences never actually happened. The people he met never existed. Perhaps most importantly, the climax which everything on the new world was building up to never happened. It is true that the protagonist's main goal of getting back home never changed, and that he spent the majority of his time on the new world trying to get back. It was only at the end that he became invested in the war on the new world, and decided he had to stay. Nonetheless, the reader was expecting a fight to the death on the new world. That fight never came. </p>

<p>So that's my question: <strong>is there a way I can make sure a major twist isn't disappointing?</strong> Is there perhaps a list of do's and don't's? Of things to watch out for maybe? </p>

<p>Note: This cannot be answered by <a href=""https://writing.stackexchange.com/a/25922/10394"">this answer</a>. That answer explains what a twist really is and how it really works. This question is dealing with whether or not a twist of the kind I have outlined above will disappoint the reader. The two questions are similar only in the respect that they are both about twists. In all other respects, they are completely different questions. You could say the linked questions deals with how to create twists, while this question deals with how to prevent the reader from feeling like he's been lied to when the twist is revealed. </p>

<p>Further Note: After due consideration, I have decided that the answer <a href=""https://writing.stackexchange.com/a/25922/10394"">here</a> is in fact the best answer. It doesn't directly answer this question, but one can infer from it that to make a twist satisfying, it must twist <em>back</em> to the most emotionally satisfying storyline, and the twist itself must be more emotionally satisfying than what would have happened without the twist. </p>
",34172,10-03-2018 18:39,How can I get in the Habit of Writing with Twists?,"<p>I've always felt that my writing is very sequential. It's a chain of events. This happens, then this happens, then this happens, and so on. Not to say that the events are boring, but I just always felt that something was missing. </p>

<p>I'm a plotter, which means I outline my story extensively before I start to write it. I have a process that I use to create the outline, which focuses on all the parts I need, like character development and stakes, plus all the rest. One thing it does not focus on is twists. I guess twists somehow never came up when I was studying how to write. </p>

<p>What can I do to get in that mindset, so that including twists in my novels and outlines becomes a habit? Should I just start writing short stories (not for publishing) and focus on twists? Or is there some sort of exercise that I can do? </p>

How to ensure that neurotic or annoying characters don't get tiring in the long run,"<p>A is a special snowflake, though for all the wrong reasons. You see, he was born with a special ability that allowed him to see premonitions of his and his loved ones' future in the form of still images. Of course, future here isn't immutable, and premonitions change as new information comes in.</p>

<p>While the ability is incredibly powerful, watching artistic renditions of his many possible deaths took a toll on A's mental health, making him reclusive, and neurotic. He became obsessed with fate and thinks it's out to get him ""because his ability upsets the natural order"". A could rarely ever tell others about his ability as it could change the premonition in unexpected ways. From the outsiders' perspective, he sometimes just gets the Thousand-yard stare and begins screaming, only to calm down later and refuse to tell why he freaked out.</p>

<p>Though it's not his fault, I'm still afraid the reader would get tired of A's antics, regardless that they can actually see his premonitions. Saying 'Poor A, he unwittingly pushes everyone away from himself"" without ever seeing him do that is disingenuous and is considered poor writing. <strong>I don't want to change how his charcter is, only how it's presented.</strong></p>

<p>This can be an issue with other characters where their behavior is rather annoying in-universe but you don't want it to be too annoying in the actual book.</p>

Proofreading a novel: when should exclamation marks be used?,"<p>I'm proofreading a novel - the brief has instructed that I do not make any stylistic changes, and correct only the obvious errors that impede sense/clarity.</p>

<p>There are several places where I feel an exclamation mark is missing:</p>

<p>a) ""Good God, I hope not,"" responded Sue.</p>

<p>b) Suddenly, one of the first violinists nudged her companion, and hissed: ""Oh good grief, look over there."" </p>

<p>My feeling is that these are classic examples of exclamatory sentences (Good God! Good grief!) and so it is a basic error to miss the exclamation mark. However, I don't want to interfere with the writer's style if they intend a more laconic tone of voice. I don't think this is the case in (b) at least, due to the use of the word 'hissed', but perhaps I should leave the first example alone, as I don't know for sure what tone of voice isn't intended?</p>

<p>If I write blog about my professional experience which is programming and consulting, how to use third-party materials properly, not infringing copyright?</p>

<li>names of software vendors</li>
<li>names of software products</li>
<li>images, charts and slides from their official presentations</li>
<li>trademark words and terms, e.g. Agile, Scrum</li>

How Do I Define Smells Of A World With Anosmia?,"<p>I am a lifelong writer, who was also born without an ability to smell. I have been trained to engage the reader by applying the five senses, or as many of the five as is practical without becoming excessive. My problem is that I am straight up missing a sense.</p>

<p>Think of a writer who was born blind, and has created stories by dictating them to software or a person. But they're writing characters who aren't blind. How would that person write vision, so that the readers can really feel it?</p>

<p>Or a writer who was born deaf, totally alien to any concept of sound, but none of their characters are hard of hearing.

How to write a compelling village scoundrel?,"<p>I'm trying to flesh out a character in my book that is basically a ""town rowdy"" that takes sport in antagonizing people, especially the main character. At this point I'm having a hard time making him believable in my own mind. I know part of it is just the nature of that person, but I want him to be more than just a convenient source of conflict.

However, its revealed that the patient's wife committed suicide after House made him confess to cheating. The fact that he was cheating didn't turn out to be medically relevant, so the former patient decided to get revenge and put House into pain (to make House feel the pain he felt when his wife died).</p>

<p>What I'm really trying to avoid in my story is the whole ""evil for the sake of being evil"" thing. I'm not trying to make the antagonist look like a good guy, but to make the reader question themselves for just a second and wonder, ""Is the protagonist <em>really</em> doing the right thing?"" or ""Is the antagonist <em>really</em> doing the wrong thing?""

",51331,27-05-2020 08:18,How do you determine whether you know enough to write on a topic?,"<p>I guess that title sounds very abstract and ""meta."" But it points to a real issue that has interfered with my desire to get published and paid as a writer.</p>

<p>For background, I have been a writer in various senses of the term, on and off, for many years. The feedback I've gotten from many quarters suggests that my writing skills are at least good--maybe excellent. But subject matter expertise, that's another thing. I'm interested in--and know a little bit about--a great many things. And occasionally I am pleasantly surprised to find that others consider me an expert on one or another thing, but my own feeling is that I don't have much in-depth knowledge of anything in particular.</p>

<p>But that's okay, because if you're a writer, and you don't know enough about the topic, you do research, right?</p>

<p>However, you need to know when research (or more research) is required. And that's where I seem to have a problem.</p>

<p>About ten years ago--the last time I made a serious attempt to get started as a professional writer--there was an incident that really shook my confidence. I had written a chapter for a web development textbook, and then I got assignments from a well-known online technical journal to report on a couple of open source development projects. My first article was very well-received; the second, not so much. I don't think anyone thought it was a <em>terrible</em> piece, but I heard from readers that it was rather superficial and maybe insufficiently objective. If I remember right, the editor agreed that the article was weak, but didn't consider it a major issue (i.e. he would have been happy at that point to accept more work from me).</p>

<p>The reason I got cold feet after that was not simply that I had made a mistake, but that I felt that it could easily have been prevented--if I had just known that I needed to do more homework. And yet, prior to getting the feedback from readers, I had <em>no clue</em>. There was no little voice inside saying ""wait, are you sure?"" As far as I could tell at the time I submitted it, the unsuccessful article was just as good as the successful one.</p>

<p>What that experience (and some other similar incidents) tells me is that I have a huge blind spot regarding my own understanding of things, which could easily trip me up again any time I try to write on a new topic. And I feel that if I want to get published and keep getting published, I can't afford that.</p>

<p>So: has anyone else encountered this problem? If so, have you learned how to deal with it? Is there a specific method you follow to check your understanding of a topic? Are there any warning signs you have learned to look for?</p>

Is this Plagiarism?,"<p><em>I wrote this blog post about an article I found online -> <a href=""https://www.timesofisrael.com/researchers-develop-system-to-measure-solar-energy-potential-of-city-roofs/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.timesofisrael.com/researchers-develop-system-to-measure-solar-energy-potential-of-city-roofs/</a></em></p>

<p><strong>This is my post:</strong></p>

<p>The orientation of your solar panels is a detrimental factor in how much energy you can produce, depending on where you live. Solar panels are placed on the south side of a roof if they are operating in the northern hemisphere, solar panels in the southern hemisphere will face true north. Also, these solar panels are placed at different angles depending on your latitude. The sun is higher in the sky in cities closer to the equator, so the solar panels are tilted at small angles. Homeowners and businesses have the choice of installing solar trackers, which follows the trajectory of the sun. What if there is a better way of effectively tracking the sun to produce the most amount of electricity? 
Professors Arnon Karnieli and Isaac Meir along with student Arti Tiwari at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev conducted their research to determine the most efficient placement for solar panels in Kiryat Malachi, Israel. The task was difficult, the researchers had to find a way to orient the solar panels on different types of roofs. Karnieli, Meir, and Tiwari approached the challenge by combining an ""orthophoto produced by the Survey of Israel in 2012 (ortho-rectification corrects aerial photos geometrically so that the scale is uniform) and a LiDAR map from 2015 (LiDAR uses laser light and sensors to measure distances) (The Times of Israel)”. The data collected was used to create an aspect slope map, which determined the location and angle for solar panels on each roof in the city. 
LiDAR data for specific locations is very beneficial for solar companies because it provides a better service for customers. Researchers and companies in the solar industry are constantly trying to figure out ways to produce energy. Technologies such as LiDAR are driving the industry towards more conventional solar panels. I recommend reading more about LiDAR’s application in the solar industry and reading the full article by Sue Surkes here.

This often ends up with me writing very weak plot with no direction.</p>

<p>From the site: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are two main types of writers: “discovery writers” and “outliners”.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Discovery writers are kind of like gardeners, growing their story from some seed of an idea and not quite knowing where it will take them.</li>
  <li>Outliners can be thought of as architects, mapping their story out from start to finish before they ever write a single word of prose.</li>
  <li>Gardeners should watch out for “and then I guess it ends” type of endings.</li>
  <li>Architects should watch out for “world builder’s disease”.</li>
  </ul>

Alternatives for the over use of her and she in action scenes,"<p>I am really struggling to try and cut out repetitive use of the word 'her' and 'she' in action scenes while still trying to keep them short and sharp.</p>
<p>I have read other posts here discussing this issue, but I am still not getting it right. When I try to change things to 'show not tell' and eliminate the overused 'her'/'she', I am losing the fast flow needed for action.  Can anyone give me any ideas of alternative ways to cut out the duplicate 'her' 'she'?? Here is a sample of the issue in an action scene: (Thank you!)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Run, don't stop!'</p>
<p>A day ago, she was worried about pregnancy and guitar lessons. Now she was fleeing for her. Life was an unexpected cruel bitch!
Ripping pain in her stomach made her falter; she felt the warmth of blood running down her legs. Abby plunged through the undergrowth. Branches were tearing her skin. She fell and tasted blood; her mouth was filling with it. She heard rustling and lunged to her feet, but could not pinpoint the direction of the sound, gazed wildly about, disorientated. The forest was still, as though waiting to witness an act of cruelty. The sound grew louder, a frenzied rustling like something large was getting dragged through the undergrowth.</p>
<p>Instinctively, Abby knew something terrible was happening. Some old, unspeakable horror slithered over her skin. She was being watched, hunted, smelt, by a predator she could not see; but felt a warning of the presence in every cell of her body.</p>
<p>'This is it. This is the day I die!'</p>
<p>Her eyes fell on a pale shape obscured among the shadows. A swollen face, lips thick, opened. Brown eyes stared from sunken sockets. Lifeless. Half of the neck was missing. The swollen corpse was a girl. Limbs twisted unnaturally, horribly. A sound tore up from deep in Abby's guts, between a scream and a sob. She backed away. Tripped as her foot snared on something cold. She fell face down, dazed, did not need to look up to know what she had tripped on. A portion of the corps that had been separated from the rest of the body? Another corps?</p>
<p>She kept her eyes screwed shut; started crawling along the forest floor, the direction did not matter, just away from the horror she had witnessed.</p>
<p>Could this be real? Maybe the PTSD got the better of her.</p>
<p>Abby opened her eyes and got to her feet, gazed around.
Screamed. Fell to her knees. She tried to call for help, but all that came out was a hoarse terrified whimper.</p>

<p>I'm writing a zombie apocalypse genre book (yes, I know it's a heavily used and abused writing genre, but I'm writing it in my way, a way I believe is a good way). Anyway, I caught myself writing ""he and/or Will"" one too many times in the beginning paragraph. The paragraph solely serves the purpose of making time go by (as the highly contagious zombie virus takes a little time to spread), but also to give the reader a feel of one of the main characters and my writing style. The paragraph is supposed to have a little comedic value through how I write it an through a little vulgar language. Feel free to give feedback on that too. Here it goes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Day 1<br>
  <strong>08:00 AM</strong></p>
  
  <p>""Alright, I’ll pick up Jack from school after work, and then we’ll head to the supermarket"", Mia said as she grabbed the keys to her car.  </p>
  
  <p>""Okay, catch some bad guys then"", Will said as he kissed his wife.</p>
  
  <p>""I will, you worry about doing the bare minimum on your day off"", Mia said taking Jack’s hand.  </p>
  
  <p>""I’ll try. See you later bandit"", Will said hugging his son.  </p>
  
  <p>""See you later dad"", he said grabbing his Spider-Man backpack and heading eagerly out the door.  </p>
  
  <p>Mia followed and waved as she headed out the door.  </p>
  
  <p>Will stood silently in the middle of his simplistic abode, and nodded to himself. <em>What to do?</em> He asked himself dumb-founded as to what he was going to do with the abundance of time he suddenly had on his hands. It wasn’t often he had a day off, and now he did. Will walked into the kitchen and poured some cheerios into a bowl, and covered it in milk, making them float like water doughnuts. He grabbed a spoon and started slurping the the cereal into him whilst walking around his home. Nothing much was going on outside, he thought as he looked out of his window.   </p>
  
  <p>""Wow, I have truly sunk to a new level of purposelessness"", he said catching himself in the act of looking out through the window like an old man.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's more text, but I think the writing is better in that paragraph and utilized less ""he/Wills"" in it. The paragraph isn't supposed to convey much information, rather just a little text to get you started and get the ""action"" started. It's super mundane and boring, but I thought it was need. But then again, I do not know, hence me asking you all. </p>

How to create unique dialogue for characters?,"
So, one of my problems is that I have trouble giving my characters unique voices. They usually all sound the same. <br> I may say that they have a certain dialect or accent, but it doesn't come through in the dialogue. How do I create a unique way of speaking for each of my characters? Basically, how do I add personality to what each character says? 

",51933,20-07-2020 22:30,avoiding making all your characters sound the same,"<p>We surely all have little quirks to our speech. Like my daughter once criticized my writing for using the word ""surely"" too much. (See, I used it on this post.)</p>

<p>So how do you keep all your characters from sounding the same in dialog? That is, how do you keep them all from sounding just like the writer? It's easy to say, ""Pay attention and be careful"", but ... pay attention to what? Okay, in my case I've got my eye out for the word ""surely"". But what else?</p>

<p>There are some obvious extremes. You can make the scientist use a lot of technical language. A 5-year-old should normally talk like a 5-year-old and not like a college professor. In the story I'm working on right now I have a character who lives in another country and who would likely not use English much, so I put some grammar errors into his speech. Etc. Maybe you could give a character some stock phrases that he always uses: ""Elementary, my dear Watson"", ""To the Bat Cave, Robin"", etc. But I'd think there are limits to how far you can go with such things without it sounding too gimicky.</p>

<p>Any tips?</p>

",40268,20-11-2018 18:20,Should I prefer long or short sentences in scientific writing?,"<p>Currently, I am writing papers with rather <strong>short sentences</strong>: About half of them contain around 20 words, about 10% to 20% even less. I am doing this for three reasons: </p>

<ul>
<li>I find short sentences easier to read, </li>
<li>prefer to show relationships using other means, such as colons and conjunctions (e.g. thus, because of, but), </li>
<li>and thought the scientific community agreed upon short sentences being better.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I did some research and came upon <strong>contrary statements</strong>, for instance:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/pgt/COMP60990/lectures/scientific_writing.pdf"">This presentation from the University of Manchester</a> advises that one use short sentences.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.docstyles.com/library/ascience.pdf"">This article about the science of scientific writing</a> prefers long sentences.</li>
<li>The <a href=""http://science.widener.edu/svb/essay/writing.pdf"">ACS Style Guide</a> promotes the happy medium. </li>
</ul>

<p>So: <strong>Should I use long or short sentences, or a mixture, in scientific writing? Why?</strong></p>

Writing a trilogy and editing,"<p>I planned out to write a trilogy and the first draft of book one is now completed. I want to know if I should edit this draft before starting on the second book.</p>
",42196,13-02-2019 14:45,"Do I write the entire series and edit, or edit the books as I go?","<hr>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Woohoo! The time has come, my <em>first book of a trilogy</em> is one chapter away from finishing. I've done a little editing as I go, clearing up the bad chapters, but haven't properly gone through the whole thing or anything.</p>

<p>Firstly, I saw <a href=""https://writers.stackexchange.com/questions/3513/write-to-the-finish-or-edit-as-you-go"">this question</a>, an interesting question, but I'm thinking about not one book... a trilogy. Or a series of any length, really.</p>

<p>So, I was wondering whether I should write the entire series first then edit or write one book, edit that to perfection, then the second one, edit that to perfection, so on and so on. I'm beginning to lean towards writing the entire series, because I'll have the entire thing to work with, but I'm really on the fence right now. I just can't decide, this is an impossibly tricky dilemma.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Question</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should I write my books and edit them one by one. For example, I write the first book, perfect it, write the second book, perfect it, so on and so forth. Or, should I write all the books (without editing them) and then perfect the complete work?</p>

How do you advertise your work if you cover multiple topics or niches?,"<p>Lets assume that you write articles which get published online (on your own website), but these cover a wide range of niches. Some very family friendly, some aimed at children, some horror based, and some erotic (maybe even beyond what you'd call NSFW).</p>

<p>What is the best way to advertise all of your work? I mean, you can't really set up a Twitter account and say ""here's my latest article about a local boy and his dog"", and then say, ""Find out what Lisa did in her latest BDSM session"".</p>

<p>Is there a platform / social network that can be used to showcase all of your work to multiple niches, without having to set up multiple profiles? For example, Pinterest allows one account with multiple boards, whereas Twitter would require multiple user accounts - Are there any similar to Pinterest with the ability to target different audiences?</p>

<p>Any advice?</p>

<p>As an individual, like most of us, I have a wide range of interests, all of which can potentially be turned into a nice little niche blog, or community webzine.</p>

<p>So lets assume I have:</p>

<p>Website 1 : A magazine style website split into 5 sub sections ( music, fasion, horror, alt models, fetish ). Each subsection having it's own Twitter Page, like <code>vice.com</code>.</p>

<p>Website 2 : A personal photography blog featuing my own daily photographs, plus a journal of learning different elements of photography/photoshop. + Twitter Page</p>

<p>Website 3 : A graphic horror website feauting art and photography - Clean &amp; NSFW content. + Twitter Page</p>

<p>So now I have 3 websites, 7 Sections and 7 Twitter Pages, which I will only really want to use for posting details of site updates and answering questions made by readers or followers.</p>

<p>In reality though, I'm running all of these 7 sections as one individual, so it makes sense to me to have a universal Twitter page where I can connect with everyone who I may feature on any number of my sites. This means I don't need to keep logging into multiple accounts to connect with people in different areas, essentially meaning that I can be talking to a band and a photoshop expert at the same time as talking to a fetish model and a horror photographer.</p>

<p>Thing is though, can you successfully build a working relationship with so many different people on the same account. For example, followers who want to talk with me about my involvement in music may be offended by my involvement with NSFW or graphic horror content producers. On the other hand, some people interested in my journey into photography may like to see what I like in fetish or fashion.</p>

<p>I guess this comes down to the fact that social sites like Twitter don't allow you to keep some of your interests hidden from those who they do not apply to. Although this really isn't about hiding or keeping secrets, it's about having the freedom to be yourself, and connect with those you want to work with, without losing contacts based on some areas of your interests. </p>

<p>Do any of you have a broad range of writing topics and use one universal account, or do you split yourself into 2-3 different personas to communicate with different people, at the same time as keeping multiple social pages for your brands (in my case, the 7 website sections)?</p>

Is a nuclear apocalypse cliche?,"<p>My post-apocalyptic novel occurs in 2122.  In canon events, around the year 2018, after many years of global war, a chain reaction caused the launching of all the world's nuclear missiles and after many years of nuclear winter, less than 5% of the world's population has survived.  </p>

<p><strong>These details are never actually mentioned in the book.</strong>  </p>

How to keep romance out of my novel?,"<p>(Kem uses they/them pronouns.)</p>

<p>I'm outlining a story about a witch named Kem who has to protect the world from evil.  Kem befriends demons and other witches, but I don't want them to find a crush or anything and I want to keep their feelings for everyone are platonic or familial.  I want the reader to understand that Kem isn't looking for love, they're just navigating the world of witchcraft and battling baddies.  So how do I show the reader that Kem's relationships are entirely non-romantic, that Kem has no attraction to their friends, and that there will be no romantic sub-plots?  I don't want people to ship Kem with other characters either, so how do I make it absolutely clear Kem is just there for friendship and companionship?    </p>
",42377,20-02-2019 15:31,How do I convey that a relationship is platonic?,"<p>I've been toying around with the idea of writing a novel. The story revolves around two characters, one male and one female, and the perspective will shift between them.  </p>

<p>One of the central ideas of the story is that the two characters couldn't be any more different. They have different sets of talents, different world views, different ways of handling crises. Yet despite all that sets them apart, they're the best of friends. Nobody, including the two of them, can quite put into words <em>why</em> their friendship works as well as it does, but they're nonetheless inseparable.  </p>

<p>Here's the catch: This is <em>not</em> a love story. Both consider the other a close friend, but nothing more. It's not something they've ever considered, and their relationship won't ever become anything more than what it is. Unfortunately, every introduction for the two of them that I've come up with invariably feels like a cliched setup for a cheesy romance.  </p>

<p>I could directly call out the fact that they don't view each other in a romantic light, but that feels sloppy, and doesn't resonate very well. I'd rather show that they're just friends, rather than resort to directly summarizing how they feel about each other. I also don't want to introduce a different love interest for either one of them. In their eyes, they have each other, and that's about it.  </p>

<p>What's the best way for me to introduce their relationship, and not overtly hint at a future romance?</p>

Should I join writers organizations?,"<p>There are several professional writers organizations that people I know have suggested I join.  The problem is they're rather pricey and I'm not sure what I'll get out of it.  </p>

<p>Much of what they have are multiple services for writers who have completed manuscripts looking to shop them, and for writers with published books looking to help market them (some self-published, some traditionally published).  In these cases it of course makes sense to wait until I'm in that category.  </p>

<p>But they also have critique groups, online help, seminars, and other programs aimed at people (published already or not) who are in the creation stages of a new work.</p>

(*Its just my plan, I don't know yet how will it work out in reality). I have finished 80 pages which is the complete rough draft of my book. My ending is reached, now I am just going to fill in the blanks with major plots. Its still a meaningful writing.</p>

<p>How should I design length of a chapter. If I decide that each chapter should be around 20 pages then the story gets broken and shifted to next chapter.

And that's what WORKS. When I try to write something long I end up getting terrible writer's block and can't write for days or more--because if I do write then I all but mess up the story. And because I'm not writing on it I sort of lose interest and when I come back to it I just get confused. It's like I can't handle anything complicated. I try mapping out the story and characters like people suggest, but that seems to just...mess with my mind and make it worse. </p>

<p>So sometimes I start over. Like with ""Annabel's Demon""--I've tried three different times to write it, and each time end up at a standstill. I tried writing in third, then first, then third again. Tweaked the story and characters. Completely started over. And found myself failing to write anything decent. I get lost. I stop and try to go back. I leave it for a while and write something else. Once, when I was a preteen, I managed to write a good 80 pages of a story, but never finished. And now when I go back to it I realise it just needs rewritten and...it isn't a good enough story for that much work.</p>

<p>Are there a tried and true techniques to do this?</p>
",47894,08-09-2019 21:26,Formatting multiple languages while avoiding italics for native speakers in their POV,"<p>Looking at <a href=""https://writers.stackexchange.com/questions/1742/whats-the-best-way-to-show-a-foreign-language-in-a-manuscript"">this question</a>, I was trying to figure out how to format a small family of novels and short stories that use a number of languages. My original approach went with the above question's style. However, over the last few years, I've been to a number of panels about multiple languages and had conversations where many native speakers feel that setting off foreign words in italics came off as jarring when they are usually smoothly integrated into their speech. Given that, they recommend that foreign words were not italicized.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""No,"" said Chimípu, ""I don't think so. When we were fighting, she used the <em>tazágu</em> and I didn't see any knives. Whoever killed Karawàbi used a straight blade; the wound is too clean and deep.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using the above example, the POV character (Rutejìmo) is a native speaker of the language, so tazágu wouldn't be italicized.</p>

<p>Which seemed like a reasonable thing until I hit the bilingual character who initially doesn't know the foreign words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Her mother raised an eyebrow and looked at the chest. ""You had a <em>sands damned</em> bag you packed yesterday. It was small and light, <em>worthy</em> of travel. What is that <em>fupujyu chìdo</em>? Are you taking that instead?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this case, ""fupujyu chìdo"" would fine italicized or not, it is jarring since the main character (Kanéko) doesn't know the words but the untranslated word could be either.</p>

<p>However... <em>sands damned</em> is notionally translated (translated into English since the POV character knows the word). I wanted to demonstrate her mother alternates frequently between two languages (and swears up a storm but that's the basis for her magic). Later in her series, she gets fluent between two languages (much like her mother) so there is a lot more notionally translated phrases and entire sentences.</p>

<p>To add special complexity, I'm planning on combining these two novels together (well and all the other stories) into a single book to a master plot across multiple novels. That means native speakers (which I think would be better not italicized to keep them in harmony), with unknown words, and notionally translated at the same time. Plus, there are nine or so other languages across the combined novels though never more than three in a given chapter (because it gets annoying).</p>

<p>I thought about translating it after the phrase, but there is a lot of speaking in these novels and there some characters who bounce between two languages constantly (mainly because I grew up with a polyglot household so that was the norm for me).</p>

<p>So, does the attempt to not italicize for native speakers make sense? Would have it not italicized for native points of view but italicized for non-native be reasonable?</p>

<p>Would indicating the native language in the chapter headers for the combined one solve the problem? I could do the same at the beginning of the book.</p>

<p>I'm not sure about the triple language chapters though. Originally I thought of using three separate fonts but I wasn't sure if that made sense. In the first version, I used serif for native, italicized serif for the second, and sans serif for the third language.</p>

First or third person,"<p>I'm sitting with a bit of a dilemma.
I'm writing a novel and I'm struggling with the decision of whether I should use first or third person. 
I prefer third person, also prefer to read novels written in third person, but this specific novel centres around a woman finding herself trapped in a world where she's the only survivor and the challenges that she has to face because of it. 
If I write it in third person it suggests that someone else survived to tell the tale.
I need to create the feeling of utter loneliness.</p>

How do I know if my cast is diverse enough or too diverse?,"<p>Basically, I am writing a story and I want to know if the characters are diverse enough or too diverse. If I just state the characters' races, sexualities, etc, it might seem forced but I didn't really focus on it much, they just are that way. A lot of the characters come from different places, so there isn't really one place for me to google the demographics of, but they are mostly from various states in the US and an island that I made up. I'm not going to say my characters specifically because I would like more general advice for other future stories as well. I'm mostly worried about my story not being diverse enough, because, it is possible for something to be too diverse, but I figure as long as most of the cast isn't the same thing, it'll be alright. And a lot of people are underrepresented, so I'm more focused on that.</p>

<p>Most of my characters are some form of lgbt+, but I'm not very worried about that because most stories are pretty much all straight so it wouldn't be a big deal. it's not like I stop every 2 pages to mention it. And I made sure to make them a mix of different sexualities. i tend to just automatically make everyone bi or something but im working on it</p>

<p>I'm sorry if this explanation was too long! But I would really appreciate answers for this because I couldn't find much about this. Or if you could mention websites that talk about this, that would be great too! So yeah. (:</p>
",48294,01-10-2019 01:20,"Is my story ""too diverse""?","<p>(Edit: I feel like I should clarify, these are the only LGBT characters in the story, and the only characters whose sexualities are even touched on, and they are part of a larger group of people, about 300.  This story occurs in America near a large city, so the racial makeup of this group is very mixed.) </p>

<p>(I've asked quite a few other questions about this story, lol.)</p>

<p>In my post-apocalyptic story, my MC, Eris, is Latina and queer, and her love interest, Caspian, is bisexual and adopted by a black lesbian named Ezrith (who was in love with his biological mother).  Caspian is romantically interested in Leo, a Latino gay man who is in a relationship with Alexander, an Asian gay transgender man.  This is my main cast, and they're pretty much a mixed bag of everything you could imagine.</p>

<p>I've written them to be as diverse as possible without forcing it.  For example, I don't focus on the fact that Leo isn't white; I simply state in passing that he has dark skin and a lilting accent.  I don't explicitly state that Caspian isn't straight, it's just to be inferred through his behavior around attractive male and female characters.  I don't have neon signs screaming, ""Ezrith is lesbian,"" I just have Caspian explain to Eris that Ezrith was in love with his biological mom.  </p>

<p>I know minority representation is a good thing, and I'm not white or straight so I usually make an effort to incorporate minorities into my writing that aren't stereotypical.  But is there such a thing as having a story that is ""too diverse""?  Is it unrealistic to have such a diverse cast of characters?  Is it alienating to readers who are white and straight to be put into the shoes of someone who is drastically dissimilar to them?    </p>

Making 2 characters fall on love,"<p>So I’ve been working on this story for almost 3 years now but I always start over because  my ideas change over time . This time tho , the protagonists changed a lot from the original idea . So here’s the problem . 
The female is more of a crazy type , she’s a drug addict and she’s the typical maniac character that can throw a knife into someone’s head out of boredom . 
And the male ...he has some trust issues and frustrations . He hates being controlled and hates being “like a loser” to say . 
The issue is that the female will be a bitch to him , it’s just the way she is . Playing mind games , cursing him , making rude remarks .. 
Because of that he’ll just give up of trying to befriend her “screw it” . Idk how good i explained . You get the idea , their personalities are stopping them from being together. 
He will get angry cause she treats him like trash , and she? She’s bored .

In the school every other child is from a much higher class society and family. So the boy is most likely to be bullied and that turned out to be true. </p>

<p>There is also a girl character who is super popular in that school. I want my main character and this girl character to fall in love with each other, but not finding a reasonable way to tie most popular girl to the most bullied boy ever. ALSO, the girl character is not the motherly type creature in general. So I can't make her fall in love with him out of kindness and generosity. No, the girl character is not mean. I meant she isn't that kind of girl who will notice a bullied person and necessarily feel like helping him. Also I don't want her to be in Love with him out of sympathy, that would be pathetic. She is actually a trouble maker kind of girl but she is also very playful, funny and childish. </p>

"If a story includes a cross country road trip, do the highway and city names need to be real?","<p>If a story includes a cross country road trip set in the USA in 1970’s, do the highway and city names need to be accurate / real? If she takes a train cross-country, do the routes need to also be real?</p>
",52146,07-08-2020 17:49,Is it Ok to make up places if I want the reader to think it’s set in the real world?,"<p>What I’m doing is making a story in the medieval times and I wanted to make up a village and have my characters be there and travel around there but do I have to make everything around there in the book like how it was in real life? For example if my character where to travel south, in real life he would reach Berwick castle but in the book I don’t want anything to be there. It’s important to me that it’s set in the real world because the second book is supposed to be in Wisconsin so I don’t want to switch from not real to real. (Sorry if I’m confusing)</p>
