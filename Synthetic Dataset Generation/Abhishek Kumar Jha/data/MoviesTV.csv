Movie bullet magic,"<p>For several decades I've observed in westerns that during gun fight scenes, it appears that someone out of frame is firing frangible projectiles (chalk?) very close to the actors.

If this was the case, he had successfully altered the future and the crash should not have happened in the future. If the crash itself had not taken place, how did he send the engine?

What's the logic behind the fake/real computer chip?,"<p>So in Now You See Me 2, after the Horsemen steal the computer chip that Walter Mabry wanted, Daniel goes to the market to try to hand over the chip to someone from the Eye, but it turns out he was tricked by Walter. He's cornered and ordered to give it up, but Dylan cuts in and saves him.</p>

<p>Dylan gets beaten up and half-drowned, but the Horsemen save him. Right then, Jack says the chip is a fake. Then there's a whole scene where they're discussing what to do and how they could suddenly have a fake chip, and how they lost the real one. </p>

<p>But later, on the plane, Daniel is coerced into giving Walter the chip, which turns out to be real again. So was it real the whole time? Or was it switched with a fake, and right up till the end, the Horsemen were still pretending it was real? And if so, where did the real one go?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jack: Wait something is not right.</p>
  
  <p>Atlas: What's wrong?</p>
  
  <p>Jack: It's fake.</p>

<p>Then they assumed that Walter did not know that the chip is fake. So they came with a plan to bluff. They pretended that they had the real chip. After they got caught by Walter, they gave the fake chip to Walter. Walter checked the chip and declared it as real. The Four Horsemen were surprised.</p>

  <p>Thirty years into the future in 2074, time travel is invented, but is

How does killing Barron affect the timeline in Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children?,"<p>In the movie ""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children"", Mr. Barron kidnaps Miss Peregrine in order to use her in his immortality experiment.  With Miss Peregrine gone, the time loop she created in September 1943 collapses, stranding Jake and the other kids in 1943.  So to rescue Miss Peregrine, they take a ship to Blackpool, where Miss Avicet's loop in January 2016 is located.  While aboard the ship, Emma says this to Jake:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jake, you know what this means don't you? ... We have to get to our own time but you don't.  You can continue to live in 2016... If we kill Barron, he'll be gone but time will carry on.  He won't go to Florida, Abe won't die, and you can go home.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is, how would killing Barron save the life of Jake's grandfather Abe?  Abe died in July 2016, so theoretically killing a version of Barron from before then would prevent Abe's death.  But that's not what happens; in Blackpool Barron speaks about Abe's death:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I tracked Abe Portman for months.  All I needed was a few minutes to get the location of Miss Peregrine's loop from him.  But no, Mathus couldn't wait.  And instead, I had to masquerade as a psychiatrist for three weeks in Florida.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if Barron has already participated in the Florida events, how will killing Bareon mean that ""he won't go to Florida [and] Abe won't die""?</p>

Then as the episode goes on it's shown that it's a real, physical place, with artificially intelligent robots.

Later during the events of <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1201607/"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Part 2</em></a> we (and Harry) take a look at the late Prof. Snape's memories and see that it was actually Snape who cast a doe Patronus (supposedly to Harry's aid), much to Dumbledore's surprise, who therefrom deduces a relation to Lily Potter (who Snape was secretly in love with all the years, albeit only unilaterally):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Dumbledore:</strong> Lily, after all this time?<br>
  <strong>Snape:</strong> Always.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which already makes me wonder what Dumbledore was actually surprised about there. Was he simply surprised that Snape still loved Lily or was there anything deeper suggested with this Patronus? Add to this that Harry was a bit confused, too, and asked Dumbledore (or at least his mind-image of him, however you take that scene) about the reason for the related Patronuses, which didn't clear any confusions for me, though:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Harry:</strong> Professor, my mother's patronus was a doe, wasn't it? That's the same as professor Snape's. That's curious, don't you think?<br>
  <strong>Dumbledore:</strong> Actually, if I think about it, it doesn't seem curious at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So my first question would be, <strong>is there any deeper reason why Prof. Snape and Lily Potter both have a doe as Patronus</strong> or is it just to express that they've always been what one would call soulmates? And <strong>why did the Patronus appear in the Forest of Dean at that moment?</strong> Snape's discussion with Dumbledore and his casting of the Patronus occurred way earlier than that (as Dumbledore obviously was still alive, so at maximum during the events of the <em>Half-Blood Prince</em>). If that was implied to have been the same Patronus that appeared at the Forest of Dean (as the montage implies), why/how/where did it wait for so long? Is this just one of those various moments of stuff ""magically"" appearing when needed (as the Gryffindor Sword and the Room of Requirements use to do) or is there a more elaborate reason the movie just didn't delve into (or am I just too stupid to get it)?</p>

Why are movies still shot on film?,"<p>Many modern big budget films such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Force_Awakens"">Star Wars: The Force Awakens</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)"">Interstellar</a> and even some TV shows such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad"">Breaking Bad</a> are still shot on film.</p>

<p>Directors such as Christopher Nolan and Quentin Tarantino have stated that they oppose digital cinematography due to the inferior image quality. Tarantino even saying that he thinks digital cinema is the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BON9Ksn1PqI"">""death rattle""</a> of the film industry.</p>

<p>What are the benefits of shooting on film? Pre-2010 it seems film may have had a technical edge, but with the advancing technology I cannot see any way in which film is still superior:</p>

<p>Modern digital cameras are smaller, lighter, cheaper, more flexible and offer a much higher dynamic range, frame rate and a similar or better resolution than their film counterparts. In addition, most films are edited and projected digitally at 2K or 4K which would remove any additional resolution you may gain from film. Even if a ""film look"" is desired it can be created in post production from digital footage and can look indistinguishable from real film.</p>

<p>Why do many directors and cinematographers still prefer film? I cannot find anything other than vague mentions of ""better resolution"" or ""it just looks better"".</p>

Were Doc's calculations incorrect as to when Marty should drive the DeLorean?,"<p>In the original <em>Back to the Future</em> when Marty is trying to get back to 1985, Doc puts an alarm clock on the dashboard of the DeLorean and tells Marty:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I've calculated the distance and wind resistance retroactive from the moment the lightning strikes. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Moments before the alarm goes off, the DeLorean's engine stops and Marty struggles to get it to start again. While he struggles with it the alarm clock rings. When the engine eventually starts Marty then starts to drive the car and he is successful to travelling back to 1985. Because he started a few seconds late due to the engine trouble, were the Doc's calculations incorrect by a few seconds?</p>
",70409,20-03-2017 19:13,"In Back to the Future, how did Marty get the timing right with the lightning strike?","<p>So, in the first movie, presumably the Doc and Marty know exactly when the lightning will strike the clock tower. This is because Marty has the flyer with the picture of the stopped clock on it. In order to power the DeLorean, the Doc cooks up this contraption to conduct the lightning through a hook into the DeLorean. All Marty has to do is be driving at 88 mph and hit the wire at the exact right moment.</p>

<p>Here's the question though - if you recall, the Doc sets a timer and tells Marty to drive back to a pre-designated starting point. When the timer goes off, Marty is supposed to accelerate to 88 mph. My assumption is that the Doc has calculated the maximum acceleration of the DeLorean, and using this value has determined the exact starting point that the car needs to be at in order to hit the lightning at the right time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the car stalls. It takes Marty a while, but he's finally able to start it up. Being that he started late though...shouldn't he have missed the lighting?</p>

Speaking different languages in Ghost in the Shell,"<p>Just watched <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1219827/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ghost in the Shell</a>, a movie inspired by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">its Anime counterpart</a>, and occurring in Hong Kong. Being a movie on a non-english country, usually one of two things happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Movie is (almost) entirely in english</li>
<li>Movie is entirely in foreign language</li>
</ul>
<p>With american actors, the first option was the obvious go-to. In these cases, it is frequent to show the characters starting to speak the foreign language (just for a couple of sentences), and then switch to English. <strong>The idea is to convey to the user that they are speaking another language but that it is understandable to the characters, just like English is to the viewers.</strong></p>
<p>In fact, sometimes the opposite is done, where characters speak foreign languages without subtitles to give the viewer the sensation of hostility or confusion (see <a href=""http://madmax.wikia.com/wiki/The_Buzzards"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mad Max</a> or <a href=""https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/arrival-chinese-line-ending"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Arrival</a>).</p>

<p>It doesn't seem that they are both speaking the same foreign language. The Asian actor is the only one speaking constantly in Chinese. Subtitles appear on his lines, so the viewer is meant to understand them, just like the characters.</p>
<h2>Is the language used meant to be literally interpreted (e.g., they are actually speaking English and Chinese to each other)? Or is there some perspective being conveyed to the viewers?</h2>
<p>In the former, why would the <em>Public Security Section 9</em> speak English most of the time? In the latter, why this approach with only specific characters speaking the foreign language?</p>

",71518,10-04-2017 17:29,Why do soap operas have the soap opera effect?,"<p>The <em>soap opera effect</em> occurs when frame interpolation is used. For example, if a movie is shot at 24 frames per second and then shown on a TV screen which is capable of displaying 60 frames per second then it is possible to use a computer to do motion interpolation. In other words the computer can average (interpolate) two frames and create a synthetic third frame and stick it between the two real frames.</p>

<p>This interpolation makes the picture look unnatural and plastic, somewhat like soap operas look on TV, hence the name.</p>

Unbeknownst to them, she actually carries it with her.</p>
<p>In one of the final scenes, a bare footed Rose walks to the railing of the search ship, climbs up on it in similar fashion to when she and Jack were on the prow of the Titanic, and throws it into the ocean.</p>
<p>The accepted answer in <a href=""https://movies.stackexchange.com/q/1985/566"">Why did Lovett invite Rose aboard his search boat in Titanic?</a> suggests Rose threw it overboard for 'closure', but I simply cannot understand how that was closure.  After all, it is not as though Jack (when alive) had any real interest in it.  Nor did Rose. It was of interest only to her fiance Cal (who took his own life in 1929, when the stock market crashed).</p>
<p>It could be said that the return of the 'Heart of the <em>Ocean</em>' to the ocean, was ..poetic in a sense, but how was it closure?  If not closure, then why did she do it?</p>
<h2>Update</h2>
<p>Interestingly, the <a href=""http://www.pages.drexel.edu/%7Eina22/splaylib/Screenplay-Titanic.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">original script</a> differs from the movie in that the people searching for the diamond are there to <em>witness</em> her throwing it overboard.  She even has a few words with Lovett as he is holding the object of his desire in his hand.</p>

Children actors in R-Rated films,"<p>When a children appear in a movie that has a scene or two depicting sexuality (R rated material), is it the norm to let these children know what kind of movie they are participating in? Or are they kept in the dark until they grow up and find out?</p>

"How to explain this apparent paradox in ""Arrival""?","<p>(Here be spoilers)  </p>

<p>Crucial events in the plot of ""Arrival"" involve:</p>

<ul>
<li>Main character Louise learning from the Chinese General his wife's last words, as well as his phone number (that apparently never changes) ; along a vision she gets of a reception subsequent to the Heptapods visit  </li>
<li>Louise using this phone number to call the General, and remind him of his wife's last words in order to trigger him to stop using violence towards the Heptapod visitors, during their visit to Humanity.  </li>
</ul>

<p>According to the General's comments during the reception (something like ""I don't understand how your mind works""), it seems that he has not mastered the Heptapod language, and only has a linear perception of time.
From his point of view, it seems that the reason he mentions his wife's words during the reception, is because he remembers the phone call Louise made him years ago.
And a reason why Louise can tell him those words during their phone call, is because she learnt them from that discussion.
This seems like a ""circular"" paradox to me: the depiction of a universe and timeline where event #1 causes event #2, and where event #2 causes event #1.
Also, the easiness with which the General discloses such a personal information does not feel consistent with the character.  </p>

<p>I was very happy to watch a movie depicting a somewhat rigorous scientific approach to communication attempts with visiting members of a new species; and am not reluctant to discontinuing my disbelief regarding the perception skill that mastering the Heptapod language brings, given how convincingly this feature is presented during the movie.
However I feel dissatisfied with what I perceive as a violation of the rule of causality, introduced without any other justifications, and that looks like an artificial way of generating more ""buzz"" and discussion around the movie - while it already has more than enough good material to inspire those.   </p>

<p>Is this paradox present in the original novel? Is there an explanation that makes it more consistent with the overall rigorous tone of the story?</p>

<p>For the immutable time theory to work, i.e. Louise to be unaware of her calling him, she shouldn't have that information which after the events of the movie she does. </p>

<p>Does this suggest a multiple timeline theory? That would support heptapods trying to change their fate by transcending humans and asking for their help. But at the same time it challenges their ability to be able to perceive the future, as there would be infinite possibilities and also they would have choice to change their fate which the movie plot goes against.</p>

However, <em><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Black Swan</a></em> is classified as a Drama/Thriller movie (and at least one pundit has said that it was  <a href=""http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Black-Swan-Greatest-Trick-Was-Convincing-Oscar-It-Isn-t-Horror-23334.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">really a horror film</a> that only got an Oscar because it was able to not be associated with the frequently award-snubbed horror genre). Then there are some movies like <em><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1540011/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Blair Witch</a></em> that are both Horror and Thriller.</p>

<p>What exactly is the difference between these two genres? What would cause a movie to be a horror movie, but not a thriller (and vice versa), and what would cause them to be both?</p>

<p>(I imagine that there are film scholars and such who have weighed in on this, and I'd like to see something more authoritative like that instead of just the average Joe's opinions).</p>

Is 70mm really necessary? Wouldn't it work with 35mm too?,"<p>So I just came back from Dunkirk, seen in IMAX, 70mm version.</p>

<p>I was digging around the internet with my question but only found religious answers (it's just better, can't describe it, you must see it), rather than technical.</p>

<p>So I just considered these statements, which are hopefully correct:</p>

<ul>
<li>IMAX is screening films in 2K resolution</li>
<li>According to IMAX, 35mm film has a digital equivalent of 6000 lines of horizontal resolution (6K), while 70mm film has the equivalent of 18,000 lines of digital resolution (more like 12,000 in reality).</li>
</ul>

<p>=> 35mm seems to be more than enough for IMAX screen, why 70mm then?</p>

<p>I'm familiar with the DSLR world. Full frame cameras are better than APS-C, because the sensor captures more light, the camera performs better especially in bad lighting conditions. So for example you don't have to use so high ISO and have less noise and stuff like that. I did some simple tests (nothing exact, just going out with both FX and APS-C camera) and I would say that with good lighting (like on a sunny day), the difference in output photos is almost non-existent. </p>

<p>Back to my question. My thoughts are that:</p>

<ol>
<li>70mm is more about being commercially interesting.</li>
<li>The main difference in IMAX is the aspect ratio</li>
<li>Probably it gives the director (cameraman) some more space on what to do as the sensor is bigger and therefore captures more light. Some shots would probably look worst on 35mm.</li>
</ol>

<p>Still not sure about: If they did shoot it on 35mm (even crop it to keep the IMAX aspect ratio), then screen it in IMAX on the same screen, would it look that much different?</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> The question <a href=""https://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/45424/what-exactly-is-70mm-print-and-why-does-anyone-care"">What exactly is 70mm print and why does anyone care?</a> is different. It just asks what 70mm is. My question is more about whether 70mm makes any difference in comparison to 35mm given screen sizes and the fact that 35mm is already more than enough to capture resolutions needed for big screens such as IMAX.</p>
",78411,06-08-2017 23:54,What exactly is 70mm print and why does anyone care?,"<p>There has been a bit of controversy lately over the release of Tarantino's <em>Hateful Eight</em> movie.

Disney chose to push/force/coerce/convince/whatever this theater into showing <em>The Force Awakens</em> instead.</p>

<p>This has caused a rather large uproar from both Tarantino, as well as many of his fans.</p>

<p>I will be honest, before I read this story I had never heard the term ""70mm"" before in my life; I only last week learned that there is a theater in my area that screens 70mm prints. Now I'm wondering what the big deal is, how these are any different from the versions shown at my usual theater, and why this format seems to have suddenly, out of nowhere (at least from my perspective) become a big deal.</p>

How are difficult/disturbing scenes involving children dealt with during film making?,"<p>I always wondered about scenes in movies or tv shows that show a child dealing with some sort of a disturbing, gruesome or difficult situation. I'm talking about how the child actors are dealt with and how the hard scenes they have to act in are explained to them.</p>

<p>For example, in some movies (mostly horror/thriller genre) we see a child as a antagonist: a villain with a twisted mind, a killer or abuser. Some of this type of movies are really disturbing and hardcore, with explicit content (blood, vulgar language etc.).
Or movies where said child's parents are killed, the child is abused/beaten/assaulted in any other way.</p>

<p>How is it explained to child actors that this is just ""pretend""? Of course this applies to really young actors, I guess that teenagers or 9/10 year olds are fully aware that the movie is just a movie and it's not real. Same goes for little, little kids like infants - they probably don't even know what's really happening.</p>

<p>Is there some sort of a psychologist or counselor involved in the movie that talks to the child actors and helps them go through the often really though content they have to act through?</p>

<p>Or maybe those scenes are shot or edited in a specific way that the child actor is not really involved in a difficult scene but it is then edited and added to the final piece in post-production.</p>
",66572,10-01-2017 08:04,To what extent are child actors exposed to the violent aspects of the movie they perform in?,"<p>Some movies feature child characters put in violent situations. This can range from crude language to extreme horror (e.g. torture, gore, etc.). As an example, <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094862/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Child's Play</a> and its sequel has plenty of those scenes. It looks like a paradox that children can be actors in movies that are definitely <em>not</em> for children.</p>

<p>Do the directors usually try and avoid exposing the very young actors to the violence of such scenes, e.g. by clever dubbing and editing? Are there laws that require them to do so, just like there are ratings that prevent children from seeing some movies?</p>

"In the opening credits of a TV show, why do some people get an ""and"" before their name?","<p>In the opening credits of a TV show, I have seen that sometimes on the last actor/actress, they will get an ""and"" before their name. An example that comes to mind is on It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, Frank is credited with ""and Danny DeVito"". Why do they do that, what is the purpose of it? What determines if a cast member is worthy of the ""and""? I know there is <a href=""https://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/1551/in-opening-credits-for-tv-shows-why-does-it-say-with-so-and-so-for-some-actor"">this</a> question about ""with""; do the same rules apply for ""and""?</p>
",66045,02-01-2017 08:29,What rules govern how TV show opening credits are structured?,"<p>I've always been curious what decides if a credit is in the opening or closing credits.  It seems loosely that cast (in order of today's ""big name"" significance), directors and financiers get the front spots, and everything else appears later.  But lately I've been developing some specific curiosities about how cast members are credited on TV shows.</p>

<p>Opening credits seem to follow this rough outline:</p>

<p>Part of ""opening credits"" video segment</p>

<ol>
<li>(optional) Major Actors</li>
<li>Show Title</li>
<li>Core Cast Actors</li>
<li>Directors</li>
<li>Producers</li>
<li>(optional) Episode Title</li>
<li>Episode Writers</li>
</ol>

<p>Subtitles over beginning of show, after opening video</p>

<ol>
<li>(Episode Title and Writers may appear here, instead)</li>
<li>Special Guest Actors</li>
</ol>

<p>I've probably missed a few things, and mis-ordered a few things.  But, as I said, my main curiosity is about actor credits.</p>

<p>Typically, there is little indication of which characters the core cast actors play.  Sometimes their name is edited to appear along with an image of the character as an indictator, but sometimes there is no indication.  As I've never seen anyone credited in both the opening and closing credits, that leaves the potential for core actors to never be directly associated with their character.  This seems potentially problematic; is there a reason for this?  Are viewers expected to know who's who?</p>

<p>Guest actors sometimes are simply credited by name (and not being part of the opening video, this means they will never be associated with their character in credits).  But often they are credited as ""<strong>special guest</strong> as <strong>character name</strong>"".  This is quite helpful.</p>

<p>The thing I find really confusing is, sometimes the last few regular cast actors will get the guest actor treatment.  I've seen opening video with ""and <strong>actor</strong> as <strong>character</strong>"" paired with an image of that character for an entire season.  Why does this actor get special treatment?</p>

<p>Finally, sometimes guest actors will be credited at the front following the opening video, sometimes they'll be credited in the closing credits.  Are there rules for deciding who get's credited early or late?</p>

<p>I've sometimes wondered if shows deliberately play with actor's name position to obfuscate plot arcs (""you won't think we're killing of this character if their actor is still in the opening credits"", or ""you won't expect this recurring guest if we place their name in the closing credits"") and I've also wondered if there are thresholds for ""people appearing in XX number or YY percentage of episodes get placed <strong>here</strong>.""  But it's difficult to build a good sampling base for this.  And season 7 of Stargate SG-1 kinda took a shotgun to my guesses so far.</p>

<p>So...  Are there rules?</p>

How is it that no one knows who Arnold is?,"<p>We found out later in the season that Bernard is made in the image of Arnold. Also in earlier episodes, Bernard himself asks Ford about Arnold. How is it possible that no one in the whole park knows who Arnold is, and what he looked like?</p>

<p>I can understand that it has been many years(30?) since the park opened and new people might not know about the 2nd partner, especially since Delos will not want anyone to know about someone so important committing suicide just before opening of the park. But Elsie points out in one episode that Bernard 'has been there since ever'. I am not sure if it was mentioned or I forgot when Ford introduced Bernard in the park, but it seems a little improbable that no one even back then knew about Arnold. Also Bernard being a programmer himself could easily see at any point the code commits made by Arnold. Maybe it was one of those 'it doesn't look like anything to me' thing, maybe.</p>

<p>But the massacre at the church location must have been a huge thing, even if Delos hushed it up. Someone must know, right? Speaking of Delos, someone in higher management must have known about Arnold(William's father-in-law?). </p>

<p>On a sidenote, isn't it too cocky and careless of Ford to keep a photo of him(at a very young age) with a guy looking like Bernard in his office. Ok, so Bernard probably wont even see Arnold in that photo, but he can't be the only one visiting his office. Ford seems to spend an awful lot of time at his other underground office anyways.</p>

If Bernard never rotates out of the facility, why has no-one noticed he doesn't ever leave? the picture of Ford, his father and Bernard would indicate that the Bernard/Arnold host has been knocking around the facility for a long time (The flashback of Ford activating the machine looks like a much younger Ford, I'd speculate 20 years younger minimum).

<li><p>When Daenerys' dragons were born in the season 1 finale, ""Fire and Blood"" (<em>Game of Thrones</em>, S01E10)</p></li>
<li><p>Killing the khals by locking them inside the temple of Vaes Dothrak and lighting the place on fire in ""Book of the Stranger"" (<em>Game of Thrones</em>, S06E04) - while all the men burned alive, Daenerys emerged from the hut unscratched.</p></li>
<li><p>The steaming hot bath in ""Winter is Coming"" (<em>Game of Thrones</em>, S01E01) - Daenerys is warned by a servant that ""it's too hot, my lady"", but she steps in without flinching</p></li>
<li><p>Daenerys casually picks up the dragon eggs that were roasting on hot coals, in ""A Golden Crown"" (<em>Game of Thrones</em>, S01E06) - when the Dothraki handmaiden, Irri, rushes in and knocks them off her hands, Daenery's hands are unscathed, while Irri's now have burn marks</p></li>
</ol>

Why didn't Norrington try to save himself?,"<p>In Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, Liz Swann was taken captive along with her crew members after being made Captain and a Pirate Lord by a dying Sao Feng. A redeemed James Norrington is among those who imprisoned her, but after some soul-searching, he releases them.</p>

<p>Liz is about to escape when Bootstrap Bill tries to stop them. And Norrington says something about 'their destinies have been entwined, but never joined' and faces Bootstrap. Rather than let Liz be re-captured, he shoots the rope she's hanging from, drops her in the sea and gets himself skewered.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>He had both his sword and his gun out, and pointing at Bootstrap, but he uses the gun on the rope, and the sword, not at all. He could have just shot Bootstrap, pulled himself onto the rope, then used the sword to cut it. Even if he didn't want to hurt Bootstrap, he could've shot him in the leg or something.</p>

From how Bootstrap was acting, it didn't seem likely he'd have jumped off after them, or had the presence of mind to grab the rope (in which case, just cut it again). And it couldn't be that he couldn't reach the rope: Liz just hopped up and grabbed it, and she's a lot shorter than him.</p>

It tears Georgie's arm off, It slashes the chubby kid's gut, and in the final scene It throws one of them against the wall. According to the news clippings It took down a camp of ninety adults single handed. It seems to be pretty good at luring the kids away from the group and also has apparently unfettered access to their homes. I can appreciate that It 'feeds on their fear' so It ideally wants to keep them alive for optimal feeding but once It has identified them as threats why wouldn't It just isolate and quickly kill them Itself (rather than make a half-baked attempt to get the school bully to do it). Even in the final battle scene when it's quite obvious that these kids are a threat, It continues to resort to scare tactics rather than slice and dice.

After leaving Gray Matter, why didn't he continue his research, or decide to start his own business, as he was a genius chemist that anyone has ever seen?</p>

<p>Becoming a school teacher doesn't suit his type and was a waste of his talent. Starting from the very first episode we see that he is poor (before his cancer is diagnosed). Why didn't he think about his family before, leaving them with money etc.?</p>

I am not familiar with the job market for chemists but it seems that he obviously has better job opportunities (e.g. chemistry professor at any university, research scientist, work at a pharmaceutical lab). The pay is paltry and he doesn't seem to take great pleasure out of teaching high school kids. So why does he teach at a high school?</p>

He'd still have to carry around a secret that he didn't actually graduate from Harvard Law, but that's far better than practicing law illegally.  And even though he's already been practicing law without a license, if he became a real lawyer, then only his past cases would be tainted (and possibly need to be revisited) and not all of his future ones.</p>

<p>How do the casters advertise these positions? Do they actually say they are looking for a person ugly enough to be the butt of a joke about their appearance?</p>
",86046,27-02-2018 19:21,How do filmmakers avoid offending actors when casting?,"<p>Almost all characters in films necessitate actors who have certain features before makeup and costumes fill in the gaps. The role of James Bond, for instance, necessarily calls for a tall, handsome and athletic actor.</p>

<p>How do filmmakers avoid offending actors when they cast them (or seek to cast them) in a role where the character requires certain traits which may be considered undesirable, such as being overweight/unattractive/old etc.</p>

<p>One example that comes to mind is e4's 'My Mad Fat Diary' - how on earth would you cast that role in a tactful way?</p>

Why do some trailers contain scenes that aren't in the movie?,"<p>I'm an avid watcher of trailers. I watch trailers over and over again. I even watch trailers of movies that I don't plan on watching.</p>

<p>But sometimes, I notice that some trailers contain some additional scenes that aren't in the movie.</p>

<p>I noticed this in a few trailers/movies before. A notable example is the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxixDgHUYw"" rel=""noreferrer"">trailer</a> of <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0974015/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Justice League (2017)</a> where the following [amazing] scenes aren't in the movie:</p>

<blockquote>

  </ul>

<p>So, <strong>Why do trailers have those additional scenes? Are those scenes filmed just for the trailers? Isn't that needlessly expensive?</strong></p>

Who decides titles for dubbed versions?,"<p>As we know, many Hollywood movies are dubbed into non English versions. For example, <a href=""https://movies.stackexchange.com/a/84868/48608"">titles of <em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</em></a> are given in different languages. In majority cases, the original title in English is changed into the language it is dubbed in order to suit the taste of the audience. There are other reasons also, e.g <a href=""https://movies.stackexchange.com/q/13508/48608""><em>Thor: The Dark World</em></a>. </p>

<p>Naturally, the movie directors, producers and screenplay writers do not have a command over all the languages the movie is dubbed. In these cases, who takes the responsibility of naming the movie in dubbed versions? Is it the distributor who buys the movie or the dialogue writer or someone else? </p>

<p><sup>Just on a related note, this question is inspired after watching the names of some <a href=""https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-ridiculous-names-given-to-Hollywood-movies-in-Telugu"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">English movies dubbed into Telugu</a> with funny names.

<h2>So, <strong>how/why did these two magician films get created and released at nearly the same time?</strong></h2>
<p>Is this purely coincidence (in which case, that's a perfectly acceptable answer), or, are these movies related in some way? Perhaps, one inspired the other, or, they were apart of a larger &quot;movement/release&quot; of magician films that didn't really take?</p>
",88785,08-05-2018 12:06,Why are two such similar movies being made at the same time?,"<p>Everybody perhaps knows of Jon Favreau's movie <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jungle_Book_(2016_film)"">The Jungle Book</a> which is going to be released in 2016. But quite recently I learned (and to my utter surprise) that another Jungle book movie is coming in 2017 and it's called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungle_Book:_Origins"">Jungle Book: Origins</a>. </p>

<p>Now, this movie has big names too with Christian Bale as Baghera, Benedict Cumberbatch as Sher Khan, Cate Blanchett as Kaa and a young Indian boy in the live action role as Mowgli. </p>

<p>How often does this happen, with two big productions with big cast making a movie on the same subject? I want to ask why this is happening and if there are any really significant differences between the two (apart from the cast, of course).</p>

Would Thanos include himself in his plan?,"<p>In <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em> Thanos wants to kill half the population of the universe, that's clear. And he wants to do that totally in random as well.</p>

<p>So, since he's also part of the universe population, does it mean that there is 50% chance he would die when he would finally snap his fingers after getting all the stones and his wish came true?</p>
",88830,09-05-2018 11:29,Was Thanos really committed or just a hypocrite?,"<p>The title is extremely vague, because this question contains HEAVY spoilers for <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>, specifically the very last scenes of the movie. I can't reasonably put the entire question in spoiler tags, so consider this your warning.</p>

<p>At the end of the movie, Thanos pretty much wins. He gets all the Infinity Stones, Gamora and Vision have been brutally murdered, and the rest of the cast completely beaten. Nobody could stop him. So he executes his plan.</p>

<p>As far as I know (unless I missed something), his plan is to eradicate exactly half of all mortals in the universe, and from his own words, in a fair lottery (random chance), without taking into account a person's wealth, social status, or anything else. Pure chance decides whether you are sacrified for the greater good or live through this greater good (according to him).</p>

<p>During the movie, Thanos and one of his underling (Ebony Maw) say themselves that being sacrified is an honor and should be appreciated. As you would expect, most people do not appreciate being sacrified.</p>

<p>At the end of the movie, Thanos uses all 6 stones to do a finger snap, deleting half the universe.</p>

<p>The question is: Did he exclude himself from the targets? Was there a 50% chance that Thanos himself would disappear right there?</p>

<p>As far as I know, this is not explicitly answered in the movie itself. I am looking for similar situations in the comics (or in the movie if I happened to miss something) where you could know, or have an educated guess, as to Thanos being the kind of person who follows through to the end, even if it means dying, or the kind of person who gets scared of death when it comes down to it, and comes off as an hypocrite.</p>

<p>Some people also mentioned his ""deal"" with Strange would make him spare Tony from the snap too. I'm also wondering about that, if there is a link between the two, but it's not the focus of the question.</p>

<p>The reason I'm wondering is that Thanos seems to me like a very extreme utilitarist. Even though he might be wrong about the value of his plan (Do the remaining half really become happy?), in-universe it seemed successful at least once (Gamora's home planet), so his reasoning is not bad, even if the premise might be horribly flawed. Excluding himself from the snap would make it into a straight villain, while considering himself equal to the rest would make him into a wannabe hero with very very evil methods. This makes a huge difference in the interpretation of the movie and his character.</p>

How Can Thanos believe his plan is sustainable?,"<p>So, I watched Infinity War, and felt like Thanos didn't think things through enough. His plan was to wipe out half of the life in the universe, but would that life not regenerate relatively quickly over the scale of things? Did he plan on snapping his fingers every X amount of years? How could he possibly think this wouldn't turn the entire universe against him? Perhaps it will, and that will be the sequel, but considering he is supposed to be really smart, it seems like a weird solution to the problem. Is Thanos really that short sighted?</p>
",88983,13-05-2018 23:18,Does Thanos's choice make any sense?,"<p>So we know from Infinity War that Thanos was collecting all the Infinity Stones to basically solve the problems brought about by overpopulation on many planets.</p>

<p>But does it make any sense? He could've just easily increased the resources or changed the area or taken appropriate measure to handle that situation. As far as I know, collecting all the Infinity Stones gives the user limitless power and control over the universe in the MCU.</p>

<p>Is Thanos just a mass murderer or is there something I'm missing?</p>

How can Murph look so young after all this time?,"<p>By the end of <em>Interstellar</em> a little maneuvering around the blackhole took Cooper 51 earth years and the time on water the planet took 23 earth years. </p>

<p>So, after almost 90 years Cooper reached the inside of the black hole. But when he was transmitting the Morse code to Murph she was looking pretty young. How is this possible?</p>
",92462,12-09-2018 15:10,How is Cooper's age justified?,"<p>In <em>Interstellar</em> the course of events to my knowledge is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>The time taken to travel from Earth to the wormhole is 2yrs (Aggregate = 2).</li>
<li>After that we don't know how much time passed on Earth while they
were travelling the wormhole. Could be 10yrs judging from the
advancement from the teenager to Casey Affleck (Aggregate = 12).</li>
<li>Then, the time spent on watery planet being ~1-2 hour, assume
12yrs (Aggregate = 24).</li>
<li>Now, by the time they find Mann and Murph declares the death of Dr
Brand, no appreciable time has elapsed as Murph is shown somewhat
the same age as in her previous broadcast. So, no appreciable time
change happens on that (Mann's) planet (Aggregate = 24).</li>
<li>Then the time spent to the point where Cooper ejects into the
blackhole is somewhat insignificant, given the chronology of events (Aggregate = 24).</li>
<li>Now the time spent in the blackhole is again insignificant as Murph
with whom he communicates through the wrist watch has still the same
age, and for the paradox to work, she has to be his current daughter
and not from some other timeline (Aggregate = 24).</li>
<li>After this, the next chronological event is Cooper waking up in the
hospital and being told he is 124yrs old.</li>
</ol>

<p>So assuming his age was 40 when he left Earth, the time taken between him exiting the black hole and being woken up = 124 - 40 - 24(Aggregate) = 60.
So, Murph's age should have been 12 (when Cooper leaves Earth) + 60 = 72yrs.
But she is shown much older on her deathbed, additionally, we are told she was hibernating for 2yrs.

Was Thanos part of the possible 50% that he want to kill?,"<p>So, Thanos's goal was to bring balance to the Universe by eradicating 50% of the living.  I wonder, was he part of the general population that could have died?  In other words, but killing half the living, was he not likely to kill himself as well?</p>
",95760,19-12-2018 13:59,Was Thanos really committed or just a hypocrite?,"<p>The title is extremely vague, because this question contains HEAVY spoilers for <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>, specifically the very last scenes of the movie. I can't reasonably put the entire question in spoiler tags, so consider this your warning.</p>

<p>At the end of the movie, Thanos pretty much wins. He gets all the Infinity Stones, Gamora and Vision have been brutally murdered, and the rest of the cast completely beaten. Nobody could stop him. So he executes his plan.</p>

<p>As far as I know (unless I missed something), his plan is to eradicate exactly half of all mortals in the universe, and from his own words, in a fair lottery (random chance), without taking into account a person's wealth, social status, or anything else. Pure chance decides whether you are sacrified for the greater good or live through this greater good (according to him).</p>

<p>During the movie, Thanos and one of his underling (Ebony Maw) say themselves that being sacrified is an honor and should be appreciated. As you would expect, most people do not appreciate being sacrified.</p>

<p>At the end of the movie, Thanos uses all 6 stones to do a finger snap, deleting half the universe.</p>

<p>The question is: Did he exclude himself from the targets? Was there a 50% chance that Thanos himself would disappear right there?</p>

<p>As far as I know, this is not explicitly answered in the movie itself. I am looking for similar situations in the comics (or in the movie if I happened to miss something) where you could know, or have an educated guess, as to Thanos being the kind of person who follows through to the end, even if it means dying, or the kind of person who gets scared of death when it comes down to it, and comes off as an hypocrite.</p>

<p>Some people also mentioned his ""deal"" with Strange would make him spare Tony from the snap too. I'm also wondering about that, if there is a link between the two, but it's not the focus of the question.</p>

<p>The reason I'm wondering is that Thanos seems to me like a very extreme utilitarist. Even though he might be wrong about the value of his plan (Do the remaining half really become happy?), in-universe it seemed successful at least once (Gamora's home planet), so his reasoning is not bad, even if the premise might be horribly flawed. Excluding himself from the snap would make it into a straight villain, while considering himself equal to the rest would make him into a wannabe hero with very very evil methods. This makes a huge difference in the interpretation of the movie and his character.</p>

How is the presence of Captain America explained?,"<p>Towards the end of 'Endgame', Captain America goes back in time to return all the stones. But instead of returning to the current timeline, he stays back in the earlier timeline and ages naturally.</p>

<p>The question is, <strong>how did he end up back in the present timeline?</strong> It is already mentioned in the movie that altering the past does not alter the future, it merely creates new timelines. So this Captain that travelled back in time cannot exist in the new timeline.</p>

<p>In the present timeline, the young captain exists. In fact, he existed a couple of minutes before the older one turned up. The existence of the younger Captain cannot be changed in the current timeline. This is what Bruce says - changing the past cannot change the future.

How is Hawkeye able to withstand this thing?,"<p>In <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, Hawkeye retrieves the soul stone, holding it in his hand (seemingly without difficulty).  However, in previous movies, e.g., <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> volumes 1 and 2, it's an important plot point that Quill was only able to handle the power stone because of his heritage (i.e., he's a part lowercase-g god, not pure human).</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: How is Hawkeye able to handle the soul stone?</p>

<p>I have two ideas, but I don't know if either of these are accurate:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Simply because he was wearing a glove (if I remember correctly).  Although that seems like pittance compared to an infinity stone.</p></li>
<li><p>The soul stone has effectively ""chosen"" him because of the sacrifice of Black Widow.  Another human in the same setting would be destroyed.  The infinity stones have minds of their own.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Another possibility is that it's only the power stone that destroys humans on contact, but I don't think that's accurate, as it doesn't match Ego's explanation in <em>Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2</em>.</p>

Why is a TV station scrambling dirty words when it created the series themselves?,"<p>I am watching <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magicians_(American_TV_series)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>The Magicians</em></a> and noticed that ""fucking"" (or other variations of ""fuck"" - I did not notice that with other words) is <strong>scrambled</strong> to ""fng"" (more or less). The viewer is expected to recognize the dirty word.</p>

<p>Why would Syfy do that? They created the series so they could have gone with ""freaking"" or something like that instead of a bleeping if they wanted to go for a younger rating.</p>

<p>I do not even think that the rating is the reason - extracted eyeballs or other violent elements would surely require a higher rating. This is not sure, though, as nudity or profanity is usually more problematic in the US than violence (I do not have sources for that).</p>

It's essentially a deconstruction of the young-adult fantasy genre, aimed squarely at grown ups (it includes obvious send-ups of Narnia and Hogwarts).</p>

<p>The show has some pretty adult themes: there's an absurd amount of sex between all variety of participants, lots of death, depression, addiction, etc. Plus, there's a <em>lot</em> of swearing. Every episode contains multiple lines of dialogue where characters use obscene language, and the worst of it (primarily the ""f-word"") gets censored out. </p>

<p>It's that last part that confuses me. As far as I can tell, the show was written and produced specifically for the SyFy channel. Unlike many of SyFy's shows, it's not an Australian or Canadian import. It was produced by a US company, by people who have extensive experience with American network TV (one of the EPs worked on <em>Supernatural</em> for 6 years).</p>

How did Malcolm Crowe not realize something was way off?,"<p>Malcolm interacts with nobody but Cole, and when I say nobody, I mean not a single soul. </p>

<p>I understand that Malcolm is lonely and possibly doesn't have many friends or anything, but this means that he had literally zero interaction with strangers on the street, shop owners (if he ever wanted to buy something), people he knew (if he saw someone he knew, they would've never said ""hi"" back), and was basically invisible to the entire world. Thinking realistically, I don't think a regular person would get through a few hours without realizing that something was really, really wrong if they were invisible to the world (i.e. dead). Are there any explanations for this, or does M. Night just expect you to believe that Malcolm didn't realize that the world (other than Cole) didn't acknowledge his existence in the slightest?</p>

I'm willing to accept plot-holes and Deus Ex Machina type explanations at times for entertainment sake, but there was one item that I wondered about.</p>

<p>David Levinson saves the day by figuring out that they can upload a computer virus into the alien ships that will disabled their defenses and allow the humans to damage their ships. Ok, great. He and Cpt Steven Hiller fly to the mother ship, he somehow is able to communicate through some sort of signals with the alien system, and upload the virus which is made up of some sort of injected code which he pastes into a console.</p>

<p><strong>This leaves me wondering if any attempt is made in the movie or from someone involved in creation the movie to explain how earth technology is able to interact with alien technology.</strong> <strong>Is there a quote from a film maker? Is there a deleted scene where they mention how it works?</strong> Even if they say its midichlorians, this different than simply not addressing it.</p>

Movie about robots from mid to early 2000's,"<p>There is a movie that I watched when I was very young (I'm talking around mid-early 2000's), though I can not remember it. But here is what I remember from it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There was a young man that was in this Science complex.</p></li>
<li><p>In this science complex, there was a large number of robots that had white smooth plating (their heads and bodies were very well shaped to look like a human).</p></li>
<li><p>While in this science complex, there was one robot in particular the man befriended, there was LOTS of hostile robots.</p></li>
<li><p>There was a long range camera shot of the man running along a high up path  with a rail and a colossal drop on the other side of the rail.</p></li>
<li><p>The place he was in was dark, bluish and whitish all in one (to look like a science fiction movie) the drop had a the same sort of colour. The surrounding space was a dull blue grey colour. </p></li>
<li><p>The friendly robot was a fast runner and the man was trying to get away from it but the robot caugth up to him, the man said (I think):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'What do you want from me'?</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>I feel like this is when the man was about to fall over a drop and when the robot was trying to either help him up or do something else I can't remember.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When the robot moves, it made this machine like screaming sound. The robot did talk, though I can't remember what it said.</p></li>
<li><p>The robot was after that protecting the man from other robots trying to kill the man in this massive (colossal) science complex.</p></li>
<li><p>I remember there being some sort of blue sheet like wall that looked like a water fall, but made of some material that robots could pass through easily, and the robot used it to get to the man while chasing him (I think the man ws trying to destroy or lose the robot in some way I can't remember).</p></li>
<li><p>I can't remember the ending at all but I know that the robot ends up getting destroyed (head first) by other robots in an attempt to save the man. The sparks thrown by the robot while being destroyed were a deep blue colour and the robots head snapped to the side.</p></li>
<li><p>When the robot fell to the ground destroyed, it fell in a fluid and smooth like movement, sort of like someone being shot and fall to the ground.</p></li>
<li><p>The movie I believe was filmed in the USA in between the 80's and year 2000. Somewhere in that time frame.</p></li>

"What did the Origami Chicken and the Matchstick Man represent in ""Blade Runner""?","<p>In Blade Runner, Gaff is a rather dark, mysterious figure, who throughout the film, lays down 3 pieces origami - a paper chicken, a matchstick man, and a unicorn made of gum-wrappers. The unicorn is a subtle hint at Deckard being a replicant all along, but what did the other two represent?</p>

<p>Now, just to recap, Gaff puts down the chicken in the scene where Deckard refuses to help Bryant with the case. This makes partial sense to me, as Gaff was trying to imply Deckard was chickening out, although this seems very implausible. He puts down the matchstick man after Deckard investigates Leon's house. Deckard seems to gaze at it in confusion, or maybe even recognizance like he did with the unicorn.</p>

<p>I'm gonna make the bold claim that people are so invested into the unicorn that they easily ignore the two predecessors. What do these two creations in particular represent?</p>

<p>Alternatively, she could have distributed it to the commonfolk and gain major points. Given that she wants the people to believe in her, which is why she did not attack the castles with her dragons, why burn food when winter has arrived? The people will probably not be happy about that.</p>

<p>There was no point to purposely burning the food.  The Lannisters were clearly outnumbered and were easily killed with nowhere to run.  They had no way of sneaking out any of the food either.

<p><a href=""http://movies.wikia.com/wiki/Technicolor"" rel=""noreferrer"">This site</a> claims the effect was due to the final print being constructed late in the process for separate black and white film strips for each primary colour allowing the final dyes to be very vivid and clear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rich colors that the Technicolor process gave came in part from the fact that the color was not added to the process until the final stages. The color information was recorded and processed as separate black and white images which were relatively easy to control and preserve.</p>

<p>Is this a good explanation?</p>

Can the dead cross the Wall?,"<p>At one point Benjen Stark states that</p>

  <p>The Wall is not just ice and stone. Ancient spells were carved into its foundations. Strong magic to protect men from what
  lies beyond. And while it stands, the dead cannot pass.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>By ""the dead"" I only mean the deadmen/wights/animated corpses - not the Night King or the White Walkers.</p>

<p>Now, even after all this time, we see in episode 6 of season 7 that the army of the dead has not even reached the wall yet. Considering the fact that the army of the dead is made out of undeads who don't need (or at least I don't think so) to frequently stop to eat or rest, I was wondering how they haven't made it to the wall yet. </p>

<p>I thought that they maybe could've been retained from heading to the wall by the some of the 3 eyed raven's magic, but even then, Bran had the time to make it back to the wall by being pulled by a young girl on a sled. </p>

How does the Oscar jury know whether a director has done a good job?,"<p>Some Academy Award categories are pretty easy to figure out, such as Best Actor/Actress and Costume Design. However, one that has always puzzled me is Best Director. While we know that a director is generally considered the author of a film, their exact role is not always clear, involving and affecting elements that are already awarded in separate categories (including writing, acting, cinematography, and sound design). </p>

<p>While the director's contribution might be clear to anybody working on the movie in question, it becomes a completely different matter when outside observers, like the Oscar jury, need to evaluate it. It seems impossible for them to decide, based purely on the finished work, how much was actually down to the director.</p>

<p><strong>Given that much or all of a director's role cannot be clearly separated from those of other crew members and unambiguously observed in the finished work, how does the Oscar jury decide which movies should receive an Oscar for direction?</strong></p>

<p>In other words, how does the jury know that the result is not simply down to the writing, the acting, the cinematography, or anything else that the director cannot necessarily be credited with? Is there some unique task performed only by the director that the jury can also observe? Is it more of an overall assessment of a movie's quality that can also be clearly separated from the more general Best Picture award? Do they consult other sources than just the finished work?</p>

<p><em>Note that this is not a question about what a director actually does but rather how the Oscar jury, as outside observers, can disentangle the director's role from those of other crew members with overlapping responsibilities.</em></p>

",82677,14-11-2017 04:20,When is Doctor Strange actually set?,"<p>The films from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) are usually set roughly around the time they are released (barring flashbacks) or at least in a chronological order congruent to their release order. They often reference events from past MCU films or foreshadow future films (e.g. in post-credits scenes). However, with <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1211837/""><em>Doctor Strange</em></a> there seem to be some discrepancies with this approach.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>At first, it seemed a reasonable assumption. There even seems to be a reference to Rhodie's accident in <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498820/""><em>Captain America: Civil War</em></a>, when his assistent presents Dr. Strange with some potential patients and mentions something similar to (quoting from memory)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>an Air Force Colonel paralyzed from the spine in a special protective suit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then there's also the post-credits scene with Thor, which seems to be a foreshadowing of the upcoming <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3501632/""><em>Thor: Ragnar√∂k</em></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>However, someone pointed out, that the reference to the paralyzed Colonel might as well refer to the guy we see in Justin Hammer's failed attempt at copying the Iron Man suit in <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1228705/""><em>Iron Man 2</em></a>. Besides that, we don't exactly know how much time actually passes in <em>Doctor Strange</em>, considering how he seems to go through significant rehab treatment and spends his fortune trying various healing methods before getting involved with sorcery (let alone the time he actually spends studying at Kamar-Taj).</p></li>
<li><p>And then I noticed something really interesting in <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1843866/""><em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em></a>, where Sitwell is interrogated about HYDRA's plans and says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Zola's algorithm is a program for choosing Insight's targets...You! A TV anchor in Cairo, the Under Secretary of Defense, a high school Valedictorian
  in Iowa City, Bruce Banner, <strong>Stephen Strange</strong>, anyone who's a threat to HYDRA.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I wondered if Dr. Strange actually already had his magic powers at the time of <em>The Winter Soldier</em>. Or why else would he be a threat to HYDRA, as much as we know he's just a really good neurosurgeon.</p></li>
<li><p>Then there's also the tidbit that for a Phase 3 movie the film seems a quite traditional origin story, resulting from the possibility that Dr. Strange's inclusion in the MCU might have been decided much later than the other plans for the MCU, based on its overall success and the motivation to take higher risks with less mainstream-famous characters. This <em>might</em> either point to an earlier setting of the film. Or it might as well render the above statement in <em>The Winter Soldier</em> somewhat of a premature blabbing which is now being retconned.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So <strong>is there any secured information about the setting of <em>Doctor Strange</em> within the MCU's timeline</strong> or at least more conclusive hints from this or other MCU movies? If not or if we are to assume it's released roughly chronologically, then <strong>what explains the above statement from <em>The Winter Soldier</em></strong> about Stephen Strange being a threat to HYDRA before his involvement with magic? Or was this really just a throwaway comic reference without much thought or significance put into it?</p>

Mrs. Holly does mention Alex's ""snake accident"", but how is that related to Bob Taylor's snakes at all? And why does he confess to the abductions? </p>

Why is Professor Snape so against Harry Potter when he is supposedly protecting him?,"<p>In the <strong>Harry Potter</strong> series, it is known that Professor Severus Snape tries to protect Harry.</p>

<p>Reason for being is because as a Hogwarts student himself back in the day, he fell on love with who was Lily (Harry's mother). But she had an affair with James Potter.</p>

<p>Because Snape instantly knew that Harry was Lily's son, he dedicated to protecting Harry in the mid to last years of Harry being at Hogwarts.</p>

<p>But as we know, Snape, in the first few years, Snape hated Harry and deducted many points from Griffyndor. </p>

<p>Snape hated Harry, but in the first movie during the Griffyndor vs Slytherin Quidditch match, Quirrel is said and proven to be the one that tried to kill harry by throwing him off his nimbus 2000.  But Snape intervened with a counter- curse to save Harry.</p>

<p>Snape even refereed the second match of Quidditch to make sure Quirrel didn't do it again. That was in the book.</p>

<p>But I don't understand Snape's motivation in the first few years of hatred towards Harry Potter.</p>

<p>But towards the last few years, Snape showed that he cared and protected Harry without hesitation.</p>

The War Machine single-handedly does more damage than possibly all Wakandans.   </p>

Why don't aliens win in most movies?,"<p>Most alien/extra-terrestrial tropes based movies often depict them as losing despite being far more advanced physically and/or technologically. This is seen in cases like Aliens, Predators, Independence Day (computer virus, seriously?!), Species, Pacific Rim, Edge of tomorrow, you name it.</p>

<p>In some movies we see aliens losing interest or probably over protective of humans. Arrival, Day the earth stood still, etc. And in some very few movies it's depicted as though we lost war, like Andromeda Strain (2008 miniseries, not the 1971 movie where we succeed), Invasion of body snatchers, Cloverfield, etc.</p>

<p>I've excluded space opera from this because it deals with way too many species (mostly anthropomorphic) and often end up with a democratic union of sorts. That's out of scope of this question anyway.</p>

<p>The very idea that these aliens have travelled across space is evidence enough of their superiority anyway. Why are film makers hell-bent on showing humans as stalwart heroes who can overcome any sort of adversary who are intellectually, physically and technologically far superior to humans?</p>

<p>Note: This is not a duplicate of <a href=""https://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/47516"">another question</a> as the idea clearly portrays that there are bad guys.

<ul>
<li><p>He can float in water, and even be sent shooting through the air by a relatively gentle flow of water filling a bathtub.  This wouldn't happen if he retained his original mass, as he'd essentially be the densest thing on the planet and should sink like a stone even in a vat of molten lead.</p></li>
<li><p>Upon landing after being ejected from the bathtub, the ceramic tile underneath him shatters.  That takes a significant amount of force, and similar effects are used at other points in the movie where he falls onto (or straight through) various things.</p></li>
<li><p>He's able to get sucked into a vacuum-cleaner.  One that didn't even appear to be a high-end, extra powerful vacuum-cleaner, let alone one capable of sucking up a 200 pound piece of dust.  </p></li>
<li><p>He can run along the barrel of a gun as someone shoots it, apparently without causing them to drop the weapon or even have trouble continuing to aim it.  </p></li>

<p>It's known that the cruise ship and any surroundings after leaving it is in a time loop.</p>

<p>Though Jess remembers the ship and tells Greg, she makes no indication that she is in the time loop. So yes, the movie was meant to confuse the user. But seeing that, according to the number of dead Sallys on board, the time loop occurs more than 20 times.</p>

<p>So, the first time she entered the loop, the storm sent her into an alternate reality with the never-ending time loop? Is this what the movie was showing? I noticed there is a deadly Jess that was not really in the foreground that got shot in the head, and stabs Sally and Downey in one of the rooms. I cannot really place where she falls into the picture seeing that one of the previous Jess instances killed that Jess instead of letting her jump overboard.</p>

"Who is the future ""us"" that Cooper mentioned while he was in the black hole?","<p>While Cooper was in the black hole at the end of <em>Interstellar</em>, TARS mentioned that the walls (which is a 3D space in 5D) were up put by ""them"" (some other higher form of being) and Cooper replied that is was actually put up by future 'us'.</p>

<p>So there is 2 possibilities for this case,</p>

<ol>
<li>'they' is some other higher form of being who mastered 5D apart from humans.</li>
<li>'they' is the future ""us"" which can be the embryos which Dr.Brand developed on Edmunds's Planet or us itself.</li>
</ol>

<p>In first case, there are no complications that the future us is some other higher forms other than humans who put the tesseract in the black hole so that the entire human race could exist.</p>

<p>In second case, if the embryos is our future then there is a complication.</p>

<p>Embryos traveled to other galaxy with the help of Cooper, so when Cooper fell into black hole the embryos didn't even reach the other planet. So how did they put the tesseract in the black hole and for sake we can tell that time is moving very slowly in the black hole so the embryos got the time to get developed and put the tesseract in the black hole, so that he could transmit the quantum data inside the black hole which can crack the gravity equation and send him the Nasa co-ordinates. Now here we again have the controversy, if Cooper is sending the location of Nasa now (while in the black hole), how come initially he came to the black hole (this is a time paradox)?</p>

<p>Since Howard Stark was a founding Member of S.H.I.E.L.D after <em>Captain America: The First Avenger</em> S.H.I.E.L.D has the Tesseract, but given Fury was detained when looking into Project Pegasus (what Mar Vell was working on) this means Project Pegasus wasn't a S.H.I.E.L.D project.</p>

<p>In <strong><a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Avengers: Infinity War</a></strong>, in order to obtain the <strong>Soul Stone</strong>, Thanos has to sacrifice someone he loves. To thwart Thanos, Gamora tries to stab herself, but he turns the knife into bubbles.</p>

<p>Thanos stops Gamora from committing suicide so he can kill her himself, by throwing her off the cliff. </p>

<p><strong>It seems like, for the sacrifice to count, you have to actually kill a person you love.</strong> It's not enough to just lose someone through suicide.</p>

<p>However, in <strong><a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154796/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Avengers: Endgame</a></strong> Natasha sacrifices her own life, with Clint actually trying to save her.

<p><br>My Question(s):</p>

<p>The question is, <strong>how did he end up back in the present timeline?</strong> It is already mentioned in the movie that altering the past does not alter the future, it merely creates new timelines. So this Captain that travelled back in time cannot exist in the new timeline.</p>

<p>In the present timeline, the young captain exists. In fact, he existed a couple of minutes before the older one turned up.

The Fate of the Asgardians on the ship,"<p>How did the Asgardians survive? I've been trying to noodle this through for a while now after seeing <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>. At the End of <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>, the Asgardians are all on Thor's ship looking for new lands. </p>

<p>At the beginning of <em>Infinity War</em>, Thanos attacks the ship and comes aboard. There's been a slaughter and only a few Asgardians are left. Those are either killed directly by Thanos (Helmdal, Loki) or, well, basically Thor, who is picked up by the Guardians of the Galaxy.</p>

<p>In <em>Endgame</em> we find out that there are some Asgardians still alive,</p>

<p>Of course, we learned during <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em> that not all Asgardians are necessarily on Asgard (Valkyrie was living on Sakaar, after all).</p>

"Why do the Avengers struggle so much against Thanos in ""Endgame"", when they managed to resist him in ""Infinity War"" in a supposedly worse situation?","<p>When Thanos fights the Avengers in <em>Infinity War</em>, he always has the Power Stone because that's the first he collected.

<p>In <em>Infinity War</em>, Wanda was destroying the Mind Stone with one hand, while pushing Thanos back with the other hand. And she actually did destroy that Infinity Stone with one hand, so she was using <strong>so much</strong> energy on that mission and wasn't fighting back Thanos in full power. But in <em>Endgame‚Äã</em>, even using both her hands, she is not strong enough to push him back for more than 3 or 4 seconds.</p>
<p>In <em>Infinity War</em>, Captain America, merely a human with strong muscles, can fight Thanos (who had just thrown a moon on Iron Man!) and resist against his punch for some seconds. Meanwhile, Captain Marvel uses her photon blast and superhuman strength to fight him hand-to-hand. Remember that she can carry a spaceship on top of her head all the way from nowhere in space to Earth, and can destroy spaceships just by flying really fast towards them, and doesn't get killed while doing so. Which is faaaaar more that what Steve is capable of, but Thanos throws her like an apple. Or the moon he threw on Tony.</p>

Does anyone know why?</p>
",102190,19-07-2019 10:29,What rules govern how TV show opening credits are structured?,"<p>I've always been curious what decides if a credit is in the opening or closing credits.  It seems loosely that cast (in order of today's ""big name"" significance), directors and financiers get the front spots, and everything else appears later.  But lately I've been developing some specific curiosities about how cast members are credited on TV shows.</p>

<p>Opening credits seem to follow this rough outline:</p>

<p>Part of ""opening credits"" video segment</p>

<ol>
<li>(optional) Major Actors</li>
<li>Show Title</li>
<li>Core Cast Actors</li>
<li>Directors</li>
<li>Producers</li>
<li>(optional) Episode Title</li>
<li>Episode Writers</li>
</ol>

<p>Subtitles over beginning of show, after opening video</p>

<ol>
<li>(Episode Title and Writers may appear here, instead)</li>
<li>Special Guest Actors</li>
</ol>

<p>I've probably missed a few things, and mis-ordered a few things.  But, as I said, my main curiosity is about actor credits.</p>

<p>Typically, there is little indication of which characters the core cast actors play.  Sometimes their name is edited to appear along with an image of the character as an indictator, but sometimes there is no indication.  As I've never seen anyone credited in both the opening and closing credits, that leaves the potential for core actors to never be directly associated with their character.  This seems potentially problematic; is there a reason for this?  Are viewers expected to know who's who?</p>

<p>Guest actors sometimes are simply credited by name (and not being part of the opening video, this means they will never be associated with their character in credits).  But often they are credited as ""<strong>special guest</strong> as <strong>character name</strong>"".  This is quite helpful.</p>

<p>The thing I find really confusing is, sometimes the last few regular cast actors will get the guest actor treatment.  I've seen opening video with ""and <strong>actor</strong> as <strong>character</strong>"" paired with an image of that character for an entire season.  Why does this actor get special treatment?</p>

<p>Finally, sometimes guest actors will be credited at the front following the opening video, sometimes they'll be credited in the closing credits.  Are there rules for deciding who get's credited early or late?</p>

<p>I've sometimes wondered if shows deliberately play with actor's name position to obfuscate plot arcs (""you won't think we're killing of this character if their actor is still in the opening credits"", or ""you won't expect this recurring guest if we place their name in the closing credits"") and I've also wondered if there are thresholds for ""people appearing in XX number or YY percentage of episodes get placed <strong>here</strong>.""  But it's difficult to build a good sampling base for this.  And season 7 of Stargate SG-1 kinda took a shotgun to my guesses so far.</p>

<p>So...  Are there rules?</p>

Is it possible that Arthur Fleck is not the real Joker?,"<p><em>Joker</em> traces the origin story of Arthur Fleck, a troubled man (mentally, financially, and in several other ways) who goes into a downward spiral and emerges as a maniacal killer. My question: is Arthur Fleck the Joker we see in other Batman movies (e.g. Heath Ledger's Joker)? Nothing in the movie seems to confirm this, and - as far as I know - no Batman movie/comic book/etc gives the real name of the Joker. We see at the end of the movie that Arthur (who was introduced as Joker on Murray Franklin's show) starts some sort of movement against the elite of Gotham, and people inspired by him and his actions dress up as Jokers and riot around the city. Is it not entirely plausible that the real Joker is just someone inspired by Arthur, and not Arthur himself? </p>

<p>An example that shows that this theory is not inconsistent with other representations of the Joker: In Dark Knight, when we're first introduced to Ledger's Joker in a bank robbery scene, the other people robbing the bank with him don't seem to know much about him or his name. One of them even describes him as ""some guy who calls himself Joker"". If this Joker is indeed Arthur Fleck - who became infamous after his appearance on Murray Franklin's show - how is it that these people don't know anything about him?</p>

<p>There are two ways she can perceive the future:</p>

How did Jane die?,"<p>In Breaking Bad, season 2, ep 12 ~ ep 13, Jesse's girl friend / landlord Jane died.</p>

<p>She started vomiting during sleep, and died shortly after.</p>

<p>I would imagine vomiting violently like she was would have waken herself up and it would not be so hard to stand up from her bed and saved herself from choking.</p>

<p>Or she die because of other reasons? </p>

<p>I heard of people suffocated themselves with their own vomit due to being deeply drunk, but not being in sleep.</p>

What type of revolver gun used by the Joker that shoots more than 6 bullets?,"<p>In <em>Joker (2019)</em> while the Joker character was assaulted by the 3 men in the train/subway, he pulls out the revolver gun and shoots and kills the men. Some of them are shot 2 or 3 times.</p>

Why do films from before 1917 seem to run faster than normal?,"<p>Why do the scenes in the films of year 1917 and before seem to run faster than the normal speed? Does it have to do something with the equipment of that era or that the actors used to act like that?</p>
",109872,06-07-2020 08:38,Frame rates of early movies,"<p>If I am correct, films run at 24 fps. Early, we saw jerky and rapid movements of people. This was, I think, 16 fps.</p>

<p>However, we have seen earlier films (like the first kiss) at 24 fps it seems.</p>

<p>Also the famous brontosaurus  (Bab?) seems at a faster rate than 16. Why did films seems to start off with 24 fps but later... such as in the 1920's we see the 16 fps,  then back to the 24 fps In the late 20's mid 30's?</p>

How did Sherlock fake his death?,"<p>To be honest, I am quite bit confused about the <strong>&quot;faked death&quot;</strong> scene of Sherlock himself in the BBC series <em>Sherlock</em>.</p>
<p>The beginning of Season 3, Episode 1 shows that he escaped with the help of the rope/cord attached to the back of his coat and he seemingly broke into the nearby building and then left from there.</p>
<p>However when Anderson confronts him later, he actually tells another story of him jumping on an inflatable sofa (or something like that) and escaping the site. All the while John is hypnotised.</p>
<p>So I was looking for an answer that would help clear my dilemma.</p>
