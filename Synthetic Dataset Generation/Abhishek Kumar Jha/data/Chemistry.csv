Why do we use pV term independent of U in the equation H = U + pV?,"<p>I have read the following definition of enthalpy in my textbook:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A substance has to occupy some space in its surroundings depending upon its volume (<span class=""math-container"">$V$</span>). It  does against the compressing influence of the atmospheric pressure (<span class=""math-container"">$p$</span>). Due to this,the substance possesses an additional energy called <span class=""math-container"">$pV$</span> energy which is given by the product of pressure (<span class=""math-container"">$p$</span>) and volume (<span class=""math-container"">$V$</span>) of the system.</p>
<p>The sum of internal energy and <span class=""math-container"">$pV$</span> energy of any system, under given set of conditions, is called enthalpy. It is denoted by <span class=""math-container"">$H$</span> and is also called <strong>heat content</strong> of the system. Mathematically, it may be put as <span class=""math-container"">$$H = U + pV$$</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's suppose we have some water in a test tube at room temperature open to atmosphere. It will have internal energy which consist of kinetic energy of  molecules, chemical energy, rotational energy and some other forms of energy. In order to occupy some space in its surroundings, the molecules of the water should vibrate in such a way that they cancel out the compressing influence of the air molecules present in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>So if we try to measure the internal energy of the system, isn't the energy required to make space for the surroundings already included in the internal energy of the system. <strong>Why do we add an extra term <span class=""math-container"">$pV$</span> along with internal energy <span class=""math-container"">$U$</span> to measure the heat content of the system?</strong></p>

It means that conjugate base (ammonia) is really stable, which makes conjugate acid a strong acid.</p>

<p>Another argument why ammonium should be strong acid is comparison with hydronium ion $\ce{H3O+}$. Both nitrogen (EN = 3.04) and oxygen (EN = 3.44) are significantly electronegative atoms and ""don't like"" to be positively charged.

Valid resonance contributors for 2-methylthiazole,"<p>There's a problem from an old exam that I was trying to do.

There's then a bold note that says, ""As always, you should remember that linear atoms (sp hybridization) are not expected in rings of this size."" So, my professor said that the circled electron pair in red is localized to the nitrogen atom, which therefore means that the resonance contributor on the right is invalid.</p>

<p>So, just to double check my logic, I'm assuming that the circled pair on right is localized because by moving them as if they were a delocalized pair, it would change the hybridization of nitrogen from sp2 to sp, which would make it's electronic geometry linear. Therefore, the pair on the nitrogen is localized because of the bold note (As always, you should remember that linear atoms (sp hybridization) are not expected in rings of this size) correct?</p>

Nucleophilicity in Polar Aprotic Solvent,"<p>Why is it that fluoride is more nucleophilic than iodide in an aprotic solvent? The Clayden textbook suggests that lower-row elements of the periodic table are more nucleophilic since their valence electrons are in higher energy levels and are therefore more reactive. However according to the slides from my lecture class, the order of nucleophilicity for halides in an aprotic solvent goes from F- > Cl- > Br- > I- which is opposite from what is stated in the Clayden textbook.

<p>The reasons given by Solomons and Fryhle<sup>[1]</sup>, and by Wade<sup>[2]</sup> are basically as follows.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Smaller anions are more solvated than bigger ones because of their 'charge to size ratio'. Thus, smaller ions are strongly held by the hydrogen bonds of the solvent.</p></li>
<li><p>Larger atoms/ions are more polarizable. Thus, larger nucleophilic atoms/ions can donate a greater degree of electron density to the substrate than a smaller nucleophile whose electrons are more tightly held. This helps to lower the energy of the transition state.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Clayden et al.<sup>[3]</sup> give the reason that in S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions, the HOMO–LUMO interaction is more important than the electrostatic attraction. The lone pairs of a bigger anion are higher in energy compared to a smaller anion. So, the lone pairs of a bigger anion interact more effectively with the LUMO σ*. Thus, soft nucleophiles react well with saturated carbon.</p>

<p>What I don't understand is the trend of halide nucleophilicity in polar aprotic solvents. </p>

<p>$$\ce{F- &gt; Cl- &gt; Br- &gt; I-}$$</p>

<p>In aprotic solvents, only the solvation factor is absent. Bigger anions are still more polarizable and can interact in a better way with the LUMO. Then, what is the reason for the trend reversal in aprotic solvents? Solomons and Fryhle<sup>[1]</sup> say</p>

  <p>In these[aprotic] solvents anions are unencumbered by a layer of solvent molecules and they are therefore poorly stabilized by solvation. These “naked” anions are highly reactive both as bases and nucleophiles. In DMSO, for example, the relative order of reactivity of halide ions is opposite to that in protic solvents, and it follows the same trend as their relative basicity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Shouldn't the orbital interactions matter more than the electrostatic attractions even in polar aprotic solvents? Why does nucleophilicity follow the basicity trend in polar aprotic solvents?</strong></p>

"When a molecule loses hydrogen atoms, does it become oxidised?","<p>I had the following question on a bio test covering cell respiration and glycolysis, but I'm not sure if I agree with the answer. </p>

Good summary of highschool to university chemistry,"<p>DISCLAIMER: I've browsed similar questions, but sadly they refer to books that're either too basic or too specialized.</p>

<p>Hello. I'm studying mechanical engineering (1st year), and we have to do a module in chemistry. It's mostly highschool chemistry (equilibrium, redox reactions, acids and bases, ...) with small snippets from unknown topics, such as thermodynamics and crystal structures. We are now beginning with ""the chemistry of non-metals"", and will eventually cover ""the basics of organic chemistry"" and ""the chemistry of metals and solids"". The problem is, we've gotten a new professor who's awful as an educator: he barely speeks the language, and never prepares the lessons. Instead, he just clicks through powerpoint presentations, slowly reading them out, while facing the screen.</p>

<p>I've found that - although more productive than his ""lessons"" - just reading the presentations is not enough. I recognize what I already know, but require an unreasonable ammount of time to understand the rest, which usually involves browsing wikipedia.</p>

<p>That's why I'd like to ask if anyone could suggest a book that summerizes highschool chemistry, and ventures into topics above highschool level in a way someone with a highschool education would understand. Obviously, alternative mediums such as videos are also fine. I just want something that more or less complements the lectures, and can always just google whatever details are not covered.</p>

$$\ce{NH4+ + H2O &lt;-&gt; NH3 + H3O+}$$</p>

<p>(Being a constant allows us to relate the molar concentration to the density of water.)</p>

<p>And so, even though some quantity of water reacts with $\ce{NH4+}$, but the volume of water varies in a way that $\ce{[H2O]}$ would still be constant.</p>

<p>What I don't understand is why the molar concentration of water is constant. Why isn't it handled the same way as the other reactant?
I understand that if $\ce{H2O}$ was the only liquid and the rest of the reactants and products were of different state (gaseous or solid), then water would exist alone in the beaker and its concentration would therefore remain constant, but this is not the case. </p>

<p>That was about heterogeneousness. Trying another guess; in the reaction of esterification $$\ce{{alcohol} + {carboxylic acid} &lt;-&gt; {ester} + H2O}$$
$\ce{H2O}$ is considered as a product which concentration is not constant, so it is counted explicitly in the equilibrium constant.</p>

<p>Hi I am not really all that well versed in chemistry or molecules for that matter but I am trying to find a way to ""create"" a scientific and realistic (trough probably unlikely) world with large crystal formations on the surface. The reason I want this is because I want to create a species for my novel that has its culture based around the large crystal formations living on the planet.</p>

<p>Now to limit my question a bit I would like the answer to these two points:</p>

<ul>
<li>What kind of crystal(s).</li>
<li>How do you think the process should work.</li>
<li>What limitations it creates.</li>
</ul>

<p>The criteria are that:</p>

<ul>
<li>The crystals must be permanent without breaking down in normal earth conditions/atmosphere.</li>
<li>Preferably no interference required by intelligent lifeforms.</li>
<li>There will be oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</li>

<p>What are the tools?:</p>

<p>Well you can more or less use anything in nature, you can make suns explode if need be. But a more probable start would be selecting the chemical composition and what would be needed to form crystals from that point.</p>

<p>For instance if you need a long period of very high heat and then cooling down to “normal” temperatures you can make the system sun go red giant and heating the planet before becoming a white dwarf.</p>

Why do significant figure rules contradict each other?,"<p>So I came across a problem in my chemistry textbook that brought up another question. The problem had to do with calculating the mass% composition of chlorine in a certain molecule.</p>

<p>So to go about solving this, you could calculate the mass in grams of 1 mole of the molecule and divide the mass in grams of the corresponding amount of moles of chlorine by that number and multiply that by 100 to get a percent.</p>

<p>The molecule had 3 Cl molecules, so I would look and see that the molar mass of 1 mole of Cl is 35.45g. So I would multiply that by 3 to get 106.35g of Cl, but I would have to round that to 4 significant figures since 3 has infinite significant figures, and the mass of Cl was given in 4. Which means the mass of 3 moles of Cl is 106.4g. </p>

<p>Which poses my question... Isn’t multiplying the molar mass of Cl by 3 the same as adding the molar mass of Cl 3 times? And if so, wouldn’t that mean that if you were to add the mass 3 times, then the significant figure rules for adding would tell us to round to the number in the problem with the least decimal places, which is 2 decimal places? So when you add the mass of Cl 3 times you get 106.35g so then you round to 2 decimal places and get 106.35g.</p>

<p>Why does this give a different answer? How come when you multiply by a number with infinite significant figures, the number of significant figures in your rounded answer can be different than if you were to add that something to itself that same amount of times? </p>

<p>Can’t you be certain to the tenths place in this example, and have the hundredths place by your uncertain digit since when you add, you don’t have to round any numbers off? If not, why not?</p>

",122753,21-10-2019 15:38,Scientific Reason for Salt Solution Gaining Volume,"<p>A little background to this question: my mom placed a glass with salt and enough water to just cover the salt in a room to ""absorb negative energy"" out of the room at her office. It obviously ""worked"". So when I arrive home from university she asked me if salt water draws moisture out of the air — and explains to me what happened.</p>

<p>The scientist part of me is curious, because you cannot ""absorb negative energy"" using salt water. So I placed salt in a glass, covered it with enough water and left it overnight. To my surprise, the volume of water increased by around 20-25%, the glass is <em>significantly</em> more fill. </p>

<p>My question is this: why?</p>

<p>I have 2 thoughts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Somehow the ions in the solution as the salt dissolved have charges that repel other molecules making more space in between molecules and therefore increasing the apparent volume.  </li>
<li>Because it is a salt solution some form of osmosis occurs to actually absorb moisture out of the air.</li>
</ol>

<p>My next idea is to redo this later today but weigh the glass and solution first to see if it gains mass. That would support <strong>2</strong>. If no mass gain, then I assume something similar to <strong>1</strong> is happening.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>P. S. I am an applied mathematician so I have no background in the specifics of chemistry and how molecules and ions etc. etc. interact. </p>

<p>P. S. S.: I also couldn't find an answer to this on the internet. IN FACT salt added to water appears to reduce the volume in a lot of information I read.    </p>

<p>Two other places on this site go into detail about this matter but I feel like it is either not totally correct or just not fully explained. I assume I must not fully understand in the first place, also. The two links are posted immediately below pertaining to the subject. </p>

<p><a href=""https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/116302/where-does-the-energy-come-from-to-lower-the-temperature-of-a-brine-solution"">Where does the energy come from to lower the temperature of a brine solution?</a></p>

<p><a href=""https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/5748/why-does-ice-water-get-colder-when-salt-is-added"">Why does ice water get colder when salt is added?</a></p>

<p>How can the ice be cooling as it melts, as these links seem to claim?  I understand that it would be cooling its surroundings by needing to absorb heat to melt, but it's a phase transition so the temperature of the ice should remain constant. Furthermore, if the temperature remains constant, and the ice continues to absorb heat from the water surrounding it in order to melt since it's above its depressed freezing point, wouldn't you have the impossible feat of heat flowing from cold to hot as the water gets continuously colder, as alleged? </p>

<p>Energy is being used in the phase change from solid ice to liquid water. Heat is being absorbed by the ice. Yes, the ice freezes at a much lower temperature and so it will be liquid at a certain range of higher temperatures than it otherwise would be without salt. As it melts it tries to approach its new 
ice-water-salt equilibrium which will be at a depressed freezing point. Why does the temperature fall? Especially if phase changes occur at constant temperature? </p>

<p>The energy must be coming from somewhere and going to somewhere, but where? And how can a hot-to-cold temperature difference for heat transfer actually be maintained if the salt solution is getting colder but the phase change (melting ice) is constant temperature?</p>

However, the treatment there is qualitative and I do not really understand the reasoning for the disclusion of solids and liquids from the reaction qoutient that is presented there. I have attempted to derive this fact mathematically and failed, which why I ask this question again.</p>

<p>Let us look at an example reaction which involves solids and gases. The treatment for other reactions or reactions with liquids shouldn't differ significantly. A very simple reaction for this matter will be the combustion of graphite</p>

<p>$$\ce{C(s) + O2(g) -&gt; CO2(g)}$$</p>

<p>Reaction quotients are derived from the equation for change in Gibbs free energy at nonstandard pressures, so let's find that. Suppose the reaction is carried out in nonstandard pressure, and $\Delta G^o_r$ is known. Let's (I) compress the system isothermally to standard pressure, (II) carry out the reaction and then (III) return it isothermally to the original pressure.</p>

<p>I. $\Delta G$ for the oxygen here is the well known $RT\ln (1/(P/P_o))$. For the carbon: In any isothermal process $dG=VdP$, let's assume for our ideal solid that the volume is constant (I have also tried this in a model where the volume changes with pressure with bulk moduli, the result does not differ significantly), so $\Delta G=V(P-P_o)$.</p>

<p>II. Here simply $\Delta G=\Delta G^o_r$.</p>

<p>III. Here it's just gas compressing so again $\Delta G=RT\ln (P/P_o)$</p>

<p>Adding the contributions from all three stages we have
$$
\Delta G=RT\ln (1/(P/P_o))+V(P-P_o)+\Delta G^o_r+RT\ln (P/P_o)=\Delta G^o_r+V(P-P_o)
$$</p>

<p>This result is different from what a model of an activity of unity for the carbon would predict. What went wrong? And why are activities of solids and liquids taken to be unity? Any help will be appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Difficulty 1:</strong> I don't get why a salt bridge is needed. People say it's to maintain the overall neutrality. But in both cases where  salt bridge is a tube of solution and a membrane, two half cells can be seen as one. So as long as no thing leaves either of the two half cells, the whole is always neutral.</p>

<p><strong>Difficulty 2:</strong> as in the picture, cations go to the right cell, and anions go to the left. I can understand that anions go the left because the number of zinc ions increase as the reaction proceed. But in the right half cell, the electrons are being absorbed, its charge cancelled by that of the copper ion; I don't see any need for sodium ions to move to the right.</p>

<li>Oxygen's lone pair can attack an empty p-orbital and form a formal charge-separated complex with the carbon dioxide. </li>

When you look for answers for popular questions, you usually see them with a variable degree of reliability and complexity. Unfortunately, for this one, I only observed very very crude and general rules of thumb. So let's get a real answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A network solid or covalent network solid is a chemical compound (or element) in which the atoms are bonded by covalent bonds in a continuous network extending throughout the material. In a network solid there are no individual molecules, and the entire crystal may be considered a macromolecule. Formulas for network solids, like those for ionic compounds, are simple ratios of the component atoms represented by a formula unit. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_covalent_bonding"" rel=""noreferrer"">Covalent network, wikipedia</a></p>

<p>If you face a new chemical formula, how would you assume it's a covalent network? (In case it is) Is it somehow done by drawing the Lewis structure? Is there a rule for this? Or is it only possible to know such thing with experimental data?</p>

<hr>

<p>Fun fact: I'm preparing for an internal chemistry olympiad. The examiners usually take all the exceptions into account. So general rules such as ""if it contains Si, it's a covalent network"" aren't really reliable for me. Better phrased, I'm looking for a rule with the least exceptions.</p>

<p>Each carbon atom promotes one electron from its $s$ orbital to the empty $2p$ orbital. It hybridizes two $p$ orbitals with the $s$ to form three $sp^2$ orbitals which it then uses to form three $\sigma$ bonds, two with other carbons and one with a hydrogen.</p>

<p>The remaining unhybridized $p$ orbital then sticks out above and below the plane of the ring. The electrons from all the six unhybridized $p$ orbitals of the six carbons are then delocalized above and below the plane of the ring. </p>

<p>EDIT: This has been suggested as a duplicate of <a href=""https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/80780/what-volume-does-one-mole-of-an-ideal-gas-occupy"">What volume does one mole of an ideal gas occupy?</a>, which does not answer my question because it derives the liter/mol conversion from the ideal gas constant.</p>
",105201,04-12-2018 06:23,What volume does one mole of an ideal gas occupy?,"<p>This has been bugging me for a while now...</p>

<p>Obviously, to calculate the volume/space occupied by a mole of (an ideal) gas, you'll have to specify temperature ($T$) and pressure ($P$), find the gas constant ($R$) value with the right units and plug them all in the ideal gas equation $$PV = nRT.$$</p>

<p>The problem? It seems to be some sort of common ""wisdom"" all over the Internet, that one mole of gas occupies $22.4$ liters of space. But the standard conditions (STP, NTP, or SATP) mentioned lack consistency over multiple sites/books. Common claims: A mole of gas occupies,</p>

<ol>
<li>$\pu{22.4 L}$ at STP</li>
<li>$\pu{22.4 L}$ at NTP</li>
<li>$\pu{22.4 L}$ at SATP</li>
<li>$\pu{22.4 L}$ at <em>both</em> STP and NTP</li>
</ol>

<p><a href=""https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/search?q=22.4"">Even Chem.SE</a> is rife with the ""fact"" that a mole of ideal gas occupies $\pu{22.4 L}$, or some extension thereof.</p>

<p>Being so utterly frustrated with this situation, I decided to calculate the volumes occupied by a mole of ideal gas (based on the ideal gas equation) for each of the three standard conditions; namely: Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), Normal Temperature and Pressure (NTP) and Standard Ambient Temperature and Pressure (SATP).</p>

<p>Knowing that,</p>

<ul>
<li>STP: $\pu{0 ^\circ C}$ and $\pu{1 bar}$</li>
<li>NTP: $\pu{20 ^\circ C}$ and $\pu{1 atm}$</li>
<li>SATP: $\pu{25 ^\circ C}$ and $\pu{1 bar}$</li>
</ul>

<p>And using the equation, $$V = \frac {nRT}{P},$$
where $n = \pu{1 mol}$, by default (since we're talking about one mole of gas).</p>

<p>I'll draw appropriate values of the gas constant $R$ from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_constant"" rel=""noreferrer"">this Wikipedia table</a>:</p>

<p>The volume occupied by a mole of gas should be:</p>

P &amp;= \pu{1 bar},&amp;
R &amp;= \pu{8.3144598 \times 10^-2 L bar K^-1 mol^-1}.
\end{align}
Plugging in all the values, I got 
$$V = \pu{22.698475 L},$$ 
which to a reasonable approximation, gives
$$V = \pu{22.7 L}.$$</p></li>

Plugging in all the values, I got 
$$V = \pu{24.04280003 L},$$

  <li>I believe Martin's approach (basically frontier MO) is fundamentally
  correct. I would be more convinced that his actual numbers are
  meaningful if he were to calculate 1) the carbonyl carbon LUMO
  coefficient and 2) the HOMO-LUMO separation for the following series
  of compounds in order to see if his calculated values correlated with
  this order of reactivity of carbonyl compounds towards nucleophilic
  attack (we could use water as the nucleophile) - but Martin, I think
  such calculations might be a poor use of your time and resources.</li>

<p>I am supposed to work out which product is formed in which solvent when naphthalen-1-olate is treated with benzyl iodide.</p>

<p>DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent, as it does not possess an acidic hydrogen. So, the negative charge on oxygen will be concentrated as the anion will be poorly solvated. Hence, it should act as a hard nucleophile. Since alkyl halides such as BnI are soft electrophiles, I think that the substituent should preferentially add to the ring. </p>

<p>In 2,2,2-trifluoroethan-1-ol (TFE), I think the reaction would proceed via an S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism. Now, the carbocation is a hard electrophile, and thus <em>O</em>-alkylation might be observed.</p>

<p>But considering the better solvation of the negatively charged oxygen in TFE, it would also be more hindered, which suggests that <em>C</em>-alkylation might also be seen.</p>

<p>The reasons given by Solomons and Fryhle<sup>[1]</sup>, and by Wade<sup>[2]</sup> are basically as follows.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Smaller anions are more solvated than bigger ones because of their 'charge to size ratio'. Thus, smaller ions are strongly held by the hydrogen bonds of the solvent.</p></li>
<li><p>Larger atoms/ions are more polarizable. Thus, larger nucleophilic atoms/ions can donate a greater degree of electron density to the substrate than a smaller nucleophile whose electrons are more tightly held. This helps to lower the energy of the transition state.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Clayden et al.<sup>[3]</sup> give the reason that in S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions, the HOMO–LUMO interaction is more important than the electrostatic attraction. The lone pairs of a bigger anion are higher in energy compared to a smaller anion. So, the lone pairs of a bigger anion interact more effectively with the LUMO σ*.

  <p>In these[aprotic] solvents anions are unencumbered by a layer of solvent molecules and they are therefore poorly stabilized by solvation. These “naked” anions are highly reactive both as bases and nucleophiles. In DMSO, for example, the relative order of reactivity of halide ions is opposite to that in protic solvents, and it follows the same trend as their relative basicity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Shouldn't the orbital interactions matter more than the electrostatic attractions even in polar aprotic solvents? Why does nucleophilicity follow the basicity trend in polar aprotic solvents?</strong></p>

<p>But why does this happen? Some may think it is because one of the bonding atoms have strong electronegativity. But experimental evidence suggests otherwise.</p>

<p>For example, carbon monoxide. The EN of carbon is 2.6, and oxygen 3.4. This may lead you to think that carbon will donate a pair of electron, but on Princeton.edu:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Carbon monoxide (CO) can be viewed as containing one coordinate bond and two ""normal"" covalent bonds between the carbon atom and the oxygen atom. This highly unusual description illustrates the flexibility of this bonding description. Thus in CO, carbon is the electron acceptor and oxygen is the electron donor.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in some cases like NO2, it does follows that the less electronegative atom domates electron. But why??</p>

Why gas solubility decreases with temperature?,"<p>I found this quote on a <a href=""https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry)/Equilibria/Solubilty/Temperature_Effects_on_Solubility"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chemistry LibreTexts website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the heat given off in the dissolving process is greater than the heat required to break apart the solid, the net dissolving reaction is exothermic (energy given off). The addition of more heat (increases temperature) inhibits the dissolving reaction since excess heat is already being produced by the reaction. This situation is not very common where an increase in temperature produces a decrease in solubility.</p>

<p>Also, are these explanations of why the ration changes for the other factors right:</p>

<ul>
<li>Temperature - equilibrium moves to the endothermic side of the reaction as temperature increases because the activation enthalpy of the exothermic reaction increases as the overall energy of the system is less </li>
<li>Concentration - ratio of products/reactants changes immediately after one part of the reaction's concentration increases, it then approaches the same ratio (assuming one whole side of the reaction is added)</li>
<li>Catalysts do nothing more than decrease the time it takes to reach equilibrium as they catalyse both sides of a reversible reaction and reduce the activation enthalpy</li>

Hybridisation of POCl3,"<p>I was doing lewis structures and i came across a question asking the structure of POCl3. Here, the answer is a tetrahedral shape with P as central atom connected to 3Cl atoms by a single bond and 1 oxygen atom by a double bond. The valency of P is 3. So, it needs 3 electrons to get the nobel gas configuration and become stable so it could have formed single bonds with 2 cl atoms and single bond with an oxygen atom which would be single bonded to cl atom. Why isn't this structure correct? </p>

<p>And how can P form 4 bonds while it needs only 3? I think it's something related to D-orbital but if it undergoes sp3d hybridisation, it would need 5 bonds. Also, the structure of this compound is tetrahedral and hybridisation of P is sp3. How can this be? How can it form 4 bonds although it has only 3 unpaired electrons? Nitrogen couldn't form such compounds.</p>

<p>I googled about it and could find nothing but the hybridisation and lewis structure. My actual question isn't answered anywhere</p>

It seems to me that this would result in the Phosphorus atom having ten electrons in its outer shell (four from the double bond with the oxygen and two each from the single bonds with the other three oxygens).</p>

<p>Apart from the oxygen with a double-bond, we have three oxygens forming single bonds. Does this not leave them one electron short?</p>

Why doesn't lithium form dilithium crystals? (Calling Mr.Spock),"<p>Hydrogen is in the first column of the periodic table. At STP it is a diatomic gas. When cooled and/or under pressure it forms a crystalline solid of di-hydrogen molecules. Calculations indicate that under high enough pressure it may form a monatomic basis metallic crystal, and scientists are actively looking to find evidence of this. Results so far seem inconclusive.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Exergonic: I have sodium bicarbonate and vinegar. Would it be catabolic, spontaneous, and <span class=""math-container"">$-\Delta G$</span> as well?</p>
<p>Sodium bicarbonate and vinegar is your basic science-fair volcano reaction. You have the baking soda in a container of some sort and pour the vinegar. The formula would be something like
<span class=""math-container"">$$\ce{Bicarbonate of soda + vinegar -&gt; Carbonic acid + Water + Carbon dioxide gas}.$$</span></p>
</li>
<li><p>Endergonic: I have ammonium chloride and water. Would it be anabolic, nonspontaneous, and <span class=""math-container"">$+\Delta G$</span>?</p>
<p>Ammonium chloride would be dissolved into the water. The formula would be something like
<span class=""math-container"">$$\ce{NH4Cl + water -&gt; NH4+ + Cl-}$$</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I've just barely touched on the <span class=""math-container"">$G$</span> value thing. I don't exactly know what's going on there. What I mean I guess is that if it's <span class=""math-container"">$+\Delta G$</span>, the enthalpy increases, and if it's <span class=""math-container"">$-\Delta G$</span>, the enthalpy decreases. To be more precise, we're on the Gibbs free energy lesson at the moment.</p>
<p>Endergonic means energy is absorbed during the reaction. Exergonic means that energy is released during the reaction. Is energy released or absorbed during a vinegar and baking soda reaction? Is energy released or absorbed when dissolving ammonium chloride and water?</p>

<p>It is written in the third point ( shown in the picture) that presence of d orbitals results in stronger metallic bond.</p>

<p>1) We check the strength of metallic bonding to compare the melting and boiling point in case of metals. According to the general trend, melting and boiling point decreases down in the group( in s block) because the strength of metallic bonding decreases.</p>

<p>Can the ineffective shielding by d electrons be so much effective in decreasing the size of cation?</p>

What Is A Hydrogen Bond?,"<p>I know this might be a bit of a silly question, but what is a hydrogen bond? I always thought that (say in water for example) the hydrogen was slightly more negative than the other ion (oxygen). But hear me out, this is because the shared electron (between the hydrogen and the oxygen due to their covalent bond) is slightly closer to the hydrogen's positive nucleus (than the oxygen's positive nucleus). </p>

<p>And since both are gaining an electron, that additional electron had more of an effect on the overall hydrogen ion (and less so of an effect on the oxygen ion) than a charge of exactly -1. Therefore if the charge of the hydrogen ion is now is slightly less than -1 and the charge of the oxygen is slightly more than -1, then the hydrogen is more negative than the oxygen...</p>

"A drop of water in a tin of sugar: Which one's the solvent, the sugar or the water?","<p>The other day, when we were dealing with the chapter <em>Solutions</em>, our teacher asked us this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I add a <em>drop</em> of water, to a tin full of sugar (without mixing it in), what's the solvent here? The water or the sugar?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Naturally we were taken aback by the 'unorthodox' nature of the question. Seeing that none of us were in a position to answer <em>that</em> any time soon, he gave us the ""answer"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's the <strong>sugar</strong>. If you remember the definition we learnt ( <em>solute + solvent = solution; between the solute and the solvent, the solvent is one present in a <strong>larger</strong> quantity and is in the <strong>same</strong> phase/state of matter as the solution</em> ) you ought to have realized that, since there's more sugar than water, and at the end of the process the tin's filled with a solid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that may seem like a clever way of testing our command of terminologies and definitions, but I saw a hitch there.</p>

<p>A solution is defined as a <strong>homogeneous</strong> mixture.</p>

<p>Adding a drop of water to a tin of sugar (without mixing it in) does <strong>not</strong> result in a homogeneous mixture. So as interesting as the question is, I feel it's flawed on this account... because what we're dealing with isn't technically even a solution.</p>

<p>Now I told this to my teacher, but he (quite deftly) side-stepped my query...a subtle way of indicating that he's not comfortable discussing this. </p>

<p>So I guess my question here boils down to this:</p>

<p><strong>Was my teacher's ""answer"" correct? Or was the question seriously flawed to begin with?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT-</p>

<p>I wouldn't call this a duplicate. Sure, I mean, both my question and the other one that was linked with this was about identifying the solvent and solute but I feel my question is <strong>distinct</strong> because:</p>

<p>1) It isn't answered well enough in the other question (that answer was <em>too</em> generalized... I've given a <em>specific</em> instance here)</p>

<p>2) I also want to know if a drop of water added to a tin full of sugar (without mixing it) can be considered a solution.</p>

On Google I found, that active mass is actually a ratio of mass which participates in reaction and total mass and it goes true with the fact written in my text book, that active mass of pure liquid and pure solids is unity.

Where is the probability of finding an electron in 1s orbital maximum?,"<p>So the way I understand the question is that it asks us at what r (distance from nucleus) and at what angles is the probability going to be maximum. The way I see probability of finding at a point in a meaningful sense is, just like in 1D probability of finding particle at a point is taken as probability it is in dx region beside it, we find probability of finding it in a small volume near the point of interest. 
Now the probability density of 1s orbital times dV in polar coordinates will end up containing a sine term (since small volume in polar cooditnates contains sine of angle with z axis). Thus the probability is dependent on not just r but also angle with z axis, which isn't expected for such a spherically symmetric orbital. I am confused here.</p>

<p>Of course one could say that since this is spherically symmetric, probability depends only on r and thus use only radial probability distribution and maximise it. But why is the above way which seems more general giving an apparently different answer.</p>

<p>Sorry if the above part isn't clear or is messy. Just to clarify things, I am not asking a ""how to find"" question. One way to look at my question is that if instead of maximising radial probability distribution, if I evaluate probabilities in small volume around points and maximise it, my answer should match with the one I get from maximising radial probability distribution. Consequently, I should get all points on sphere with Bohr radius but on maximising probability in small volume around a point, I get points at Bohr radius and on XY plane only (since for maxima, sine must be 1 meaning perpendicular to z axis). </p>

<p>At the same time, we all agree that the Bohr radius is the distance at which probability of finding the electron is maximum for 1s orbital.</p>

And then it goes on to calculate the formal charges on different oxygen atoms in it(which are shown in figure with <span class=""math-container"">$+/-$</span> signs.) In justification of the structure it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Formal charges help in the selection of the lowest energy structure from a number of possible Lewis structures for a given species.

Can a covalent bond exist with one electron shared?,"<p>I was doing an exercise with formal charges on anions and it occurred to me that the issues with incomplete octets could be solved with sharing 1 electron between constituent atoms of the ion. To illustrate:

<p>This would be the Lewis structure of a resonance form of the nitrite ion, without bringing in an electron from an external source to complete Nitrogen's octet. Nitrogen basically needs to fill it's octet, so it becomes charged -1 by bringing an electron in from another source. </p>

<p>My question - could the octet be completed if one of the Oxygen atoms shared one of its electrons with the Nitrogen? Like in a dative bond where oxygen contributes its pair of electrons, instead in this case it just donates a single electron? This would satisfy all octets without needing to have an 'extra' electron. What is the need for covalent bonds to share pairs of electrons? Can't covalent bonds exist where only 1 electron is shared between molecules? After all, NaCl is a case where a single electron is used in a ionic bond rather than a covalent bond, so what's the issue with using a single electron in covalent bond?</p>

What's actually happening to cause the shift? </p>

",123356,04-11-2019 11:47,Chemical Equilibrium - Why do changes in pressure cause a shift in the ratio of products and reactants?,"<p>I understand Le Chatelier's principle and how every change to an equilibrium system causes an opposing reaction from the system. I also understand how, when pressure is increased, the equilibrium shifts to the side with the lowest number of moles of gas and vice versa.</p>

<p>So, why does this happen? How is it more energetically favourable - or is it something else?</p>

<p>Also, are these explanations of why the ration changes for the other factors right:</p>

<ul>
<li>Temperature - equilibrium moves to the endothermic side of the reaction as temperature increases because the activation enthalpy of the exothermic reaction increases as the overall energy of the system is less </li>
<li>Concentration - ratio of products/reactants changes immediately after one part of the reaction's concentration increases, it then approaches the same ratio (assuming one whole side of the reaction is added)</li>
<li>Catalysts do nothing more than decrease the time it takes to reach equilibrium as they catalyse both sides of a reversible reaction and reduce the activation enthalpy</li>
</ul>

Racemic mixture vs enantiomers in drugs,"<p>a racemic mixture has 50-50% of the 2 different enantiomers. There are racemate drugs out there in the world. The misunderstanding I have is that usually 1 out of the 2 enantiomers molecules have a different reaction with the body, so if you perform racemisation to form a racemic mixture, ain’t that drug going to be still harmful in your body ? Or does FDA not accept racemic mixture where 1 of the enantiomers in it are harmful to the body? Thus they only accept racemic mixture where both enantiomers have to perform the same therapeutic effect on the body ?</p>

Validity of Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for solids,"<p>Suppose there is a solid made of avogadro number of, say, aluminium atoms. This solid is kept at 273 K. According to Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, all the particles or atoms will not have the same thermal energy. Some atoms are cooler than 273 K, some are much warmer than that etc. But is this true?</p>

<p>I mean, according to thermodynamics, heat must flow from warmer to cooler places (or particles) and must arrive at thermal equilibrium so that both places or particles will have same thermal energy or temperature.</p>

<p>So, atleast after some time, all the particles or atoms in a solid as I mentioned above must exchange energy with each other and must arrive at thermal equilibrium so that all the particles will have the same temperature (in the case I mentioned, 273 K), isn't it?

how can carbon dating even work? Its at atomic level!,"<p>I am a homeschooling parent, so pardon me asking stupid questions.
Everywhere I read, it is said carbon based lifeforms eat carbon and after their death that atom starts a decay. </p>

<p>But what I cannot understand, we dont eat or work with food at atomic levels. Yes, life forms breaks down molecules from food and use them as they wish. But that chemical process does not effect the atom structure. I dont think any life form has capacity or energy to break down atoms.</p>

<p>So if one atom of C14 was having a decay already before we ate it, it keeps having it while it gets digested and goes on in the same way if life is alive or dead. If another C14 was not having a decay, then it starting a decay has nothing to with the life form is alive or dead. </p>

<p>As Dr. Manhattan(Watchmen 2009) said atoms dont care if you are alive or dead. They stayed there at the same place before and after.</p>

<p>So how can a lifeform have any effect in the C14 decay at all?</p>

<p>How can we be sure that we have eaten only fresh out of factory C14? It may be already decayed by hundred or thousand of years  when we eat it. It applies to all living beings. If there is fresh C14 in the air, there is also decaying levels of C14 as old as 50K years.

C−H bond length in organic compounds,"<p>I am reading <em>Fundamental concepts of organic chemistry</em> by Dr. Anju Srivastava (12/04/2007).</p>

<p>It shows that carbon-hydrogen bond in ethane is 1.1 Å long, in ethene it's 1.08 Å,  and in ethyne it's 1.06 Å. According to the book, it's clear that carbon-hydrogen bond decreases with increasing multiple bonds on the carbon atom onto which the bond is!</p>

<p>According to my understanding, the shorter the covalent bond, the stronger it is, and it's contrary to the fact that the hydrogen atoms in ethylene are more acidic than those of ethene and so is ethane. The more acidic the hydrogen atom, the weaker it is held in a bond.</p>

Why are only two bond structures considered for ozone and not three?,"<p>We were taught in chemistry that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Formal charges can be determined by drawing the Lewis dot structure, then subtracting the nonbonding electrons and half of the bonding electrons from the number of electrons ordinarily in that atom's valence.</li>
<li>Molecules tend to be in the state with the lowest formal charge on the central atom; in the event that there are multiple such forms, it will take on an in-between state called a resonance hybrid.</li>
<li>Three-dimensionally there's VSEPR theory which determines molecular geometry. We haven't gotten to how to calculate more complex angles just yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider ozone. There are two resonance structures for it: <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{O-O=O}$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{O=O-O}$</span>, both of which have equivalent formal charges: <span class=""math-container"">$(1)$</span> on the central atom, and <span class=""math-container"">$(-1)$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$(0)$</span> on the axial atoms. This makes a resonance hybrid of <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{O\bond{~-}O\bond{~-}O}$</span>, with bond order <span class=""math-container"">$\frac32$</span> for each bond.</p>

<p>Why isn't a third structure accounted for? Consider ozone structured like a triangle, with a single bond attaching each oxygen to the other two, and four unbound electrons on each oxygen:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FI9Cb.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FI9Cb.png"" alt=""Triangular ozone""></a></p>

<ul>
<li>The formal charge for every oxygen would be <span class=""math-container"">$(0)$</span>.</li>
<li>The bond order would be <span class=""math-container"">$1$</span> for every bond; if merged as a resonance structure with the above two, it would create a structure with a bond order of <span class=""math-container"">$\frac43$</span> between the top oxygen and each side oxygen, and a bond order of <span class=""math-container"">$\frac13$</span> between the bottom two oxygens.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yet the empirical evidence supports a bond order of <span class=""math-container"">$\frac32$</span> as a bent molecule, not a bond order of <span class=""math-container"">$\frac43$</span> as a triangular molecule. Why not?</p>
",125039,12-12-2019 18:44,Can ozone have a triangular structure?,"<p>The structure of ozone is traditionally depicted using two resonance forms:</p>

Why aren't all bonds in cyclobutadiene not equal?,"<p>Cyclobutadiene is like benzene in that it has alternating single and double bonds in a ring. However, it's bonds are not the same length, the double bonds being shorter than single bonds. The molecule is rectangular, not square.</p>

<p>How would this be explained?
I have one plausible explanation that I tried to give...that is as follows</p>

<p>Cyclobutadiene is anti aromatic with 4n = 4 pi electrons, moreover it has huge strain in the molecule. To avoid such strain the molecule goes out of plane to compensate, but thus loses its ability to resonate. </p>

<p>Thus resonance structures like ones in benzene cannot be drawn for cyclobutadiene.</p>

Reconciling electron configuration and valence electron distribution over separate energy levels in energy band theory,"<p>The electron configuration of a Silicon atom in its ground state is <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{1s^2 2s^2 2p^2 3s^2 3p^2}$</span>, or equivalently, <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{[Ne] 3s^2 3p^2}$</span>.</p>

<p>When looking at the energy-level scheme of a silicon atom, the valence electrons are distributed over two separate energy levels; specifically, the <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{3s}$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{3p}$</span> energy levels. It is then said that, as you bring multiple Silicon atoms closer together, the two energy levels will split and overlap. And because the two energy levels are splitting and overlapping, they will produce two energy bands separated by a region of energy that is not allowed. Of these two energy bands, the lower energy band is referred to as the <strong>valence band</strong>, and the higher energy band is referred to as the <strong>conduction band</strong>.</p>

<p>I am familiar with the phenomena of valence and conduction bands, as well as the ""region of energy that is not allowed"", otherwise commonly referred to as the ""forbidden energy gap"".</p>

<p>However, I'm wondering what this phenomenon of the valence electrons being distributed over two separate energy levels is? How does one reconcile this with the electron configuration <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{1s^2 2s^2 2p^2 3s^2 3p^2}$</span>, which seems to suggest that the electrons remain in discrete, well-defined energy levels (rather than overlapping)?</p>

",83422,29-09-2017 23:55,Why is the water reduction of oxygen favored in acidic conditions?,"<p>The standard reduction potential of diatomic oxygen in acidic conditions is +1.23 volts. However, the standard reduction potential of diatomic oxygen in basic conditions is only +0.40 volts. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nc1vr.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Why is the reduction of diatomic oxygen by acidic media more favored than the reduction of oxygen by water that is basic? </p>

<p>I can think of a few reasons:</p>

<p>1) We are likely going to be forming negative two oxidation state oxygen anions when we oxidize diatomic oxygen. Oxygen adopts an oxidation state of negative two except in peroxides, which aren't very stable, and I don't think the oxygen radical will be very stable in solution. </p>

<p><strong>Can someone provide a less fluffy reason that we're going to be forming negative two oxidation state oxygen atoms?</strong> I'd imagine that the electronegativity and electron affinity of oxygen are two reasons it might favor the negative two oxidation state over the negative one oxidation state in solution. I.e. why doesn't this occur to a significant extent? </p>

<p>$\ce{O2 + 2e^- -&gt; 2O^-}$</p>

<p>Or this?</p>

<p>$\ce{O2 + 2e^- -&gt; HOOH}$</p>

<p>2) From the above we can deduce that water is the product; water is pretty stable in either acidic or basic medium - i.e. it won't react to a large extent with either hydronium or hydroxide ion. Plus the oxygen in water has a -2 oxidation state. So if we look at our skeleton half reaction:</p>

<p>$\ce{O2 + 4e^- -&gt; 2H2O}$</p>

<p>We realize that we need a source of protons. And the proton source in acidic medium is likely hydronium ion. </p>

<p>However, in basic medium, the proton source is water. I'd imagine that water is a poorer proton source than hydronium ion. </p>

<p>So would this account for the difference in standard reduction potential of oxygen in media that vary in pH? </p>

<p>I understand that voltage is an extension of K through the Nernst equation; is what I'm seeing here basically that the protonation of a base ($\ce{O^2-}$) is more favored in acidic rather than basic media? Could there also be kinetic factors? In other words, why is this statement true?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BPkFr.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Also: </p>

<p>1) What's the mechanism for the reduction of diatomic oxygen?</p>

<p>2) Why is the reduction of protons at high pH less favored than the reduction of protons at low pH? My first guess: you don't find as many protons in basic solutions. But then, protons don't exist by themselves anyway. So what can the proton source be? I'm guessing that in basic pH, there doesn't exist much hydronium ion. So the only two sources of protons are water and hydroxide anion. Heterolytically cleaving the hydroxide anion to form the highly basic oxide anion doesn't seem thermodynamically favorable. Cleaving water to form hydroxide anions ... are we running into a Le Chatlier's Principle effect? </p>

<p>ETA: Or should I be considering proton activities? Is the activity of the proton less in basic solution than in acidic solution? </p>

<p>Arguments in favour of the 2nd structure: </p>

<ol>
<li>Structure having filled octet for second row elements (C, N, O, F) are stable.</li>
<li>Structure having minimum number of formal charges and maximum number of bonds.</li>

</ol>

<p>Arguments supporting the first structure: </p>

<ol>
<li>Structure in which negative charge appears on the most electronegative atom should be chosen.</li>
<li>I feel that this <em>could</em> be more contributing because in the first structure sulphur has an expanded octet while $d$ orbitals are of higher energy so it's more favourable to form bonds without using them. </li>

But it doesn't, it forms five bonds, presumably using each of its five electrons. My first question is - why would it do this? It seems to me that this would result in the Phosphorus atom having ten electrons in its outer shell (four from the double bond with the oxygen and two each from the single bonds with the other three oxygens).</p>

<p>Apart from the oxygen with a double-bond, we have three oxygens forming single bonds. Does this not leave them one electron short?</p>

<p>I'm watching a video lecture by a professor of my college where he puts this question to the class. The class unanimously says <strong>B</strong>. At first I thought they were wrong, but then the professor agreed with them. </p>

<p>Is this true? The reason he gave was that oxygen's octet would be complete in <strong>B</strong>, hence it contributes more. But I don't understand this.</p>

<p>1) Isn't the octet complete in <strong>A</strong> too? It has 2 covalent bonds - <em>4 electrons (2 from sharing)</em> and 2 lone pairs. Adding up to 8.<br>
2) Oxygen being more electronegative than carbon, would pull the electrons towards itself, leading me to think that it would be more comfortable with a lone pair rather than another bond. Also, won't it prefer to lose out that '+' charge which the bonding's burdened onto it? </p>

<p>The presence of an extra bond in the canonical structure <strong>B</strong>, along with the completion of the carbon valency makes it more stable than <strong>A</strong>. The reaction with Br<span class=""math-container"">$^-$</span> is best explained looking at <strong>A</strong>, though, because the incoming nucleophile ends up bound to carbon, not oxygen.<br>

"So, is baking soda actually a strong base?","<p>Based on my recent thoughts, when baking soda ($\ce{NaHCO3}$) is dissolved in water, the following hydrolysis reaction occurs:
$$\ce{NaHCO3 + H2O &lt;=&gt; NaOH + H2CO3}$$
However,
$$\ce{H2CO3 -&gt; H2O + CO2 ^}$$
so the actual one is:
$$\ce{NaHCO3 -&gt; NaOH + CO2 ^}$$
$\ce{CO2}$ escapes, so the reaction is irreversible, all the $\ce{NaHCO3}$ is converted to $\ce{NaOH}$ and the product is a strong base.</p>

<p>The following reaction is possible:
$$\ce{HCO3- &lt;=&gt; H+ + CO3^2-}$$
but it's reversible unless it results in $\ce{H2CO3}$ formation, which is the same as the first one, so it doesn't really matter.</p>

<p>However, I was unable to find any evidence to that but a lot of discussions on whether $\ce{NaHCO3}$ behaves like a weak or a strong base, which put me in doubt. Am I right?</p>

<li>$\displaystyle\ce{NaHCO3 + H2O -&gt; Na+ + OH- + H2O + CO2}$, but that has water on both sides of the equation.</li>

"In C2 molecule, both bonds of the double bond are pi bonds. But isn't the rule that there should exist a sigma bond before a pi bond is formed?","<p>C2 molecules have been found in vapour state. Their double bonds are made of two pi bonds because four electrons need to be accomodated in each bond. So this is against the rule that there must be a sigma bond before a pi bond is formed in the double bond. Why the anomoly?</p>
",85223,03-11-2017 13:22,"Bonding in diatomic C2, a carbon-carbon quadruple bond?","<p>Carbon is well known to form single, double, and triple $\ce{C-C}$ bonds in compounds. There is a <a href=""http://metallome.blogspot.com/2012/02/carbon-carbon-quadruple-bond.html"">recent report</a> (2012) that carbon forms a quadruple bond in diatomic carbon, $\ce{C2}$. The excerpt below is taken from that report. The fourth bond seems pretty odd to me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$\ce{C2}$ and its isoelectronic molecules $\ce{CN+}$, BN and $\ce{CB-}$ (each having eight valence electrons) are bound by a quadruple bond. The bonding comprises not only one σ- and two π-bonds, but also one weak ‘inverted’ bond, which can be characterized by the interaction of electrons in two outwardly pointing sp hybrid orbitals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aHKMf.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to Shaik, the existence of the fourth bond in $\ce{C2}$ suggests that it is not really diradical...<br>
  If $\ce{C2}$ were a diradical it would immediately form higher clusters. I think the fact that you can isolate $\ce{C2}$ tells you it has a barrier, small as it may be, to prevent that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.chem1.com/acad/webtext/chembond/cb08.html"">Molecular orbital theory for dicarbon</a>, on the other hand, predicts a C-C double bond in $\ce{C2}$ with 2 pairs of electrons in $\pi$ bonding orbitals and a bond order of two. ""The bond dissociation energies (BDE) of $\ce{B2, C2}$, and $\ce{N2}$ show increasing BDE consistent with single, double, and triple bonds."" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_carbon"">Ref</a>) So this model of the $\ce{C2}$ molecule seems quite reasonable. </p>

<p>My questions, since this is most definitely not my area of expertise: </p>

<ul>
<li>Is dicarbon found naturally in any quantity and how stable is it? Is it easy to make in the lab? (The Wikipedia article reports it in stellar atmospheres, electric arcs, etc.)</li>
<li>Is there good evidence for the presence of a quadruple bond in $\ce{C2}$ that wouldn't be equally well explained by double bonding? </li>

Deviation in compressibility factor in different gases,"<p>Why does the compressibility factor of gases like Carbon Dioxide and Nitrogen first decrease then increase with increase in pressure , but for Hydrogen and Helium it only increases with the increase in pressure ? </p>

<p>In the above graph,the minima of the curve for methane is more than that of nitrogen. Also, for a given value of pressure, the value of $Z$ for methane is less than that of nitrogen. They seem to meet at high pressure. <strong>Why do some gases have lower value of Z?</strong></p>

<p>The same thing is observed if you compare methane and carbon dioxide. But they don't seem to meet at high pressure. This is because the $Z$ for methane increases at a faster rate. <strong>Why does Z increase faster for some gases?</strong></p>

<p>The real gas equation is $$\left(P+\frac{a}{V^2}\right)\left(V-b\right)=RT$$
I tried expressing $Z$ in terms of $P$ and $T$ by eliminating $V$.</p>

<p>$$V=\frac{ZRT}{P}$$
$$\left(P+\frac{aP^2}{Z^2R^2T^2}\right)\left(\frac{ZRT}{P}-b\right)=RT$$
$$ZRT-Pb+\frac{aP}{ZRT}-\frac{aP^2b}{Z^2R^2T^2}=RT$$
Multiplying by $Z^2$ on both sides,
$$Z^3RT-Z^2(Pb-RT)+\frac{ZaP}{RT}-\frac{aP^2b}{R^2T^2}=0$$
$$f(Z,P)=0$$

Why doesn't D block contraction affect the other P block groups 14 15 16 etc,"<p>Usually we come across anomalies in the trends of periodic properties for example the size <em>[Atomic radius value from Raymond Chang Chemistry 9th Edition]</em> of Gallium (135 pm) is smaller than Aluminium (143 pm) as opposed to the basic trend that atomic size increases down the group. This is usually attributed to the fact that the poor shielding of nuclear charge by intervening D orbitals leads to a greater $Z_\mathrm{eff}$ hence the radius is less as opposed to the trend.</p>

<p>If that's the reason why don't we observe similar effects for other groups like group 15 having Phosphorus (110 pm) and Arsenic (120 pm) <em>[Here the size doesn't increase much but is still significant as compared to changes taking place in group 13]</em> , where the size actually increases even when there are D orbitals to intervene. Or in short why are the effects so profound for group 13 and not the other members?</p>

",87827,25-12-2017 05:31,How are SN2 transition states stabilised by adjacent double bonds and carbonyl groups?,"<p>It is my understanding that transition states in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction have some filled and some empty orbital character, as we have the backside of the <strong>C-X σ*</strong> beginning to fill with electrons from the <strong>HOMO</strong> of the nucleophile, forming a <strong>C-Nu σ</strong> bond in the process.</p>

<p>If we have an adjacent carbonyl group to the <strong>α</strong> carbon, I have learnt that the TS is then only stabilised by the  <strong>C-O π*</strong>, i.e. by electron withdrawal and not by the <strong>C-O π</strong>.</p>

<p>However, with adjacent double bonds, I have learnt that the TS is stabilised by both the <strong>C-C π</strong> and the <strong>C-C π*</strong>. </p>

<p>I was wondering why this would be the case, as looking at the shape of the orbitals, there seems no reason that the <strong>C-O π</strong> could not align itself so that the partly-empty p orbital in the TS is parallel to the lobes of this MO, therefore stabilising the TS as new lower energy MOs form. </p>

<p>Also, with regard to the best representation of these structures, I always see partial negative charges on the Leaving group and the Nucleophile in the transition state, but never the positive charge located on the <strong>α</strong> carbon. Surely if with adjacent carbonyl groups we only have stabilisation by electron withdrawal, it is valid to put the partial positive charge there?</p>

Degree of hydrolysis,"<p>A book which I am reading has this topic on hydrolysis of salts.<br>
Suppose $\ce{NH4Cl}$ is dissolved in water. It is a salt of a strong acid and a weak base. $\ce{NH4+}$ ions being the conjugate acid of a weak base is strong and reacts with $\ce{H2O}$ to give $\ce{H+}$ thus making the solution acidic.
$$\ce{NH4+ + H2O &lt;=&gt; NH4OH + H+}$$
Now for calculating degree of hydrolysis $h$ it takes the initial concentration to be $C$. This means $C(1-h)$ of $\ce{NH4+}$ remains and $Ch$ each of $\ce{NH4OH}$ and  $\ce{H^+}$ is formed. Therefore, $K_h = \frac{Ch^2}{1-h}$. In the next step $1-h$ has been approximated as $1$. While calculating degree of dissociation of weak electrolyte we do a similar thing but that is because degree of dissociation is too small compared to 1 but here, I cannot understand how can degree of hydrolysis be very small compared to 1 when $\ce{NH4+}$ is a strong acid.</p>

But, my teacher and also I am convinced that trans-but-2-ene is more stable than 2-methylpropene.

Also, 2-methylpropene is more reactive for the electrophilic addition reactions involving carbocation intermediate as a 3° carbocation will form and in case of trans-but-2-ene, a 2° carbocation is formed.

Do atoms in a molecule actually keep rotating freely in case they have sigma bond?,"<p>While reading about cis-trans isomers I found the concept of free rotation of atoms.it says 2 atoms connected by sigma bond do not have trans sis isomer because of free rotation.while in case of pi bond free rotation is not possible. My question is : do we mean actual rotation of atoms in molecule when we say free rotation? Does the rotation happen spontaneously? What things are responsible for the rotation? Or is it just a concept to understand the concept of cis-trans isomers?</p>
",86987,07-12-2017 16:32,When can a molecule be considered freely rotating at room temperature?,"<p>This question sparked from a long discussion in chat about the nature of $\ce{H2O2}$ and whether that molecule can be considered to rotate around the $\ce{O-O}$ axis (and hence display axial chirality) or not.</p>

<p>Considering two rather clear cases:<br>
Ethane is considered to rotate freely around the $\ce{C-C}$ bond. The activation energy for rotation (equivalent to the energy difference between the staggered and eclipsed conformations) is given as $12.5\,\mathrm{\frac{kJ}{mol}}$.</p>

<p>Ethene on the other hand is considered to not freely rotate around the $\ce{C=C}$ bond. The energy difference between the planar and perpendicular conformations (the rotation barrier) is given at $250\,\mathrm{\frac{kJ}{mol}}$. (I am unsure of this value which I found on Yahoo answers. If I understand correctly, this should correspond with the excitation from $\unicode[Times]{x3C0}$ to $\unicode[Times]{x3C0}^*$ which I found elsewhere as $743\,\mathrm{\frac{kJ}{mol}}$.)</p>

<p>Somewhere between these two extreme cases must lie some kind of barrier around which rotation is severely hindered to entirely inhibited.</p>

<hr>

<p>Attempting to calculate this myself, I remembered the Boltzmann distribution: If two states differ in energy by $\Delta E$, their relative populations $F_1$ and $F_2$ can be calculated as follows:</p>

<p>$$\frac{F_2}{F_1} = \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{\Delta E}{k_{\mathrm{B}} T}}$$</p>

<p>($F_2$ being the higher energy state and $k_\mathrm{B}$ being the Boltzmann constant.)</p>

<p>If I calculate relative populations from the energy differences $12.5, 19, 25$ and $250\,\mathrm{\frac{kJ}{mol}}$ for ethane, butane, $\ce{H2O2}$ and ethene, respectively (which correspond to $0.13, 0.20, 0.26$ and $2.6\,\mathrm{\frac{eV}{particle}}$) I get the following results at $300\,\mathrm{K}$:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ethane: $6.55 \times 10^{-3}$</li>
<li>Butane: $4.79 \times 10^{-4}$</li>
<li>$\ce{H2O2}$: $4.29 \times 10^{-5}$</li>
<li>Ethene: $2.09 \times 10^{-44}$</li>
</ul>

<p>Or logarithmic (ln) values of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ethane: $5.03$</li>
<li>Butane: $7.64$</li>
<li>$\ce{H2O2}$: $10.1$</li>
<li>Ethene: $101$</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, somewhere between butane and ethene must be a threshold-ish value, above which free rotation at $300\,\mathrm{K}$ cannot be considered, but what range are we looking at; similar to what energy difference does this correspond to?</p>

<p>Asked the other way round, if I have an energy barrier of $25\,\mathrm{\frac{kJ}{mol}}$, what would I need to put on into the equation to calculate the temperature above which free rotation can be assumed?</p>

Why is formic acid more acidic than benzoic acid?,"<p><strong>Why is formic acid(pKa=3.751)  more acidic than benzoic acid(pKa=4.204)?</strong> </p>

<p>Here's what I understand:</p>

<p>1) Phenyl ring is electron withdrawing therefore it should decrease electron density on oxygen thus stabilizing the anion obtained after deprotonation. Considering this argument, benzoic acid should be more acidic than formic acid. </p>

<p>2) <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/anAEj.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/anAEj.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>It looks like resonance of phenyl ring with carboxylate should destabilize the anion and therefore, formic acid should be a better acid. But the ""aromatic ring is so thermodynamically stable that the phenyl ring donating electrons to the carboxylate is not a major resonance structure"". </p>

<p>Considering the two above factors, benzoic acid should be stronger than formic acid. Then why it's not? </p>
",87053,08-12-2017 18:24,Comparing acidities of substituted and aromatic carboxylic acids,"<p>When comparing the acidities of carboxylic acids, we primarily see the electropositivity of the carboxylic acid carbons, i.e. we see how effectively the negative charge on the carboxylate ion is dispersed upon ionization.

<p>Now consider the following two comparisons:-   </p>

<blockquote>

<p>My questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Why is 3-chloropropanoic acid less acidic than formic acid. The negative inductive effect of chlorine helps in dispersing the negative charge on the carboxylate ion. It is not conjugated and too far to exert positive mesomeric effect. Therefore, the negative inductive effect should increase the acidity by improving the stability of the conjugate base.</p></li>
  <li><p>Why is benzoic acid weaker than formic acid? Unless I am mistaken, in several other places, the phenylic moiety is treated as slightly electron withdrawing, as in case of alcohol acidity, acidity of hydrogens in base catalysed reactions etc. I am unable to understand the resonance here or any other factor, that might cause this anomaly.</p></li>

I would think that the electromagnetic waves would interact with the transient electric and magnetic fields within the molecule itself as it propagates and therefore the light changes direction as it passes through the molecule. However with this idea there seems to be a problem with the fact that all the molecules wouldn't be oriented in the same directions and thus scatter the light in all directions rather than a net rotation in one direction of the light. I am looking for an explanation using electromagnetism if it can be explained at that level or if it cannot, the quantum mechanical answer would be fine as well. </p>

<p><strong>Case 2</strong>, using only SIP effect<br>
If we consider that methyl's bulkiness shields the lone pair of nitrogen from protonation in o-toluidine and no such inhibition or shielding happens in aniline, we can conclude that aniline is more basic than o-toluidine.</p>

Can rate constant for forward reaction be equal to rate constant for backward reaction?,"<p>For a particular reaction, can we have
<span class=""math-container"">$K_c = 1$</span>?</p>

<p>My confusion arised when I was studying the effect of temperature on <span class=""math-container"">$K_c$</span> . I see that the temperature must affect forward and backward rate constants, differently for a reaction so that it changes <span class=""math-container"">$K_c$</span> (which is ratio of the two rate constants). So I thought for a reaction with <span class=""math-container"">$K_c$</span> equal to one, both the rates must be equal, so both will get equally affected by temperature, and thus no change in <span class=""math-container"">$K_c$</span> , or does it have something to do with the Arrhenius equation?</p>

<p>I know that there is a lot of lacking in my intuition as I have just began studying Le Chatelier's principle and all the stuff. So a detailed explanation would be much welcome.</p>

Is cis- or trans-cycloundecene more stable?,"<p>While reading about cis/trans isomerism in cycloalkenes, I came across the following statement:  </p>

<p>When the number of carbon atoms in a cycloalkane is less than 11, the cis form is more stable than the trans form. When it is greater than 11, the trans form is more stable than the cis form.</p>

<p>An obvious question came to my mind: What if the number of carbon atoms in the ring is ""equal"" to 11? Which form will be more stable - cis or trans? I think both will be of the same stability, but would like to have some clarification in this regard.</p>

<p>I searched my books and didn't find any specifications on the stability of cis or trans forms, for a ring containing exactly 11 carbon atoms. I read the answers to the question <em><a href=""https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/q/20375/81509"">Stability of cis vs trans isomers?</a></em> but they discuss only the cases ""less than 11"" and ""greater than 11"" but not ""equal to 11"".</p>

Temperature in Le Chatelier's principle,"<p>Suppose I have a reversible reaction and the forward reaction is endothermic.

<p>According to Le Chatelier's Principle, if I increase the temperature of a system (where the forward reaction is endothermic), equilibrium will be shifted to the right.</p>

<p>Can someone please illustrate this or bring some sort of diagram with some values to justify this?. It would help a lot if an answer could help me why should I discard the second option?. </p>

<p>Please explain me in easier to understand terms with out monster equations.</p>
",128483,29-02-2020 18:39,What actually is the Wavefunction?,"<p>I am aware that the square of the Wavefunction gives the probability density of finding an electron at a particular point in space. I have also heard that it's a complex number but since it's a function I am unsure as to how that could be the case (perhaps someone could please clear that up for me as a sub-question). Moreover, I have seen it described as the amplitude of something but I literally have no idea what is meant by that. However, the crux of the question is what is the Wavefunction itself (i.e not what the square of it is). I have read in the book ""Why Chemical Reactions Happen"" that it is essentially synonymous with the word/concept: orbital. I have also seen in various places w(x,y,x) or w(r,theta,thi) [where ""w"" represents the sign for a wavefunction] so, from what I can gather it is a function in three dimensions that represents the shape of a particular orbital where the function of (x,y,z) or (r,theta,thi) would, of course, be different for the s,p,d and f orbitals. However, in the book ""Why Chemical Reactions Happen"" it goes onto say that wavefunctions of different atoms <strong>interfere</strong> with each other to form molecular orbitals and the atomic orbitals somehow have a phase?! For my idea of a wavefunction to be correct, the idea of interference of these wavefunctions must be an idea that was thought of to try and rationalize the process of the formation of molecular bonding and anti-bonding orbitals from atomic ones to make it easier to understand and conceptualize. If I am right about the wavefunction being a purely mathematical representation of the space where an electron is likely to reside then the molecular wavefunctions are just as curious in terms of their shape and suchlike as the shapes of the atomic orbitals they came from (i.e nobody really knows <strong>why</strong> they are that shape but when atoms or molecules are arranged in a particular way, orbitals ""just are"" that shape). Also the idea of phase seemed to bring my argument down but then I thought that perhaps phase is simply defined as being opposite relative to another part of an orbital if it is the other side of an angular node (I suspect this is wrong but could someone please shed some light on this?)</p>

<p>Going back to when I said - ""the molecular wavefunctions are just as curious in terms of their shape and suchlike as the shapes of the atomic orbitals they came from"" - I thought this because I found it bizarre that empty orbitals could ""interfere"" with an orbital from another atom. For example one p orbital is empty yet all three interact with the four hydrogen s orbitals. Unless, the electrons can jump between the the degenerate p orbitals at such a frequency that all can be considered occupied I find it incomprehensible that just a portion of space can interfere with an orbital. As a result, I came to the conclusion that I quoted at the start of the paragraph. Basically meaning that when atoms come together to form molecules the electrons find the lowest possible energy spaces to reside; or in other words, a molecuar orbital / molecular wavefunction forms which is equally as curious as the atomic wavefunctions with their strange shapes.</p>

<p>Any help with this concept would be greatly appreciated - I am off to Oxford university this October and Molecular Orbital Theory is a small part of the suggested reading list before arrival into the first year.

Multiple bonds solely with sp3 hybridised orbitals?,"<p>I have fond that similar question has been asked already (<a href=""https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/78767/why-dont-carbons-use-sp3-instead-of-sp2-orbitals-to-make-double-bonds"">why don&#39;t carbons use sp3 instead of sp2 orbitals to make double bonds?</a>), but I don't think it was formulated in a manner that was touching the concept I am interested in.</p>

<p>I would like to know is it reasonable to consider double and triple bonds as result of overlapping solely sp3 hybridised orbitals. I imagine that alternative view on carbon-carbon double bond in ethene could be that two pairs of sp3 hybridised orbitals from each carbon overlap - giving four molecular orbitals, two of which would be bonding and fully occupied while other two would be empty. Moreover, geometry of such constructed double bond would be correct as all four hydrogen atoms bonded by remaining four sp3 orbitals from the two carbons would be coplanar (together with these two carbon atoms as well) and length of the bond would also be shorter than for single bond. I believe that similar case could be made for carbon-carbon triple bond. </p>

<p>Below I am presenting you a simple figure I have made to graphically demonstrate the idea.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/U0EzI.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/U0EzI.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I do recall seeing this concept is some textbook being presented as legitimate thing, I do not remember where it was, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Could you please explain it to me if this concept is reasonable idea, and if not - then why not? It would also be great to know how does energetic levels in such instance compare to the system with multiple bonds created by overlaps including hybridised and nonhybridized orbitals. (The one thing that appears in my mind is that in commonly accepted version of multiple bonds there is sigma bond that has electron density directly between nuclei making this arrangement more favourable. However, there are systems like two electron three centre bonds, as in B2H6, in which three centres are hold in similar arrangement to discussed above)</p>
",128511,01-03-2020 14:03,What utility does the Tau bond model of orbital overlap have?,"<p>In his book on molecular orbital theory, <em>Molecular Orbitals and Organic Chemical Reactions</em>, Ian Fleming notes that Pauling formulated an early alternative model to Huckel theory for explaining the bonding of simple conjugated polyenes. Evidently, this came to be called $\tau$-bonding. Fleming describes it as a modification to, or offshoot from, the hybridization model, in which orbitals similar to sp3 hybridized orbitals are combined. Fleming says that the $\tau$-bond model makes the extent of the conjugation less obvious, but that the model</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] might have some virtues, not present in the Huckel model, especially in trying to explain some aspects of stereochemistry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is $\tau$-bonding just the historical precursor to the bent/banana-bond model, or does it have some unique independent significance that makes it directly relevant to modern chemists?</li>
<li>What are the specific ""virtues"" that Fleming might have been referring to, and what, if any, advantages does the $\tau$-bond model have over Huckel theory and/or other approaches grounded in MO theory?</li>

<p>However, during my lectures, my professor said that there is no such change in the trend: the larger atoms such as $\ce{I-}$ will always be more nucleophilic than $\ce{F-}$ due to the fact that it is more polarizable and likely to donate an electron pair.

",131169,05-04-2020 11:16,"Prove that a 10-Degree Temperature Increase Doubles the Rate Constant (k), when the Activation Energy is Approximately 50 kJ/mol","<p>I read that increasing the temperature by $10~^\circ\mathrm C$ will double the rate constant ($k$), when the activation energy for the reaction is relatively close to $50~\mathrm{kJ/mol}$.</p>

<p>However, no matter how hard I try to wrap my head around it (through graphical examples that require plotting the natural logarithm of $k$ vs the inverse of temperature), I just can't grasp this so called ""rule of thumb"". </p>

<p>As a result, I tried proving this statement through mathematical expressions:</p>

<p>(Note that the activation energy was evaluated for $50\,000$ because it needs to be expressed in $\mathrm{J/mol}$ to be used in Arrhenius' equation)</p>

<p><em>Prove that...</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A rise of temperature of $10\ \mathrm{^\circ C}$ will double the rate constant, when the activation energy for the reaction is approximately $50\ \mathrm{kJ/mol}$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Proof starts here -----------------------------</strong></p>

<p><em>For:</em>  $\Delta T = T_2 - T_1$ ($T_2$ is the final temperature, and $T_1$ the initial temperature)</p>

<p><em>When:</em> $\Delta T = 10 \rightarrow T_2 - T_1 = 10$</p>

<p><em>It follows that:</em> The ratio between $k_2$ (at $T_2$) and $k_1$ (at $T_1$) will equal $2$, owing to the doubling of the rate constant ($k$):</p>

<p>$$
{k_2\over k_1} = 2
$$</p>

<p><em>Employing Arrhenius' equation:</em></p>

<p>$$
{k_2\over k_1} = {A\mathrm e^{\left({-E_\mathrm a\over RT_2}\right)}\over A\mathrm e^{\left({-E_\mathrm a\over RT_1}\right)}}
       = \mathrm e^{\left[{-E_\mathrm a\over R}\left({1\over T_2} – {1\over T_1}\right)\right]}
       = 2
$$</p>

<p><em>Or simply:</em></p>

<p>$$
{k_2\over k_1} = \exp{\!\left({-E_\mathrm a\over R} \cdot \Delta{1\over T} \right)} = 2
$$</p>

<p><em>So:</em></p>

<p>$$
\exp{\!\left({-E_\mathrm a\over R} \cdot \Delta{1\over T} \right)} = 2
$$</p>

<p><strong>This might be the part where I messed up -------------------------</strong></p>

<p>$\Delta{1\over T}$ can be set in terms of $\Delta T$:</p>

<p>$$
\Delta{1\over T} = \left({1\over T_2}-{1\over T_1}\right)
       = \left({T_1\over T_1T_2}-{T_2\over T_1T_2}\right)
       = \left({T_1-T_2\over T_1T_2}\right)
       = \left({-\Delta T\over T_1T_2}\right)
$$</p>

<p>Since Arrhenius' equation above holds true for $\Delta T = 10$ ...</p>

<p>And since $\Delta{1\over T}$ can be expressed as $-\Delta T \over T_1T_2$ ...</p>

<p>Then, the rate constant ($k$) will double when:</p>

<p>$$
\Delta{1\over T} = {-10\over T_1T_2}
$$</p>

<p>Substituting into Arrhenius' equation:</p>

<p>$$
\exp{\!\left({-E_\mathrm a\over R}\cdot{-10\over T_1T_2}\right)} = 2
$$</p>

<p>Simplifying:</p>

<p>$$
\begin{align}
\exp{\left({10E_\mathrm a\over RT_1T_2}\right)} &amp;= 2 \\
{10E_\mathrm a\over RT_1T_2} &amp;= \ln{2} \\
{1\over T_1 T_2} &amp;= {R\cdot\ln{2}\over 10E_\mathrm a} \\
T_1 T_2 &amp;= {10E_\mathrm a\over R\cdot\ln{2}}
\end{align}
$$</p>

<p>From $T_2 - T_1 = 10$ we can solve for $T_2$ as $T_2 = T_1 + 10$. Substituting above:</p>

<p>$$
\begin{align}
T_1 (T_1 + 10) &amp;= {10E_\mathrm a\over R\cdot\ln{2}} \\
T_1^2 + 10T_1 - {10E_\mathrm a\over R\cdot\ln{2}} &amp;= 0
\end{align}
$$</p>

<p>For $E_\mathrm a = 50\,000$:</p>

<p>$$
T_1^2 + 10T_1 - {500\,000\over R\cdot\ln{2}} = 0
$$</p>

<p>Solving the quadratic equation:</p>

<p>$$
\begin{align}
T_1 &amp;= 290~\mathrm K \\
T_2 &amp;= 300~\mathrm K \\
\Delta T &amp;= 10~\mathrm K
\end{align}
$$</p>

<p>I don't think this proof is correct because substituting any value for activation energy ($E_\mathrm a$) onto the quadratic equation will produce different values for $T_1$, but that doesn't tell me anything.</p>

Can this be proved any other way? </p>

<p>This explains CHCl3>CCl4.</p>

  <p>Again, in case of CHCl3, the three C-Cl bonds point to one side, so a moment equal to C-Cl bond is generated as a result. A moment of C-H bond is added to it. In CH2Cl2, the moment of two C-Cl bond is added at $\ce{109^\circ}$(approx.) so the resultant is greater than on C-Cl bond.</p>

<p>Let us consider $\ce{C-Cl}$ bond moment to be $x$ and that of $\ce{C-H}$ bond to be $y$.    </p>

<p>In $\ce{CCl4}$, the dipole moment of any three $\ce{C-Cl}$ atoms is balanced by the dipole moment of the fourth $\ce{C-Cl}$ bond dipole moment. This means the resultant of dipole moment of three $\ce{C-Cl}$ bonds in tetrahedral structure is equal to $x$, which is equal and opposite to the dipole moment $x$ of the fourth $\ce{C-Cl}$ bond.   </p>

<p>Now, when we replace one of the chlorines with a hydrogen, the net dipole moment equals $x+y$, (as they are in the same directions). Similarly if we carry out the same procedure for $\ce{CH3Cl}$ it can be proved that its dipole moment is also $x+y$.    </p>

What is the substance turning salty water green when electrolysed?,"<p>I am a student and I take O.L. Chemistry, in my knowledge I know if I electrolysed concentrated aqueous NaCl solution I should get Hydrogen evolved at the cathode and chlorine at the anode.</p>

<p>I did an experiment, I add a lot of table slat to tap water to get the electrolyte ready (aq. NaCl) then I used graphite electrodes (just got it from a mechanical pencil) and passed electricity through the salty water. I used of course direct current using a 6 Volts battery I got.</p>

<p>Well my suggestions were half correct, Hydrogen really evolved and bubbled violently at the cathode, but at anode I didn't see any yellowish green gas indicating presence of chlorine, yet only colorless bubbles continue to evolve from the anode but was less violently than the cathode. I thought this is Oxygen evolving so I increased the concentration of solution by adding table salt but also only colorless bubbles evolves at the anode. Well I didn't really calculated how much precisely I should add salt but I added insanely a lot of table salt.</p>

<p>Only to discover after around 5 minutes of electrolyzing the salty water, it became darkish green in color, I didn't really knew what is this and this is my question, I used graphite electrodes so those doesn't react like if I used iron, the solution was just nice tap water and not really bad or muddy. My only suggestion is that this is actually chlorine dissolved in water ... So is this correct ?? I knew that chlorine is soulable in water but I didn't thought it will turn the whole water greenish in color....</p>

Why are the stoichiometric coefficients used as exponents in the chemical equilibrium constant?,"<p>From what I can ascertain, the formulation of the chemical equilibrium constant is somewhat arbitrary. I don't understand the motivation for putting the stoichiometric coefficients in the exponents. This seems like you are double counting. For instance, if A ->  4B, for every mole of A that decomposes to B produces 4 moles of B. So my reaction would already have a higher amount of B. Then I take those four moles and raise to the 4th power. So if I started with 2 moles of A and 1 decomposed, I would have one mole of A to 4 moles of B. Then I would have a equilibrium constant of 256. How is this superior to not having exponents and just having an equilibrium constant of 4? Or for that matter there are many arbitrary ways I can stick on or not the stoichiometric coefficients. Why not take the 4th root of B over the first root of A?</p>

<p>Edit: Many are saying that this is a duplicate of Law of Mass Action. However, in that question the stoichiometric coefficients just HAPPENED to be the exponents. And as pointed out in the answer the order in the rate law doesn't have to be the same as them. My question is dealing with the Eqilibrium Constant. The Equipibrium Constant is defined such that the stoichiometric coefficients are ALWAYS the exponents. Why?</p>

Will Calcium Carbonate react with Sodium Chloride?,"<p>After reading through my school chemistry notes and the answer to the question here at Chem S.E of how do we know whether an $\ce{A + B}$ reaction will occur, I find myself stuck on this very basic question. 
I understand that $\ce{CaCO3 + HCl}$ will react as it is an acid + base reaction and that the reverse reaction $\ce{Na2CO3 + CaCl2}$ to $\ce{CaCO3}$ and $\ce{HCl}$ is possible. 
I don't think I can use bond enthalpy to figure out if the reaction is spontaneous or non-spontaneous, because the reactants and products are ionic rather than molecular compounds. 
I believe that I might need to use some sort of enthalpy calculation to figure this reaction out, but I'm not sure which specific one in particular. 
On a whim, I believe that this reaction will not occur but I'm still very uncertain.</p>

<p>Is there a way that I could have predicted this reaction (and any other) before I learned about it? I do not want to memorize the outcome of every combination o that I can answer questions about chemical reactions. I am hoping there is a short list of simple rules that govern all chemical reactions that I can commit to memory and then apply to any combination of substances. I might also like to be able to develop a simple computer program built around an algorithm for these reactivity rules that can sample databases of known substances and predict new reactions.</p>

Methanol vs water. Acidic strength,"<p>Why <span class=""math-container"">$CH_3OH$</span> is more acidic than <span class=""math-container"">$H_2O$</span> while the same is opposite for other alcohols?</p>
",108528,25-01-2019 09:23,Is methanol more acidic than water?,"<p>Methanol is slightly more acidic than water. Their $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a}$ values, in water, are $15.5$ and $15.7$, respectively. All other aliphatic alcohols, however, are less acidic than water. </p>

<p>Is the following reasoning correct? This is my best rationalization; is there anything better or anything that can be added? </p>

<p>In both hydroxide and methoxide, we have an $\ce{O}$ bearing negative charge. In the former, we have a hydrogen attached to the $\ce{O}$. In the latter, we have a carbon attached to the $\ce{O}$. Carbon is more electronegative than hydrogen, therefore, carbon should be able to better withdraw electron density via induction from the $\ce{O}$. This is a stabilizing interaction.</p>

<p>We often think of methyl groups as inductively donating, but that's molecular profiling. They can inductively donate to a carbocation, partly because a carbocation is highly electronegative, so the carbocation pulls the electrons toward itself pretty well (so there's both pushing and pulling of electrons going on). When you have a methyl group attached to an $\ce{O}$, however, the methyl group is often inductively withdrawing. NMR data supports this.</p>

<p>Now the question is why aren't other aliphatic alcohols more acidic than water? In longer-chain aliphatic alkoxides, you don't just have a methyl group attached to the $\ce{O}$ bearing the negative charge - you have a bunch of methyl groups strung together. These lessen the amount of inductive withdrawal that the alpha carbon can do. Each$\ce{-CH2 -}$ unit attached to the alpha $\ce{-CH2 -}$ is somewhat inductive donating to the alpha $\ce{-CH2 -}$.</p>

<p>However, at very low concentrations, this method doesn't work out so well, because water has an amount of auto-ionization, which is described by $K_\mathrm{w} = 10^{-14}$. My old method was just to say that</p>

<p>Now as I remember it, divers take care not to surface <em>too</em> quickly because it results in '<em>the Bends</em>', which involves the formation of nitrogen bubbles in the blood and is potentially fatal.</p>

<p>If that's the case, why not use <em>pure</em> oxygen gas in SCUBA tanks? It seems like a good idea since it would </p>

<ul>
<li><p>a) Enable divers to stay underwater for longer periods of time (I keep hearing that ordinary SCUBA tanks only give divers a pathetic <em>hour</em> or so of time underwater.</p></li>
<li><p>b) Possibly eliminate the chances of developing '<em>the Bends</em>' upon surfacing. Well, it seems plausible, that is if the diver were to take a 10 minute deep-breathing session with pure oxygen to flush out whatever nitrogen's there in his lungs <em>before</em> hooking up a cylinder of pure oxygen and going for a dive. So if there's no gaseous nitrogen in his lungs and blood, then he wouldn't have to worry about <em>nitrogen</em> bubbles developing in his system.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now those two possible advantages aren't hard to overlook, but since no one fills SCUBA tanks with pure oxygen, there must be <em>some</em> reason that <em>I've</em> overlooked, that discourages divers from filling the tanks with pure oxygen. So what is it?</p>

<p>Also, I hear that the oxygen cylinders used in hospitals have very high concentrations of oxygen; heck, there's one method of treatment called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine#Oxygen_supply"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT)</a> where they give patients 100% pure oxygen at <em>elevated</em> pressures.</p>

<p>Hence I doubt whether the increase in <em>pressure</em> associated with diving is the problem here. So I reiterate: </p>

<p><strong>Why is it a bad idea for divers to breathe pure oxygen underwater?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>I guess most of the recent answers have kinda missed a main point, so I'll rephrase the question:</p>

<p><strong>Why is it a bad idea for divers to breathe pure oxygen underwater? If it is indeed due to pressure considerations as most sources claim, then why doesn't it seem to be a problem when patients are given 100% pure oxygen in cases like the HBOT (which is performed at elevated pressures) ?</strong></p>

Exceptionally weak basicity of pyridine,"<p>It is often explained that the relatively lower basicity of pyridine, relative to most amines, is due to the fact that the <span class=""math-container"">$\ce {N}$</span> lone pair resides in an <span class=""math-container"">$\ce {sp^2}$</span> hybridised orbital, instead of an <span class=""math-container"">$\ce {sp^3}$</span> hybridised orbital. the higher s character of the lone pair-bearing orbital thus holds on to the electron pair more tightly as the lone pair experiences more of the nuclear charge, decreasing the availability of the lone pair for donation to an acid. </p>

<p>Consider the data provided by Clayden, Warren &amp; Greeves (2012), on p. 726. Yes, we observe the lower basicity of pyridine, relative to piperidine. This is consistent with the above rationalisation.

Why does delocalization lead to stability?,"<p>If the electrons are relatively more stable when they are delocalized than when they are localized between two atoms, then why do we have bonds formed in the first place? Forming of bonds between two atoms means that electrons localized between the two atoms, if electrons tend to delocalize then why not all electrons (including the sigma bond electrons) are just delocalized? What is the driving force for delocalisation ? How does delocalisation the energy of the system?</p>

<p>On research, I've seen an explanation that it does not because the concentration of both reactants and products decrease evenly, but I don't understand this. The side with more moles should have a greater decrease in concentration because the concentration is proportional to the number of moles. Also, by the same argument, decreasing volume in a gaseous reaction should not shift equilibrium. </p>

"How to deal with the unit ""Coulomb per equivalent""?","<p>In a question that I came across they defined <span class=""math-container"">$1\,\pu{F}$</span> as 96500 coulomb per equivalent. Now as far as my knowledge is concerned <span class=""math-container"">$1\,\pu{F} = 96500\,\pu{C/mol}$</span>. The question involved asks to calculate the current that needs to be passed (or may be a function of that) wherein I mistook the <span class=""math-container"">$n$</span> factor and the answer was just half of what it was supposed to be. However that taking <span class=""math-container"">$1\,\pu{F}$</span> as ""coulomb per equivalent"" would lead me to a antoher unit (equivalent per mole) in order to get the desired unit in the question.</p>

<p>In this context I would like to:</p>

<p>a)  Get an intuitive explanation into the number of equivalents (just like moles is Avogadro number of substances).</p>

<p>b)  Know what the unit ""equivalents/mole"" means (is it the same thing as <span class=""math-container"">$n$</span> factor?) How does the <span class=""math-container"">$n$</span> factor treat number of moles and equivalents so differently?</p>

Meaning of chemical energy,"<p>I am trying to understand the meaning of chemical energy.
I saw in my book that chemical energy is stored in the bonds of chemical compounds and when the bonds are untied the chemical energy increases.</p>

<p>I don't understand, shouldn't the chemical energy decreases? I think this because the chemical energy is not stored anymore (because there are no bonds)</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lgePk.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lgePk.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>This page describes the chemical energy level.</p>
",129547,25-03-2020 15:59,How is chemical energy stored in carbon,"<p>I'm fairly new to chemistry, and I have a hard time understanding how chemical energy is stored in carbon (I'm aware that the question can be generalised to 'how is chemical energy stored', but I'm trying to understand it in the example of carbon). In the example in my book, carbon and oxygen react to form carbon dioxide, releasing energy in the form of warmth in the process.</p>

<p>My book says that the energy released in this process mainly comes from carbon, which is originally the solar energy stored by plants. I have to tried to look for explanations <em>how</em> that energy is stored (not how the process of photosynthesis works, but in what form or what is the meaning of the 'stored energy'), but I still can't really wrap my head around it. The best answer so far was <a href=""https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/3947/what-is-the-nature-of-chemical-energy"">What is the nature of chemical energy?</a></p>

<p>If I understand the answer there correctly, the bond potential energy of a carbon dioxide molecule is lower than the combined bond potential energy of a carbon atom and an oxygen molecule. Given that, there are still two things I don't understand:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why is the bond potential energy in the carbon atom and/or oxygen molecule higher than that of a dioxide molecule? How can that explained? Is this directly related to the chemical traits of the elements carbon and oxygen and the compound carbon dioxide?</li>
<li>Why, or better said how is said bond potential energy converted to warmth in the process?</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm aware that there might be concepts in physics here I don't know or understand to understand a possible answer, and I would be thankful for any pointers to what subjects I should be first reading to understand such an answer.</p>

<p>Edit: I would like to quote here something I came across on wikipedia. I'm not providing it as an answer nor claiming it is correct, just trying to illustrate how <em>confusing</em> it is to find a satisfying answer for this matter. This comes from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond#Overview_of_main_types_of_chemical_bonds"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond#Overview_of_main_types_of_chemical_bonds</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the simplest view of a covalent bond, one or more electrons (often a pair of electrons) are drawn into the space between the two atomic nuclei. Energy is released by bond formation. This is not as a reduction in potential energy <em>(sic)</em>, because the attraction of the two electrons to the two protons is offset by the electron-electron and proton-proton repulsions. Instead, the release of energy (and hence stability of the bond) arises from the <strong>reduction in kinetic energy</strong> due to the electrons being in a more spatially distributed (i.e. longer de Broglie wavelength) orbital compared with each electron being confined closer to its respective nucleus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Italic and bold added by me. Note that wikipedia itself has a '[clarification needed]' tagging in the middle of that text, right after 'two protons', which I removed.</p>

<p>So if I understand <em>that</em> correctly and assuming that info is correct, any formation of a covalent bond would result in energy being released. But that still doesn't explain why my book is claiming the energy is particularly stored in carbon (and not in oxygen), and why it is released as warmth. In addition, the explanation on wikipedia would contradict what I referred to earlier, namely that the energy released comes from differences in bond potential energy.</p>

Does ethanol conduct electricity?,"<p>I am trying to find out about methylated spirts/denatured alcohol. As far as I can fine, methylated spirits is roughly 95% ethanol. Will it conduct electricity?</p>

<p>I have done some research, but I have not found much of anything. <a href=""https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-calculate-the-pKa-value-of-ethanol"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This reference</a> discusses ethanol's pKa value (15.9, no source for value). I am aware that the reason why pure water conducts is because it dissociates into ions. Additionally, acid dissociation is written about on Wikipedia, but it always involves two reagents (something and water) - except for water self-ionization. </p>

<p>Water self-ionization is caused because of autoprotolysis. This led me to research autoprotolysis constants. Some specific research was conducted in this area by Faraji, Farajtabar and Gharib (<a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266568936_Determination_of_Water-Ethanol_Mixtures_Autoprotolysis_Constants_and_Solvent_Effect"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Determination of Water-Ethanol Mixtures Autoprotolysis Constants and Solvent Effect</a>). This roughly concurs with the pKa of 15.9 (Faraji et al. found a pKa of 16.62 with 90% ethanol and 10% water). </p>

<p>According to Wikipedia, the higher the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_dissociation_constant"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">acid dissociation constant</a> the lower the chance that it will dissociate at any given pH. Since the pKa of pure ethanol would be higher, would it dissociate (I am unaware of what threshold is required). Even though I read the article, I was unsure about the autoprotolysis constant that it claimed to be investigating. It seems to me that the constant is just a pKa value, not anything more.</p>

<p>So, is it possible to determine whether high concentrations of ethanol conducts electricity or not? Will methylated spirits conduct electricity? In my research, I was not able to find anything like a conductivity or resistivity constant. Are these available for ethanol? What are they?</p>

Active masses of solids and liquids,"<p>In the calculation for equilibrium constant, we take the active mass of solids and liquids as unity.

Can Potassium Carbonate be used to reduce Calcium hardness in water,"<p>I have a solution of KCl 20g/l (2%) and 500mg/l Ca,

",130961,01-04-2020 22:34,Why are potassium organic salts ever preferable to the sodium equivalents?,"<p>$\ce{KOH}$, $\ce{KCN}$, $\ce{KNO3}$, $\ce{K2CO3}$, and plenty of other potassium salts are frequently used in industry.  But, as far as I can see, the sodium equivalents are also widely used, often interchangeably.  Since Na weighs only 60% of K it seems like the sodium salts should always be preferred because they carry more of whatever base is attached per unit weight (i.e., the sodium salts have ""more of what you want""). $\ce{Na}$ is also slightly more abundant (on earth) than K.</p>

<p>So what other factors favor the industrial use of K-salts?  E.g., are K-salts just more abundant in natural sources?  Are they more reactive because the ionization energies of K are lower than those of Na?  Are the behaviors of these simpler salts actually different between the K- and Na- variants, and if so, is there some other elemental characteristic that suggests this?</p>

<p>Going the other way, it seems like if K is preferable to Na, Rb should be even more so (because it appears that in every elemental characteristic in which K exceeds Na, Rb exceeds K).  Would it be if it weren't so relatively scarce?</p>

This base undergoes a very low ionization, even in its pure form (pure form implies that there isn't the presence of a solvent). The concentration of  $\ce{OH-}$ ions, that our base generates, can be assumed to be $ \le 10^{-6} $. Now, let us add some water to $\ce{MOH}$ so as to dilute it. Ostwald's dilution law states that if the degree of dissociation ($ \alpha $) is very less as compared to unity, which in this case, <em>is</em>, it can be calculated by the equation $ \alpha = \sqrt{\frac{K_a}{C}} $. This leads to the conclusion that as I make the solution less concentrated (by dilution), $ \alpha $ increases.</p>

Since the concentration of $ \ce{OH-} $ ions our base generated in its pure form was comparable to the concentration of $ \ce{OH-} $ ions generated by water, they may cause the first equilibrium to be shifted in the backward direction, thus leading to a decrease in $ \alpha $ upon dilution.

Different direction of dipole moment in physics and chemistry,"<p>In chemistry, we learn that dipole moment tells us about measure of polarity in a molecule. In books, it is written that ""conventionlly the direction of dipole moment is from electropositive to electronegative element or less electronegative to more electronegative element"" </p>

<p>My question is that in physics we are taught that the direction of dipole moment is from negative charge to positive charge as convention, so what is the basis behind the conventions of dipole moment in the two subjects which leads to different signs of dipole moment? </p>
",132270,21-04-2020 15:57,"What is the origin of the ""positive-to-negative"" convention concerning dipole moments in chemistry?","<p>I'm a physics professor who often teaches students who have taken a lot of chemistry (read:  pre-meds).  In physics, the dipole moment of a charge configuration is defined as pointing from concentrations of negative charge towards concentrations of positive charge.  This is embodied in the formula we use for the dipole moment of a charge configuration,
$$
\vec{p} = \sum_i q_i \vec{r}_i.
$$
It's not too hard to see that this yields a vector that points from negative charges to positive charges.  For example, if I have a charge of $-e$ at the origin ($\vec{r} = 0$) and a charge of $+e$ a distance $d$ away, this formula yields a vector that points from the negative charge to the positive charge, with magnitude $ed$.</p>

<p>However, the first time I taught this material in a class with a large number of chemistry students, they were very confused;  they had always learned that the dipole vector of a polar molecule points from positive charge towards negative charge, i.e., in the opposite direction of the convention from physics.  For example, by the physics convention, the dipole moment of the water molecule points away from the point of the ""V"" formed by the bonds, while under the chemistry convention, the dipole moment points in the direction of the point of the ""V"".  </p>

<p>How did this convention arise?  Is there an advantage to defining the dipole vectors this way in chemistry calculations?  Or is it one of those scientific conventions that someone wrote down one point, and got ingrained in textbooks ever since?  (Is it <a href=""https://xkcd.com/567/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">all Benjamin Franklin's fault?</a>)</p>

"Comparison of basicity of Aniline, p-Anisidine, and o-Anisidine","<p>I have a question where I am required to compare the basicity of Aniline, o-Anisidine, and p-Anisidine. 
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/68KN8.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/68KN8.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Now here's what I do know:-</p>

<p>In ortho substituted aniline, an ortho effect acts which reduces the basicity of the ortho-substituted aniline. But, my text book (Solomons and Fryhle) states that this effect doesn't act if the ortho substituent is <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{-OH}$</span> or <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{-OCH3}$</span>. So I should be able to do the comparison here without taking into account this ortho effect.</p>

<p>Now here's my try:</p>

<p>In Aniline, clearly the lone pair is quite a bit delocalised in the benzene ring which reduces its availability. Now, <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{-OCH3}$</span> is a group that has both <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{-I}$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{+M}$</span>. </p>

<p>Taking a look at the para variant, clearly there is <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{+M}$</span> acting which reduces the extent of delocalization of the Nitrogen lone pair, thus making it more available. Also, the <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{-I}$</span> effect in the para is lesser than that in the ortho variant, so in the para variant, much more of the electron density of the Nitrogen lone pair is available which helps in easier donation, and thus I find the para variant to be the most basic which is all well and good.</p>

<p>The problem arises in the next part of the comparison, between Aniline, and o-Anisidine.</p>

<p>If the ortho effect isn't acting, due to the <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{+M}$</span> effect of the <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{-OCH3}$</span> group,  the lone pair of the Nitrogen should be more available for donation than that of Aniline, (but less than the availability in the para case, due to stronger <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{-I}$</span> in the ortho case), and thus the Ortho variant should be more basic.</p>

<p>But my book states that the basicity order is : p-Anisidine>Aniline>o-Anisidine</p>

<p>I cannot really understand why the basicity order of the last two (Aniline>o-Anisidine) is the way that it is, if no ortho effect is acting and <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{-OCH3}$</span> has a <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{+M}$</span> effect.</p>

<p>PS: Just took a look at Peter Sykes and the order given is same as that in my book. This this due to the fact that in ortho, the molecule goes slightly out of plane, so <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{+M}$</span> effect may not be as effective?</p>

The dissymetry or chirality of molecules translates to the rotation of plane polarized light, the magnitude and direction depending on the concentration and the nature of the substance. But why does molecular chirality cause the rotation of plane polarized light.<br>
If this rotation is due to the assymetry around the bond, the different molecules are oriented in all possible directions(randomly) and hence the light will fall on them in all different orientations, and should ultimately be undeflected since for every orientation of the molecule, we can reverse the orientation such that the light appears to be falling on the molecule from a direction other than the one for our original molecule.<br>
Moreover, why does inverting the configuration invariably reverses the direction of rotation of light? </p>

<p>The hybridization of $S$ in $SO2$ is sp2 which means it has only one unhybridized p orbital to form a $\pi$ bond. How does it form two?
Could it be one electron from a $p$ orbital getting promoted to a $d$ orbital leading to one $d-p$ and one $p-p$ $\pi$ bond. Is this even possible or are $\pi$ bonds only between p orbitals? Could the electrons possibly be delocalized in the $d-p$ and $p-p$ $\pi$ bonds?</p>

It is described as sp². But how can that be? This seems unlikely
because d-orbitals are involved since the sulfur underwent valence
expansion.</p>

<p>On might imagine a pair of electrons from the 3s/3p oribital(s) being promoted to an empty d-orbital and then having the 3s and 3p orbitals hybridize in to sp².

valence-expanded sulfur consists of 2 electrons occupying

But, the polarity of the bond in <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{HF}$</span> is the greatest, how then is the strongest bond?</p>
<p>I understand that fluorine has smaller valence atomic orbital (2p) than, for example, iodine (5p), and so has more effective overlap with the s-orbital of hydrogen.

The electrons remain more with fluorine in <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{HF}$</span> than with iodine in <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{HI}$</span>, so intuitively it seems that the hydrogen fluorine bond may be more easily broken by a base than the hydrogen iodine bond. So what is going on?</p>
<p>In short, <strong>how can a bond be stable when it is highly polar</strong>?</p>

This means that the fluorine-carbon bond is the hardest to break. But fluorine has very high electronegativity, and so the bond must be highly polar. But inspite of this, fluorine has the highest bond strength!</p>
<p>So is this just a misconception I have? If it isn't a misconception, then <strong>why does the highly polar bond have the maximum bond strength</strong>?</p>

Order of filling of molecular orbitals in heteronuclear diatomic molecules such as CO,"<p>Currently studying for possibly my last Chemistry exam in my life, can't understand why physics undergrads have to learn chemistry as high level as this, but oh well.</p>

<p>So I'm currently dealing with Molecular Orbital theory to predict the strength of bonds between various atoms and whether the resulting molecule will be paramagnetic or diamagnetic. </p>

<p>Now, I have discovered that for homonuclear diatomic molecules, there are two different molecular orbital filling orders, as in, for Li$_2$ all the way to N$_2$, the two $\pi_{2p}$ orbitals are filled before the $\sigma_{2p}$ orbital is filled.</p>

<p>From O$_2$ onwards, the $\sigma_{2p}$ orbital is less energetic than the two $\pi_{2p}$ orbitals, and thus the $\sigma_{2p}$ orbital is filled before.</p>

<p>Is there a rule of thumb on how to predict which molecular orbital will be more energetic in molecules where the two atoms follow different orbital filling orders in their corresponding diatomic molecules, or is there not?</p>

Sometimes, threshold energy ($E_\mathrm t$) is defined as the minimum energy required for reaction to proceed and $E_\mathrm a = E_\mathrm t-\mathrm{KE_{average}}$. If this definition is true, then threshold energy and not activation energy should be in the Arrhenius equation.

Why is Red Phosphorous used in the Nagai Method?,"<p>The most common method of producing Dextromethamphetamine (Crystal Meth) is supposedly the Nagai Method, where Pseudoephedrine, Hydriodic acid and Red Phosphorous are refluxed overnight, producing a mixture of Dextromethamphetamine, water and <em>Red Phosphorous</em> which may be reused.</p>

<p>The thing is, I don't quite understand how the Red Phosphorous ends up in the mixture as though it were acting as a catalyst. </p>

<p>Pseudoephedrine + Hydriodic acid --> Iodoephedrine + Water<br>
Iodoephedrine + Hydriodic acid --> Methamphetamine + Iodine </p>

Shouldn't weak acids act as strong ones in alkaline solutions?,"<p>A weak acid in water dissociates reversibly as follows:</p>

<p>$$\ce{XH &lt;=&gt; X- + H+}$$</p>

<p>A strong base is one which dissociates completely. </p>

<p>Now, let's assume we're doing acid-base titrations, adding a weak acid to a strong base, trying to arrive at the titration curve. </p>

<p>My question is mainly why the $\mathrm{pH}$ at the equivalence point isn't $7$. Intuitively, it makes sense, one dissociates fully while the other doesn't. But if you dig into it a bit deeper you realise that that answer is incomplete. </p>

<p>Bear with me. You add the weak acid to the strong base until you reach the equivalence point. The strong base dissociates completely while the acid establishes an equilibrium as described above. However, thinking about it you realise that at no point should this be possible. An $\ce{OH-}$ ion from the base quickly reacts with any H+ ions produced meaning that $[\ce{H+}]$ is always near zero, meaning that more and more of the weak acid needs to dissociate to establish equilibrium. However, the $\ce{H+}$ concentration will always be 0 as any hydrogen ions are snapped up meaning that the acid will completely dissociate before it has a chance to establish equilibrium, at which point all of the $\ce{OH-}$ ions will also have been neutralised. The $\mathrm{pH}$ of this resulting solution should in other words at that point be $7$, because the acid, even though it's weak, acts as a strong one in an alkaline environment. </p>

<p>What I'm really looking for is <strong>why</strong> the d orbital is more stable this way. I assume it has to do with distributing the negative charge of the electrons as evenly as possible around the nucleus since each orbital of the d subshell is in a slightly different location, leading to a more positive charge in the last empty or half-filled d orbital. Putting the final electron in the s orbital would create a more negative charge around the atom as a whole, but still leave that positive spot empty.</p>

<p><strong>Why does this not happen with the other columns as well?</strong> Does this extra stability work with all half or completely filled orbitals, except columns 6 and 11 are the only cases where the difference is strong enough to 'pull' an electron from the s orbital?

VSEPR bond angles,"<p>My teacher gave a practice exam concerning VSEPR and bond angles and in the following diagram, he wrote the bond angle as greater than 109.5. However, I thought that the ideal angle should be 109.5 exactly. It makes sense that since chlorine is more electronegative, the electron cloud density will be pulled closer to it and so the repulsion will be greater, however I can't seem to find any sources to support that claim.

"Ionic Character, on which factors do it depend","<p>I was watching a lecture of chemistry teacher. He gave the following question:</p>

<p>Q Arrange in terms of increasing ionic character: LiF,NaF,KF,RbF,CsF?</p>

<p>My try: I tried two approaches:
Approach 1: As F is common to all compounds, therefore its metal that affects the ionic character. As we move down the group as in this case, the shielding effect increases and hence it becomes more easier to abstract an electron from the outermost shell or in other words, Ionization energy decreases as we move down the group, therefore CsF>RbF>KF>NaF>LiF should be the order.</p>

<p>Approach 2: Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs have same electrovalency. As Cs has more larger size, the positive charge intensity on the atom decreases and thus by formula of electrostatic force F=-kq1q2/r^2, the electrostatic force of attraction decreases and thus lattice energy decreases and therefore order is:
LiF>NaF>KF>RbF>CsF.</p>

<p>According to me lattice energy should determine ionic character as lattice energy determines ionic bond strength I think and therefore approach 2 should be more legitimate but when I checked the answer, the answer by Approach 1 was correct. Why is it so? Which of the approach is right and which is wrong and why? Is there any other approach?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many disaccharides, like <em>cellobiose, lactose</em> and <em>maltose</em>, also have a reducing form, as one of the two units may have an open-chain form with an aldehyde group. However, <em>sucrose</em> and <em>trehalose</em>, in which the anomeric carbons of the two units are linked together, are nonreducing disaccharides since neither of the rings is capable of opening.</p>

<p>The Wikiedia article probably implies that this has to do with the fact that both the monomers of sucrose are bound through their anomeric carbons, which is not the case with maltose.

<p>At first I thought it should be the  2-chloro-2-methylpropane because from what I know methyl groupss are electron donating groups and benzene rings are almost always electron withdrawing groups, thus the methyl groups will help stabilize the carbocation more.

I've searched a couple of other sites and gone through my book as well but it doesn't quite explain this.</p>

On the  2-chloro-2-methylpropane the carbocation I'm referring to is the one forming on the central carbon atom and on the chloromethyl benzene its the one on the carbon atom of the methyl group. Hope that makes it clear; both are formed due to losing ionisation of the $\ce{C-Cl}$ bond.</p>

I was under the impression that hydrogen bonds were much weaker than the ionic bonds in sodium chloride, so how do they overcome the ionic bond strength? Do the ions simply get swarmed with enough water molecules so that the combined dipole interaction forces break the ionic bond? Or is it possible that because the sodium chloride dissolution reaction is endothermic the hydrogen bonds on their own are not enough to break the ionic bonds so the reaction must draw energy from the surroundings to do so (the reaction must be entropically favorable to do so, right?)?</p>
",72020,05-04-2017 19:26,Why do salts such as NaCl dissolve?,"<p>If we look at solubility of salts in water, we are told that they disassociate, because the positive $\ce{Na}$ ion is attracted to the partially negative oxygen in water and the negative  $\ce{Cl}$ is attracted to the partially positive hydrogen. But why does this happen? I mean, the couloumb force should be much stronger between the $+1$ and $-1$ charges on the $\ce{Na}$ and $\ce{Cl}$ than the partial charges on the polar water molecule. Why does $\ce{NaCl}$, then, disassociate? It would make much more sense for the two ions to stick together. </p>

<p>Also, when you cut $\ce{NaCl}$, shouldn't it stick to its pieces? Look at salt crystals: they don't have any force of attraction between them. But, if you have positive sodium ions and negative chloride ions, then they should stick together. </p>

The most stable resonance structure,"<p>I came across this question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Which is the most stable resonating structure of <em>p</em>-nitrosobenzene

</blockquote>

<p>I have been taught about the priorities for resonance structure stability as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Complete octet $\rightarrow$ more stable</p></li>
  <li><p>Uncharged $\rightarrow$ more stable</p></li>
  <li><p>Lower formal charge $\rightarrow$ more stable</p></li>
  <li><p>Less separation between opposite charges $\rightarrow$ more stable </p></li>
  <li><p>Negative charge near more electronegative atoms and positive charge near less electronegative atoms $\rightarrow$ more stable </p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>So according to the above rules, (b) and (c) are the among the most stable. Bu then applying rule #4 above, (b) should be more stable, because here each positive charge is in vicinity of negative charge.</p>

<p>However the answer given is (c). Why is this?</p>

<p>So the first thing I do is try out the Arrhenius equation:</p>

",72401,11-04-2017 17:40,"Prove that a 10-Degree Temperature Increase Doubles the Rate Constant (k), when the Activation Energy is Approximately 50 kJ/mol","<p>I read that increasing the temperature by $10~^\circ\mathrm C$ will double the rate constant ($k$), when the activation energy for the reaction is relatively close to $50~\mathrm{kJ/mol}$.</p>

<p>However, no matter how hard I try to wrap my head around it (through graphical examples that require plotting the natural logarithm of $k$ vs the inverse of temperature), I just can't grasp this so called ""rule of thumb"". </p>

<p>As a result, I tried proving this statement through mathematical expressions:</p>

<p>(Note that the activation energy was evaluated for $50\,000$ because it needs to be expressed in $\mathrm{J/mol}$ to be used in Arrhenius' equation)</p>

<p><em>Prove that...</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A rise of temperature of $10\ \mathrm{^\circ C}$ will double the rate constant, when the activation energy for the reaction is approximately $50\ \mathrm{kJ/mol}$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Proof starts here -----------------------------</strong></p>

<p><em>For:</em>  $\Delta T = T_2 - T_1$ ($T_2$ is the final temperature, and $T_1$ the initial temperature)</p>

<p><em>When:</em> $\Delta T = 10 \rightarrow T_2 - T_1 = 10$</p>

<p><em>It follows that:</em> The ratio between $k_2$ (at $T_2$) and $k_1$ (at $T_1$) will equal $2$, owing to the doubling of the rate constant ($k$):</p>

<p>$$
{k_2\over k_1} = 2
$$</p>

<p><em>Employing Arrhenius' equation:</em></p>

<p>$$
{k_2\over k_1} = {A\mathrm e^{\left({-E_\mathrm a\over RT_2}\right)}\over A\mathrm e^{\left({-E_\mathrm a\over RT_1}\right)}}
       = \mathrm e^{\left[{-E_\mathrm a\over R}\left({1\over T_2} – {1\over T_1}\right)\right]}
       = 2
$$</p>

<p><em>Or simply:</em></p>

<p>$$
{k_2\over k_1} = \exp{\!\left({-E_\mathrm a\over R} \cdot \Delta{1\over T} \right)} = 2
$$</p>

<p><em>So:</em></p>

<p>$$
\exp{\!\left({-E_\mathrm a\over R} \cdot \Delta{1\over T} \right)} = 2
$$</p>

<p><strong>This might be the part where I messed up -------------------------</strong></p>

<p>$\Delta{1\over T}$ can be set in terms of $\Delta T$:</p>

<p>$$
\Delta{1\over T} = \left({1\over T_2}-{1\over T_1}\right)
       = \left({T_1\over T_1T_2}-{T_2\over T_1T_2}\right)
       = \left({T_1-T_2\over T_1T_2}\right)
       = \left({-\Delta T\over T_1T_2}\right)
$$</p>

<p>Since Arrhenius' equation above holds true for $\Delta T = 10$ ...</p>

<p>And since $\Delta{1\over T}$ can be expressed as $-\Delta T \over T_1T_2$ ...</p>

<p>Then, the rate constant ($k$) will double when:</p>

<p>$$
\Delta{1\over T} = {-10\over T_1T_2}
$$</p>

<p>Substituting into Arrhenius' equation:</p>

<p>$$
\exp{\!\left({-E_\mathrm a\over R}\cdot{-10\over T_1T_2}\right)} = 2
$$</p>

<p>Simplifying:</p>

<p>$$
\begin{align}
\exp{\left({10E_\mathrm a\over RT_1T_2}\right)} &amp;= 2 \\
{10E_\mathrm a\over RT_1T_2} &amp;= \ln{2} \\
{1\over T_1 T_2} &amp;= {R\cdot\ln{2}\over 10E_\mathrm a} \\
T_1 T_2 &amp;= {10E_\mathrm a\over R\cdot\ln{2}}
\end{align}
$$</p>

<p>From $T_2 - T_1 = 10$ we can solve for $T_2$ as $T_2 = T_1 + 10$. Substituting above:</p>

<p>$$
\begin{align}
T_1 (T_1 + 10) &amp;= {10E_\mathrm a\over R\cdot\ln{2}} \\
T_1^2 + 10T_1 - {10E_\mathrm a\over R\cdot\ln{2}} &amp;= 0
\end{align}
$$</p>

<p>For $E_\mathrm a = 50\,000$:</p>

<p>$$
T_1^2 + 10T_1 - {500\,000\over R\cdot\ln{2}} = 0
$$</p>

<p>Solving the quadratic equation:</p>

<p>$$
\begin{align}
T_1 &amp;= 290~\mathrm K \\
T_2 &amp;= 300~\mathrm K \\
\Delta T &amp;= 10~\mathrm K
\end{align}
$$</p>

<p>I don't think this proof is correct because substituting any value for activation energy ($E_\mathrm a$) onto the quadratic equation will produce different values for $T_1$, but that doesn't tell me anything.</p>

Can this be proved any other way? </p>

<p>What I'm really looking for is <strong>why</strong> the d orbital is more stable this way. I assume it has to do with distributing the negative charge of the electrons as evenly as possible around the nucleus since each orbital of the d subshell is in a slightly different location, leading to a more positive charge in the last empty or half-filled d orbital. Putting the final electron in the s orbital would create a more negative charge around the atom as a whole, but still leave that positive spot empty.</p>

<p><strong>Why does this not happen with the other columns as well?</strong> Does this extra stability work with all half or completely filled orbitals, except columns 6 and 11 are the only cases where the difference is strong enough to 'pull' an electron from the s orbital? It seems like fluorine would have a tendency to do do this as well, so I suppose the positive gap left in the unfilled p orbital isn't strong enough to remove an electron from the lower 2s orbital.</p>

Structure and bonding in ClO2,"<p>To draw the structure of $\ce{ClO2}$, I tried to find the hybridization of the central atom i.e $\ce{Cl}$.

So, $\ce{ClO2}$ is an odd electron species.  </p>

<p>Then, how do I find its hybridization and draw its structure?</p>

<p>Can I not just count the number of &sigma; bonds and the number of lone pairs as usual, i.e, considering the 3 non bonding electrons as 1 lone pair, and find the number of hybrid orbitals and thus, find its hybridization?

Am I right in my determination of bonding and nonbonding electrons of the atom or is there something special in this compound $\ce{ClO2}$?</p>

<p>Now, let's follow the logic. We have a greater electronegativity difference between $\ce{O}$ and $\ce{Si}$ ($3.44 - 1.90 = 1.54$) than between $\ce{O}$ and $\ce{H}$ ($3.44 - 2.2 = 1.24$). </p>

<p>For the lower oxygen with the bonded hydrogen, assuming an angle of 120 degrees , you would get a total dipole moment of: $1.54 + 1.24 = 2.78$
(please tell me if I'm wrong to assume a straight line!)</p>

<p>So, this would mean that you have a greater accumulation of electrons at the bottom oxygen, which would favor Van Der Waals attraction (Debye interaction, I guess, since you have a permanent dipole and an induced dipole). This, in turn, would mean that it would be a better nucleation site.</p>

<p>NOW, i like ranting, so i'll go on. If you make a surface treatment using silane groups, I think that you promote the presence of $\ce{OH}$ groups at your silica surface, although my understanding/knowledge is hazy at this point. I do know that it makes better silver mirroring though. I made another drawing:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/5cOzEFM.png"" alt=""silanisation""></p>

<p>Following my logic, this one is wrong in many way. First of all, I drew angles on the $\ce{Si-O-H}$ bonds, which I didn't draw on my first pictures. Second, the silver is not even near the oxygen atoms, which are supposed to be the nucleation points, according to me.</p>

<p>I'm confused, could you please point out to me where i'm right and wrong in my logic/knowledge?
Mainly:
- Is there a bond forming between the silica surface and the silver or is it Van Der Waals (Debye) attraction only?
- Is my depiction of nucleation &amp; growth correct (the first two pictures)?
- Did I make the electronegativity maths correctly?
- Is my logic of "" higher total electronegativity difference, hence better nucleation site"" correct? (assuming I'm right about the Van Der Waals thing)
- Is my depiction of silanisation correct?
- Am I right to say that the higher presence of surface $\ce{OH}$ groups by silanisation mean better nucleation
- If this is the case, could I do the same thing using a strong acid on my glass surface?</p>

Stability and Resonance,"<p>The linked answers do attempt to clarify on 'stability' but I wanted an answer with specific connection to resonance. </p>

<p>For example, the ethanoate ion can exist in many forms but, as we know from data, it exists in a form that is a hybrid of all the possible forms. Why is this? 
I have heard teachers say that this is since that form has 'less energy' or is 'more stable.' I understand - from the linked answer- that these terms are open to interpretation. The criteria my teacher used was that in each of the contributing mesomers, the electrons are localised. But in the hybrid, they are delocalised. Now I understand this results in more 'stability' in some sense of the word. </p>

<p>But is that only criteria ? Should we not also consider the electronegativities of the atoms involved, for example? Basically, why is the hybrid form the form in which the structure exists?     </p>

<p>In the lab we synthesized $\ce{YBa2Cu3O7}$, per the lab manual $\ce{Y, Ba, O}$ have the usual charges of +3, +2, and -2 respectively. Spectroscopic studies show that no copper (III) centers are present in the material, but rather there are missing electrons from the copper-oxygen bonds. For the purpose of the titration though, the missing electrons are thought of as coming from the copper center and we're assuming there are copper III centers present. </p>

<p>We used idodine to tritrate, and there is the assumption that copper is doing the oxidizing. The text states, ""Copper(I) is not an oxidizing equivalent: It cannot oxidize iodide to iodine.""</p>

<p>The relevant equations are 
$$\begin{align}
\ce{Cu^{3+} + 2I- &amp;-&gt; Cu+ +I2}\\
\ce{Cu^{2+} +I- &amp;-&gt; Cu+ + \frac{1}{2}I2}

$$\ce{Y} (3^+ )+\ce{Ba} (2^+ * 2)+\ce{O} (2^-*7)= \frac{7}{3 \ \ce{Cu}}\ce{Cu}^{2.3+}$$</p>

<p>We have to calulate the theoretical number of equivalents of $\ce{I-}$ oxidized by 1 g of the sample. </p>

<p>Would this be correct for the oxidation state? If so would that mean that the total equivalents of Iodine are an addition of $\ce{Cu(II)}$ and $\ce{Cu(III)}$ (the two equations)? Also I'm feeling brain dead, because I can't figure out the fraction of $\ce{Cu(II)}$ and $\ce{Cu(III)}$ that would average to 2.3.</p>

"Textbook Claim: ""... in all cases it is the electrostatic force acting between charged particles that is responsible for all the forms of bonding.""","<p>I am reading an introductory semiconductor physics textbook. The textbook states the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Several types of atomic bonding have been identified, including ionic, covalent, van der Waals, hydrogen, and metallic. Whatever the name given to the type of bonding, in all cases it is the electrostatic force acting between charged particles that is responsible for all the forms of bonding.</p>

<p>My concern is with the validity of the latter sentence; that is, that all cases of bonding are electrostatic forces acting between charged particles.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> says the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A chemical bond is a lasting attraction between atoms, ions or molecules that enables the formation of chemical compounds. The bond may result from the electrostatic force of attraction between oppositely charged ions as in ionic bonds or through the sharing of electrons as in covalent bonds.</p>

<p>If electrostatic forces act between charged particles (ions), and atoms are, by definition, <em>neutral</em> particles, then, since atoms do bond, how can it make sense to say that all bonding is electrostatic forces acting between charged particles?</p>

<p>And my interpretation of the Wikipedia article is that the electrostatic force of attraction is responsible for bonding between oppositely charged ions, as in ionic bonding, whereas it is not responsible for bonding through the sharing of electrons, as in covalent bonding.</p>

I heard that the concept changes when it comes to molecular orbital theory. Only similar orbitals (like $1s$-$1s$,$2p_x$-$2p_x$,$3p_y$-$3p_y$) form bonds but ($2s$-$2p_z$) do not.

",112738,14-04-2019 16:46,Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution: Are protonated OH-groups ortho-/para- or meta-directing?,"<p>In Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution ($\text{S}_{\text{E}}\text{Ar}$) reactions groups that can donate an electron pair into the aromatic ring, e.g. $\ce{-OH}$ or $\ce{-NH2}$, are <em>ortho</em>-/<em>para</em>-directing.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/66MCG.png"" height=""150""></p>

<p>In the case of $\ce{-NH2}$-groups one has to be cautious because if the $\text{pH}$ value of the solution is too low the $\ce{-NH2}$-group will be present mostly in its protonated form, $\ce{-NH3^+}$, which lacks a free electron pair and has a <em>meta</em>-directing effect because of its strong $-I$ effect. This brings up the question: What is the situation like with protonated $\ce{-OH}$ groups, $\ce{-OH2^{+}}$? In contrast to $\ce{-NH3^+}$ this group still has a free electron pair which could, in principle, interact with the aromatic ring ($\Rightarrow$ <em>ortho</em>-/<em>para</em>-directing) but it should also have a very powerful $-I$ effect ($\Rightarrow$ <em>meta</em>-directing).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bCOdy.png"" height=""130""></p>

<p>I'd say, if the electron pair can be effeciently delocalised into the aromatic ring then its <em>ortho</em>-/<em>para</em>-directing power should outweigh the meta-directing power of the inductive effect. But I wonder if there even is any appreciable degree of delocalisation present because the mesomeric structures don't look very favourable:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/V0Zgb.png"" height=""150""></p>

<p>Thinking about it from a frontier orbital perspective I would say: The orbital of the $\ce{-OH2^{+}}$ group's free electron pair will be much lower in energy than that of the $\ce{-OH}$ group's free electron pair. Thus, the energy difference between free electron pair's orbital and the aromatic ring's $\pi$-system might be too large to facilitate a good interaction. Therefore, I'd expect a protonated $\ce{-OH}$ group to be <em>meta</em>-directing.</p>

<p>But what is the actual situation when phenols or phenol ethers undergo ($\text{S}_{\text{E}}\text{Ar}$) reactions in strongly acidic solutions? Does one get the <em>ortho/para</em> or the <em>meta</em> product?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>I looked up the $\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}$ value for protonated phenol: It is approximately $-7$. This makes me wonder if there are any reasonable (real world) situations where the solution is acidic enough to protonate phenol (or phenol ethers) completely (even $\ce{HI}$ with its $\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}$ of $-10$ shouldn't be enough for that, right). I'm not sure if even sulfonation or nitration reach such low $\text{pH}$ values.
But @Uncle Al's answer made me aware that I forgot about Lewis acids and I'd say that Lewis acids like $\ce{AlCl3}$ that coordinate strongly to oxygen might lead to a state that will be very similar to a $\ce{-OH2^{+}}$ group (please, correct me if I'm wrong and the coordination of Lewis acids is not strong enough to be compared to the $\ce{O-H}$-bond). If this is the case, then what about Friedel-Crafts reactions which make heavy use of Lewis acids: Would those Lewis acids interfere with the <em>ortho</em>-/<em>para</em>-directing properties of phenols? Does anyone have experience with the directional properties of a $\ce{-OH}$ group in the presence of a strong Lewis acid, maybe even in the context of Friedel-Crafts reactions?</p>

",112866,16-04-2019 16:42,Is there a general consensus on the causes of the alpha-effect?,"<p>There have been various explanations posited for the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_effect"" rel=""noreferrer"">α-effect</a>. The α-effect refers to a phenomenon wherein nucleophiles with lone pairs on atoms adjacent (i.e., in the α- position) to the atom bearing the reacting lone pair sometimes exhibit dramatically higher reactivity than similar nucleophiles without α-electrons. This effect is especially adduced when no associated increase in Brønsted basicity occurs. For example, hydroperoxide ($\ce{HOO-}$) experimental reaction rate constants are orders of magnitude greater<sup>[1]</sup> those of hydroxide ($\ce{HO-}$) with various electrophilic substrates, despite the former exhibiting lower Brønsted basicity. There is also a thermodynamic α-effect, in which equilibrium constants are enhanced<sup>[2]</sup>. It is currently on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_chemistry"" rel=""noreferrer"">list of unsolved problems in chemistry</a> on Wikipedia, but, due to a lack of references to that effect, I'm not entirely convinced it really should be listed there. Here's the summary of my research on the topic thus far:</p>

<ul>
<li>I read Ren, Y. &amp; Yamataka, H.<sup>[3]</sup>, <em>""The alpha-effect in gas-phase S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions revisited""</em>. In it, they claim that explanations based on ground-state destabilization (presumably due to repulsion between the electrons of the nucleophilic atom and the α-electrons) are not correct. Their reasoning is that this would result in a difference in the $\Delta G$ between reactants and products, leading to thermodynamic equilibrium effects. They argue that a correct explanation should be one exclusively involving stabilization of the transition state (i.e., minimization of $\Delta G^{\ddagger}$), and go on to offer some explanation for how this may occur (along with experimental data). Intuitively, their conclusion seems reasonable to me, and it also (at least to my naive comprehension) seems eminently testable. I don't know whether equilibrium effects consistent with ground-state destabilization have actually been observed or not; however, if they haven't, shouldn't that put the nail in the coffin of that theory? Or is it simply that the authors are searching for a purely kinetic α-effect, so that a distinction between a thermodynamic one needs to be made?</li>
<li>Fleming devotes a section to the effect in his book, <em>Molecular Orbitals and Organic Chemical Reactions</em>. He notes that the presence of the α-lone pair should raise the energy of the HOMO of the nucleophile, but also points that experimental results don't correlate sufficiently well with the HOMO energies of various α-nucleophiles. In particular, certain soft electrophiles (per HSAB theory), such as alkyl halides, apparently show an anomalous low preference for α-nucleophiles. In the context of SET mechanisms, Fleming says that the higher energy of the HOMO and the availability of α-electrons (which can stabilize a radical intermediate) ought to have a highly favorable effect on the rate of reaction, and notes that experimental results have borne this out. My interpretation of this is that, while the picture is perhaps murky for anionic mechanisms, transition-state stabilization clearly seems to be operative in SET mechanisms.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've also read the original 1962 paper by Pearson and Edwards<sup>[4]</sup>, which also largely argued for transition-state stabilization as the primary explanatory mechanism.</p>

<p>Overall, from my reading thus far, it seems that transition-state stabilization has been most consistently invoked and has the largest wealth of evidence and the most plausible arguments supporting it. What I'd like to ask is, <strong>(a)</strong> are there flaws in my reasoning or understanding of the material, and <strong>(b)</strong> is this truly a fundamentally unsolved problem, or is there actually some emerging consensus among experts?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Notes and References</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Fleming provides a small table with relative rates ($k_\mathrm{rel} = k_{\ce{HOO-}}/k_{\ce{HO-}}$) in his book. For example, he gives $k_\mathrm{rel} \approx 10^5$ for reaction with $\ce{PhCN}$ and $k_\mathrm{rel} \approx 50$ for $\ce{PhCH2Br}$, while $k_\mathrm{rel} \approx 10^{-4}$ for reaction with $\ce{H3O+}$. The rate of reaction correlates in the expected way with Brønsted basicity only in the case of proton transfer.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, citing Fleming, he gives the example of the reaction of <em>N</em>-acetylimidazole with hydroxylamines, in which both rate and equilibrium constants are positively affected. Qualitatively, he explains this by noting that the α-electrons raise the energy of the lone pair conjugated to the π-system, making overlap of said lone pair with the π* LUMO more effective. Additionally, he claims <em>both</em> ground-state stabilization and transition-state destabilization as being factors in the reduced electrophilicity of oximes and hydrazones relative to (most) other standard imines.</p></li>

How can the bonding in it be explained using the LCAO (Linear Combination of atomic orbitals) method in molecular orbital theory?</p>

<p>I got this doubt because there are only two ""axial"" d-orbitals ($\mathrm{d}_{z^2}$ and $\mathrm{d}_{x^2-y^2}$) among the 5 present, which can have head-on overlap with p-orbitals (non-axial orbitals can only have sideways overlap). In the excited state, the iodine atom has 7 half filled atomic orbitals (an s-orbital, three p-orbitals, and 3 d-orbitals) and according to LCAO each of them has to combine with one p-orbital of each fluorine atom to form molecular orbitals by &#x3c3; and &#x3c0; bonds. But, the formation of only 6 &#x3c3; bonds can happen between an iodine and 6 fluorine atoms, as &#x3c3; bonds involve head-on overlap of orbitals, and there are only 6 orbitals capable of doing that (the s and p orbitals, and the two 'axial' d-orbitals). Therefore, the seventh fluorine atom must be in p&#x3c0;-d&#x3c0; bond with fluorine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...according to this theory, the position of the lone pair in <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{XeF6}$</span> molecule should be in axial position and the shape should be pentagonal pyramidal. But this is not observed and the actual shape of molecule is octahedral. This implies that the lone pair is placed at equatorial position, and this explains the structure of <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{XeF6}$</span> shown in figures 3.7 a,b,c.</p>
<p>According to Figure 3.7, <span class=""math-container"">$\mu_\text{expected}$</span> for <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{XeF6}$</span> is not equal to zero. But <span class=""math-container"">$\mu_\text{real}(\ce{XeF6})\sim0$</span> . To explain the above facts, it is considered that the actual molecule is in dynamic equilibrium of all the three structures shown in Figure 3.7. Here it is considered that the lone pair is present in the stereochemically active <span class=""math-container"">$s$</span> orbital and similar structure is observed as <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{IF6-}$</span>. But anions like <span class=""math-container"">$[\ce{SbX6}]^{3-}$</span>, <span class=""math-container"">$[\ce{TeX6}]^{2-}$</span> (<span class=""math-container"">$\ce{X}=\ce{Cl, Br, I}$</span>), <span class=""math-container"">$[\ce{BrF6}]^-$</span>,<span class=""math-container"">$[\ce{ICl6}]^-$</span> have been assigned perfectly octahedral structure on the basis of X-ray crystallography and the lone pair is present in stereochemically inactive <span class=""math-container"">$s$</span> orbital.</p>

<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/l0VqP.png"" alt=""order of carbonyl compound versus nucleophiles""><br>
acyl halide > acid anhydride > aldehyde > ketone > ester ~ carboxylic acid > amide > carboxylate ion</p>

<p><em>I am looking here for <strong>any</strong> model that can be used to explain this reactivity.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>I will also later on post an answer to this question using quantum chemical calculations, trying to generalise from example. The key points that will be included are stated in ron's answer linked above.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I like Martin's posts, they make me think - and that is always a good
  thing. Here is where my thinking has taken me:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>I believe Martin's approach (basically frontier MO) is fundamentally
  correct. I would be more convinced that his actual numbers are
  meaningful if he were to calculate 1) the carbonyl carbon LUMO
  coefficient and 2) the HOMO-LUMO separation for the following series
  of compounds in order to see if his calculated values correlated with
  this order of reactivity of carbonyl compounds towards nucleophilic
  attack (we could use water as the nucleophile) - but Martin, I think
  such calculations might be a poor use of your time and resources.</li>
  </ul>

Difference between organic and inorganic chemistry,"<p>This question may seem vague at a first glance, and even lead to the thought: ""come on, just go Google it!""</p>

<p>But it's a real question because it does not make enough sense to me (even after Googling it, a lot).</p>

<p>I was just presented to the words, but not to their definition.</p>

<p>Like: ""Hey, now we will speak about organic nomenclature"".</p>

<p>At some point, books and videos start talking about inorganic and organic as if it was a common sense thing.</p>

<p>A frequent rule I found while trying to understand the difference:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Organic</strong>: has carbon</li>
<li><strong>Inorganic</strong>: does not have carbon</li>
</ul>

<p>But then, some inorganic compounds do have carbon too, and there may even be some  compounds that some call organic, and others call inorganic, like <span class=""math-container"">$CO_2$</span>.</p>

<p>As I have felt it, in my learnings so far, it's like inorganic chemistry is the default chemistry and organic chemistry goes a step beyond.</p>

<p>But I don't quite grasp the difference.</p>

<p>What is the real semantics behind the word ""organic""?</p>

<p>For example, we humans are made of loads of water, and that's a pretty organic thing to me. But then, water is inorganic.</p>

<p>Diamonds are the carbon top of the cake, and do not transmit the idea of being an ""organic"" thing.</p>

<p>Another very confusing thing are polymers, chanins of loads of carbons with other elements, in many shapes and textures. To me, a piece of ""plastic"" is not a very organic thing, but indeed, they are!</p>

<p>That brings the semantics into an even more confusing level.</p>

<p>And of course, there must be historical reasons for those chosen words.</p>

<p>Could someone please point out where this distinction comes from and why it is important?</p>

<p>With all my respect to science and the people who made chemistry a useful thing. This question is not about critics, it's about not knowing the facts, so of course I am the ignorant here.</p>

Enthalpy equals internal energy plus $PV$. In a constant pressure environment, change in enthalpy equals to change in internal energy as $PV$ in constant. Internal energy consists of $E_k$ (kinetic energy) of particles and $E_p$ (potential energy) of bonds between particles. When stronger bonds are formed, $E_p$ is bigger. And the energy of the heat released to environment equals to the energy gained in form of potential energy, so why is the internal energy lower?

Acidic strength of diethyl malonate vs ethyl acetoacetate,"<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1cnwS.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1cnwS.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>In the above compounds, I have marked the hydrogen which I think will be the most acidic. Now removing that hydrogen would yield a carbocation. Both the carbocations would be equally stabilized due to resonance effect. In fact diethyl malonate acid would be more stabilized due to the extra inductive effect of the extra oxygen. Yet Wikipedia shows that ethyl acetoacetate has a p<span class=""math-container"">$K_\text{a}$</span> less than that of diethylmalonate acid.</p>

<p>But, in esters, when the resonance happens between the two oxygen atoms, the oxygen atom gains a positive charge which is highly unstable, given that oxygen is highly electronegative. So, shouldn’t the order of acidity be the other way round?</p>

<p>Now thermodynamics is a common topic to both physics and chemistry and as per my understanding of thermodynamics I am getting different results for the heat that will need to be supplied.</p>

<p>Chemistry says <span class=""math-container"">$$∆U =∆Q +∆W $$</span> and defines work as the work done on the gas and this will give <span class=""math-container"">$$W = -P_{atm}(V_2-V_1) $$</span> and as for isothermal process<span class=""math-container"">$$ ∆U =0 , ∆Q =P_{atm}(V_2-V_1)$$</span></p>

<p>According to physics on the other hand <span class=""math-container"">$$∆Q =∆U+∆W$$</span> and here the work done is the work done by the gas. That is </p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$W = \int_{V_1}^{V_2} PdV=\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \frac{RT}{V}dV = RT \ln V_2-RT \ln V_1$$</span> and as for isothermal process <span class=""math-container"">$$∆U =0 ,\, ∆Q =RT \ln \left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)$$</span> </p>

<p>I am also uncertain that maybe neither of these is the correct expression and the network ok is actually in that work from both these forces and we have to take the sum of these to yield <span class=""math-container"">$$∆Q =RT\ln \left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)-P_{atm}(V_2-V_1)$$</span></p>

<p>Now the value of Q should be unique because in the real world when we perform an experiment, only one value of Q would be supplied.</p>

<p>So which one of these is correct and where am I lacking in my understanding of thermodynamics from a chemistry  standpoint ??</p>

Should there be a difference in the absolute energy gaps between bonding and antibonding MOs from the energy level of the AOs in the H2 molecule?,"<p>I have been reading Molecular Orbitals and Organic Chemical Reactions (Student Edition) by Ian Fleming. On Pg 5, Fleming mentions that the diatomic helium molecule cannot exists because there is an overall energy increase from populating both the bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals equally (i.e. putting 2 electrons into each). However, why should there be a larger absolute energy difference between the antibonding MO and the atomic orbitals compared to the energy difference between the bonding MO and atomic oritals? Fleming explains this by saying that this is due to the presence of inter-electronic repulsion in the MOs as there are two electrons present in each MO. This may seem to make sense. </p>

<p>However, in most MO diagrams, the energy levels of the bonding and antibonding MOs are drawn equidistant away from the energy level of the atomic orbitals. Does there seem to be a contradiction? </p>

<p>It is not a duplicate as I am proposing a new explanation of ""inter-electronic repulsion upon population of the MOs"", which has never been discussed before. </p>
",75451,31-05-2017 13:52,How can antibonding orbitals be more antibonding than bonding orbitals are bonding?,"<p>In molecular orbital theory, the fact that a bonding and antibonding molecular orbital pair have different energies is accompanied by the fact that the energy by which the bonding is lowered is less than the energy by which antibonding is raised, i.e. the stabilizing energy of each bonding interaction is less than the destabilising energy of antibonding. How is that possible if their sum has to equal the energies of the combining atomic orbitals and conservation of energy has to hold true?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Antibonding is more antibonding than bonding is bonding.""</p>

<p>For example, the fact that $\ce{He2}$ molecule is not formed can be explained from its MO diagram, which shows that the number of electrons in antibonding and bonding molecular orbitals is the same, and since the destabilizing energy of the antibonding MO is greater than the stabilising energy of bonding MO, the molecule is not formed.

<p>We know that sodium has a strong reducing capacity, so why does it produce a compound in which the oxygen atom is not reduced to the fullest possible extent?</p>

<hr>

<p>After posting the question, I read up some more and found <a href=""http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group1/reacto2.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this, on Chemguide's page describing the oxidation properties of Group 1 elements:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So why do any of the metals form the more complicated oxides? It is a matter of energetics.</p>
  
  <p>In the presence of sufficient oxygen, they produce the compound whose formation gives out most energy. That gives the most stable compound.</p>
  
  <p>The amount of heat evolved per mole of rubidium in forming its various oxides is:</p>

<p>This is hardly an explanation, because it just says in a circular way that it's energetically profitable to form such compounds. Why is this energetically profitable? </p>

<hr>

<p>Can part of the explanation be ""because in Group 1, starting from $\ce{Na}$, ion charge densities are low enough to allow peroxides and superoxides to exist""?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>After the collision the molecule must travel a distance <span class=""math-container"">$l$</span> to the
opposite wall, and then back across this same distance before
colliding again with the wall in question. This determines the time
between successive collisions with a given wall; the number of
collisions per second will be <span class=""math-container"">$v / 2 l$</span>. The force <span class=""math-container"">$F$</span> exerted on
the wall is the rate of change of the momentum, given by the product
of the momentum change per collision and the collision frequency:</p>
<p><span class=""math-container"">$$F=\frac{d\left(m v_{x}\right)}{d t}=\left(2 m v_{x}\right) \times\left(\frac{v_{x}}{2 l}\right)=\frac{mv_{x}^{2}}{l}$$</span></p>

The proof involves considering a particle with mass <span class=""math-container"">$m$</span> travelling with velocity <span class=""math-container"">$v$</span> inside a cube of side <span class=""math-container"">$x$</span>. The particle is assumed to travel perpendicularly towards one of the sides before bouncing back off it. The force exerted by the particle at any instant is opposite to the force exerted by the side of the cube on the particle. The latter can be worked out using Newton's second law, prior to which we need to calculate the acceleration of the particle during the collision. Assuming the collision to be perfectly elastic, the change in velocity before and after the collision with the wall is <span class=""math-container"">$\Delta v=2v$</span>. To work out average acceleration, according to me, one would need the duration <span class=""math-container"">$\Delta t$</span> of the collision, since assuming it to be instantaneous would imply infinite acceleration. However, the various proofs I've read assign to <span class=""math-container"">$\Delta t$</span> the time that is needed for the particle to bounce off the wall and return after colliding with the opposite wall, in other words <span class=""math-container"">$\Delta t=\frac{2x}{v}$</span>.

",135224,14-06-2020 13:28,What volume does one mole of an ideal gas occupy?,"<p>This has been bugging me for a while now...</p>

<p>Obviously, to calculate the volume/space occupied by a mole of (an ideal) gas, you'll have to specify temperature ($T$) and pressure ($P$), find the gas constant ($R$) value with the right units and plug them all in the ideal gas equation $$PV = nRT.$$</p>

<p>The problem? It seems to be some sort of common ""wisdom"" all over the Internet, that one mole of gas occupies $22.4$ liters of space. But the standard conditions (STP, NTP, or SATP) mentioned lack consistency over multiple sites/books. Common claims: A mole of gas occupies,</p>

<ol>
<li>$\pu{22.4 L}$ at STP</li>
<li>$\pu{22.4 L}$ at NTP</li>
<li>$\pu{22.4 L}$ at SATP</li>
<li>$\pu{22.4 L}$ at <em>both</em> STP and NTP</li>
</ol>

<p><a href=""https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/search?q=22.4"">Even Chem.SE</a> is rife with the ""fact"" that a mole of ideal gas occupies $\pu{22.4 L}$, or some extension thereof.</p>

<p>Being so utterly frustrated with this situation, I decided to calculate the volumes occupied by a mole of ideal gas (based on the ideal gas equation) for each of the three standard conditions; namely: Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), Normal Temperature and Pressure (NTP) and Standard Ambient Temperature and Pressure (SATP).</p>

<p>Knowing that,</p>

<ul>
<li>STP: $\pu{0 ^\circ C}$ and $\pu{1 bar}$</li>
<li>NTP: $\pu{20 ^\circ C}$ and $\pu{1 atm}$</li>
<li>SATP: $\pu{25 ^\circ C}$ and $\pu{1 bar}$</li>
</ul>

<p>And using the equation, $$V = \frac {nRT}{P},$$
where $n = \pu{1 mol}$, by default (since we're talking about one mole of gas).</p>

<p>I'll draw appropriate values of the gas constant $R$ from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_constant"" rel=""noreferrer"">this Wikipedia table</a>:</p>

R &amp;= \pu{8.3144598 \times 10^-2 L bar K^-1 mol^-1}.
\end{align}
Plugging in all the values, I got 
$$V = \pu{22.698475 L},$$ 
which to a reasonable approximation, gives
$$V = \pu{22.7 L}.$$</p></li>
<li><p><strong>At NTP</strong>

P &amp;= \pu{1 atm},&amp;

\end{align}
Plugging in all the values, I got 
$$V = \pu{24.04280003 L},$$ 
which to a reasonable approximation, gives 
$$V = \pu{24 L}.$$</p></li>
<li><p><strong>At SATP</strong>
\begin{align}
T &amp;= \pu{298.0 K},&amp;
P &amp;= \pu{1 bar},&amp;
R &amp;= \pu{8.3144598 \times 10^-2 L bar K^-1 mol^-1}.

Since due to inductive effect of first chlorine, there should be delta plus charge near the chlorine attached atom, so H+ from second Hcl molecule goes to the adjacent atom. Therefore,  same C atom has both Chlorine.

I assume that more hydrogen bonds are formed as water and oil separate but I believe that the main driver is entropy.  Overall the entropy change is positive because the ordered structure of water bonds around each individual fat droplet are broken down and entropy increases, and hence <span class=""math-container"">$\Delta G$</span> is negative. OK, but to me that does not explain why individual fat particles to move.  If there's a change in inertia, then there's a force?  What is the force?</p>
<p>I can accept this explanation on an energetic level but what forces are acting on the oil droplets to effect this?  I can't see any Coulomb forces here.  Whilst I can accept that energetically it might make sense for oil and water to separate, I feel I need a force to explain why matter moves.  Could someone explain what the nature of the hydrophobic interaction is because I don't understand at present.

Carbanion Stability order,"<p>Why is a 3° Carbanion unstable than 1° Carbanion? Carbon atom with negative charge will become little electropositive relative to a neutral carbon. So if a Carbanion is attached to three neutral carbons, essentially it should donate it's electrons distributing the negative charge of -1, thus stabilizing it. By this logic, more carbon atoms attached means more stability. But this does not happen. 1° Carbanion is most stable. Why?</p>

Microscopic and mechanical approach to boiling point,"<p><strong>I am confused as to how I should visualize the boiling process throughout a liquid.</strong></p>

<p>From my understanding, the boiling point of a liquid is when its vapor pressure reaches atmospheric pressure. This makes sense at the surface of the liquid where the pressure of the atmosphere no longer overcomes the pressure of the gas molecules escaping the surface of the liquid, so in some sense it can be thought of, on a conceptual level, as becoming a mixture of ""air"" molecules and ""liquid"" molecules.</p>

<p><strong>BUT, how does this account for the formation of bubbles on the bottom of container holding the liquid?</strong> Wouldn't the gas that is trapped in these crevices need to overcome to pressure of the atmosphere AND the pressure of the liquid itself (looking at it from a physics perspective as well)? How would this phenomena be explained using vapor pressures?</p>

<p>Furthermore, when gas bubbles form within the liquid, should I think of it as the <strong>kinetic energy of those particular liquid molecules are so great that it's ""pushing"" the surrounding liquid molecules with less kinetic energy?</strong></p>

<p>EDIT: Part of my confusion was that I wasn't sure what the composition of these gas bubbles would be exactly—and yes the assumption is that it is being heated from the bottom. Although now I'm curious what would happen if it was heated uniformly somehow.</p>

How to justify this contradiction in acid-base equilibrium of methanol and water?,"<p>Let's talk about the following compounds - water and methanol. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>We know that <em>methanol is slightly more acidic than water</em>, because water's ability to donate a proton as an acid is reduced due to extensive hydrogen bonding.
The $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a}$ values are approximately $15.5$ and $15.7$, for methanol and water respectively. </p></li>
<li><p>Now consider their conjugate bases, i.e. methoxide ion and hydroxide ion. It is very clear that <em>methoxide is a stronger base compared to hydroxide</em>, due to the +I (inductive) effect of the methyl group (electron releasing).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>How is this possible? Isn't it contradictory?
It is a well known fact that a strong acid has a weak conjugate base, and a weak acid has a strong conjugate base. </p>

<p>This is a consequence of  $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a}$ + $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{b}$ = $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{w}$, where K<sub>w</sub> is the ionic product of water, <em>a constant at a given temperature.</em></p>
",94188,28-03-2018 05:22,Is methanol really more acidic than water?,"<p>The question <a href=""https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/q/42535/27256"">Why is methanol more acidic than water?</a> deals with the reasoning of why methanol is more acidic than water.

<p>So it would seem, water is more acidic than methanol. But an answer to the question mentioned above gives a good reasoning for why methanol is more acidic than water (it doesn't deal with the pKa of water, though). Also, the answer mentions that water would be much worse an acid in DMSO. <a href=""https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/27565/why-is-water-more-acidic-than-alkanols"">Another question</a> implies that methanol and other alcohols are more acidic than water.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is also true that we regard alkoxide ions as being more strongly basic than the hydroxide ion (thus we use them primarily for elimination reactions).</p>

",58451,04-09-2016 08:52,"Is Bond Formation ""Strictly"" Exothermic?","<p>Is bond formation ""strictly"" exothermic? The IUPAC definition of exothermic doesn't make any reference to bond formation. However, I have seen the aforementioned statement before - that bond formation is ""strictly"" exothermic. </p>

<p>I suspect that the answer is ""it depends"" and that ""it depends"" at least on how accurately bonds are characterized. For example, the first reaction below is endothermic, while the second one is exothermic:</p>

<p>$\ce{2NO -&gt; ONNO}$. </p>

<p>$\ce{2NO_2 -&gt; O_2NNO_2}$. </p>

<p>Lewis structure analysis for the first reaction at best misleads because one might suspect the nitric oxide molecule as having a bond order of 2. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TmVbG.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>However, the lone electron is actually delocalized. So the actual $\ce{N-O}$ bond order should be 2.5. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VIaNp.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In the $\ce{ONNO}$ molecule however there is no delocalization of electrons and the bond order of the $\ce{N-O}$ bond is 2. So the $\ce{N-O}$ bond is weakened, and even the formation of the $\ce{N-N}$ bond cannot compensate for this weakening. </p>

<p>Also, the above example reminds me of certain unstable homonuclear species. Such as $\ce{Ne_2}$, which according to MO theory has a bond order of 0 - i.e. there is no bond. So I suppose that bond formation is not always exothermic. On the other hand, if the bond order is 0, is a bond really ""formed""? </p>

Nucleophilicity of halides in solvents,"<p>I have studied that as electronegativity increases nucleophilicity decreases.

There is no effect of the aprotic solvent on anions.</p>

<p>Information given : This causes the most confusion, because it is solvent-dependent. In polar protic solvents (e.g. water and alcohols, any solvent with OH) nucleophilicity increases as you go down the periodic table (F- &lt; Cl- &lt; Br- &lt; I – ).

<p>The reasons given by Solomons and Fryhle<sup>[1]</sup>, and by Wade<sup>[2]</sup> are basically as follows.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Smaller anions are more solvated than bigger ones because of their 'charge to size ratio'. Thus, smaller ions are strongly held by the hydrogen bonds of the solvent.</p></li>
<li><p>Larger atoms/ions are more polarizable. Thus, larger nucleophilic atoms/ions can donate a greater degree of electron density to the substrate than a smaller nucleophile whose electrons are more tightly held. This helps to lower the energy of the transition state.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Clayden et al.<sup>[3]</sup> give the reason that in S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions, the HOMO–LUMO interaction is more important than the electrostatic attraction. The lone pairs of a bigger anion are higher in energy compared to a smaller anion. So, the lone pairs of a bigger anion interact more effectively with the LUMO σ*. Thus, soft nucleophiles react well with saturated carbon.</p>

<p>What I don't understand is the trend of halide nucleophilicity in polar aprotic solvents. </p>

<p>$$\ce{F- &gt; Cl- &gt; Br- &gt; I-}$$</p>

<p>In aprotic solvents, only the solvation factor is absent. Bigger anions are still more polarizable and can interact in a better way with the LUMO. Then, what is the reason for the trend reversal in aprotic solvents? Solomons and Fryhle<sup>[1]</sup> say</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In these[aprotic] solvents anions are unencumbered by a layer of solvent molecules and they are therefore poorly stabilized by solvation. These “naked” anions are highly reactive both as bases and nucleophiles. In DMSO, for example, the relative order of reactivity of halide ions is opposite to that in protic solvents, and it follows the same trend as their relative basicity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Shouldn't the orbital interactions matter more than the electrostatic attractions even in polar aprotic solvents? Why does nucleophilicity follow the basicity trend in polar aprotic solvents?</strong></p>

On what factors does the true reaction Stoichiometry depend when there are multiple valid options?,"<p>Consider the following unbalanced reaction:</p>

Why titrating strong base with weak acid doesn't end at pH 7?,"<p>If I understand this titration correctly, if we titrated 50mL 1.00M acetic acid with 1.00M NaOH, the equivalence point would happen at a pH greater than 7, and less than 50mL of NaOH would need to be used.</p>

<p>The reason I struggle with this is because since the sodium hydroxide is a strong base and will ionize almost entirely, its hydroxide ions will react with whatever hydrogen ions have been ionized from the acetic acid.  This neutralization will force more acetic acid to be ionized, and the process will repeat.  Then, the same volume and molarity of each will be used, and the titration will end with complete neutralization at pH 7.  Why is this not the case?  Can weak acids and bases <strong>not</strong> be forced to ionize in such a way?  Is there some point at which a weak base or acid <strong>will not</strong> ionize any more, no matter what?  </p>

<p>One isomer is green and the other is violet. Why is this so? The ligands are the same, the oxidation state is the same, and so is the coordination number. The only reason I can think of is that if two $\ce{NH3}$ ligands are <em>trans</em> to each other, they repel the 3d orbitals differently than if they were <em>cis</em>. But I don't know why this would occur. </p>

<p>The explanation given in the other question involves anti-bonding orbitals, and I simply have no idea what these are. I'd like an answer which uses highschool chemistry so that I can understand (albeit perhaps in a flawed way ) whats going on.</p>
",74438,13-05-2017 11:17,What is the reason of the color difference for the cis/trans isomers of tetraamminedichloridocobalt(III) chloride?,"<p>The cis and trans isomers of $\ce{[CoCl2(NH3)4]Cl}$ are quite famous as one is purple and the other one is green which is a huge difference in color. Now I can't find any information to why this is the case? </p>

<p>I remember they told me in the lecture on organometallic chemistry when we were discussing substituted carbonylmetallates that a trans-effect occurs where a π-donor trans to the carbonyl (which binds to the metal's d-Orbitals via its antibonding π*-orbitals) increases the electron density in the metal and therefore also increases the the bond's strength ($\ce{M-CO}$) which then changes the bond length. A π-acceptor ligand on the other hand decreases the e-density.</p>

<p>In case of an octahedron the trans isomer would only possess same ligands trans positioned to each other while the cis isomer has mixed ones, too.</p>

<p>But is this the explanation I am looking for or is there another effect I just can't think of right now? </p>

<p>This means that the $\ce{HCl}$ solution has a pH of 9, which seems unreasonable, yet that is not what I said. I said that the meter is <strong>not wrong.</strong> My reasoning was that you could have an $\ce{HCl}$ solution so incredibly dilute that the pH would in fact be 9. Since molarity is defined as moles per liter, if you hold the moles constant and increase the volume of solution, you will eventually reach a very tiny molarity. </p>

<p>In essence what I was wondering was: <strong>Is my reasoning correct?</strong></p>

<p>However, at very low concentrations, this method doesn't work out so well, because water has an amount of auto-ionization, which is described by $K_\mathrm{w} = 10^{-14}$. My old method was just to say that</p>

The proposed mechanism is that one of the electron pairs from the double bond of 1-propene travels to sulfuric acid, de-protonating it. At the next step, water comes in as a nucleophile and attacks the carbocation intermediate - the terminal carbon gets hydrogen added on it because its the carbon with the most hydrogens. We get CH<sub>3</sub>CH(H<sub>2</sub>O)CH<sub>3</sub>. Now water comes in as a nucleophile again and de-protonate a hydrogen to form 2-propanol.</p>

<p>Now when I asked someone on my ship who used to study organic chemistry at a university, she said that she remembered that it was one of the electron pairs from the double bond of 1-propene that travels to H3O<sup>+</sup> instead. </p>

Why do lone pairs of electrons have a higher repulsive force?,"<p>I was just wondering why lone pairs of electrons are more repulsive than bonded pairs of electrons.</p>

<p>I have read that lone pairs have orbitals which are shorter and more round, compared to bonded pairs.

Why do we use external pressure when calculating work done by gas?,"<p>For irreversible expansion and compression, why is d<em>w</em>= -<em>p</em><sub>ext</sub>d<em>V</em> but not d<em>w</em>= -<em>p</em>d<em>V</em> ?</p>

<p>Many of the texts and related questions on this site I encountered give a same general idea: because work done= <strong>opposing</strong> force x displacement. Using this reasoning, I cannot explain my following thought processes:</p>

<p><strong>(a)</strong> In the case of <strong>compression</strong>, the opposing force is obviously caused by <em>p</em> but not <em>p</em><sub>ext</sub>. Based on Atkins' Physical Chemistry Ninth Edition page 50, we use <em>p</em><sub>ext</sub> even for compression.</p>

<p><strong>(b)</strong> The explanation given by Atkins' Physical Chemistry (same page) is: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'when a gas is compressed, the ability of the surroundings to do work
  is diminished by an amount determined by the weight that is lowered,
  and it is this energy that is transferred into the system.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds right. Now if I use this reasoning on <strong>expansion</strong>, </p>

<ol>
<li>Imagine I have two pistons, two filled with different amount of gases at same volume and so different pressure.</li>
<li>Envisage the external pressure being a load resting on the piston. </li>
<li>When both gases expand by the same amount, the work done by both gases, based on the formula d<em>w</em>= -<em>p</em><sub>ext</sub>d<em>V</em> and Atkins' reasoning, are the same. This is because the load moved up by same vertical distance and the changes in volume of gases are the same for two piston.</li>
<li>However, logically, that piston with higher pressure should move faster and so does the load on it. This would mean that, that load actually has higher kinetic energy. </li>
<li>With both gases doing the same amount of work, two loads gain the same gravitational potential energy, but one of the loads gains greater kinetic energy, means that one of the loads actually gain greater amount of total energy. How is this possible?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>(c)</strong>
We always say when <em>p</em>=<em>p</em><sub>ext</sub> during expansion, the work done by the system is maximum, otherwise 'work wasted'. How can you say that it is wasted when the work actually used to increase the kinetic energy of the load as a whole?</p>
",115097,10-05-2019 10:52,Why do we use the external pressure to calculate the work done by gas,"<p>I read in a textbook that in the case when we have a gas in a cylinder fitted with a massless frictionless piston being held with an external pressure <span class=""math-container"">$p_1$</span>, and when the pressure is reduced to become the value <span class=""math-container"">$p_2$</span>, the gas pushes up against the piston and then the work done by the gas for a small change in volume is calculated by: </p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$\mathrm dW=p_2\,\mathrm dV$$</span></p>

<p>Here, is what I don't conceptually understand. If the gas's molecules was under some pressure <span class=""math-container"">$p_1$</span> which is equal to the external pressure in the static state then after the external pressure became lower than the internal pressure, shouldn't the work done by the gas be the difference between the two pressures?</p>

What happens if at equilibrium pressure is increased by decreasing the volume?,"<p>I think, according to Le Châtelier's principle both the conditions i.e. increasing the pressure and decreasing the volume must shift reaction towards the side on which there are less amounts of gaseous molecules. And if there are the same stoichiometric coefficients for the gaseous substances (i.e. <span class=""math-container"">$∆n_g = 0$</span>) then it must not have any effect on the reaction. 
But increasing the pressure and decreasing the volume increases the number of collisions between the molecules of reacting substances and hence the concentration of products must increase. </p>

<p>Both these thoughts confuse me.</p>

<p>Questions I encountered:
<span class=""math-container"">$$ \ce{H2O(g) + CO(g) &lt;=&gt; H2(g) + CO2(g) + Heat }$$</span>
In this question <span class=""math-container"">$∆n_g = 0$</span> so there must be no effect of increasing pressure and decreasing the volume. But the answer mentions that the concentration of both <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{CO}$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{CO2}$</span> will increase.</p>

<p>There was also another question of same type: 
<span class=""math-container"">$$ \ce{SO2Cl2(g) &lt;=&gt; SO2(g) + Cl2(g) }$$</span>
Here the reaction must shift backward as pressure is increased and volume is decreased.
But again the answer mentions that concentration of all the gasses increases. </p>

Is it simply that the two attractive moieties (e.g. a lysine and a glutamate residue) are accelerated towards each other as they convert potential energy into kinetic, and then release heat via collisions with solution molecules?

<p>If the temperature is high enough a long pair of oxygen could break the <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H-H}$</span> (the lone pair will be donated to the <span class=""math-container"">$\sigma^{*}$</span> bond) bond and form <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{2 H-}$</span> (each H gets one electron because of their equal electronegativity). <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H-}$</span> is very unstable and one will immediately react with the empty oxygen orbital, the other will break the <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{O=O}$</span> <span class=""math-container"">$\pi$</span> bond.

Does it sometimes take energy to create a chemical bond?,"<p><a href=""https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> says so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bonds can also be broken apart. Since most bonds require energy to form, they also give off energy when they are broken. But before most bonds break, the molecule has to be heated. Then the atoms start to move, and when they move too much, the bond breaks. Molecules that require less energy to break than they give off when broken are called fuels. For example, a candle will just sit there and nothing happens. But when you use a match to light it, it will burn for a long time. The match brings the energy to break the first bonds, which release enough energy to break the bonds below them, until the candle has burned down.
  But what I have learned is bonds release energy when formed.</p>
</blockquote>
",118911,06-08-2019 08:27,"Is Bond Formation ""Strictly"" Exothermic?","<p>Is bond formation ""strictly"" exothermic? The IUPAC definition of exothermic doesn't make any reference to bond formation. However, I have seen the aforementioned statement before - that bond formation is ""strictly"" exothermic. </p>

<p>I suspect that the answer is ""it depends"" and that ""it depends"" at least on how accurately bonds are characterized. For example, the first reaction below is endothermic, while the second one is exothermic:</p>

<p>$\ce{2NO -&gt; ONNO}$. </p>

<p>$\ce{2NO_2 -&gt; O_2NNO_2}$. </p>

<p>Lewis structure analysis for the first reaction at best misleads because one might suspect the nitric oxide molecule as having a bond order of 2. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TmVbG.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>However, the lone electron is actually delocalized. So the actual $\ce{N-O}$ bond order should be 2.5. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VIaNp.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In the $\ce{ONNO}$ molecule however there is no delocalization of electrons and the bond order of the $\ce{N-O}$ bond is 2. So the $\ce{N-O}$ bond is weakened, and even the formation of the $\ce{N-N}$ bond cannot compensate for this weakening. </p>

<p>Also, the above example reminds me of certain unstable homonuclear species. Such as $\ce{Ne_2}$, which according to MO theory has a bond order of 0 - i.e. there is no bond. So I suppose that bond formation is not always exothermic. On the other hand, if the bond order is 0, is a bond really ""formed""? </p>

What are the chemical principles behind paper/ink deterioration over time and how do I prevent them?,"<p>I have been working on a time capsule for the past few months, in which I decided to not include any electronics (ie: no USB). I am done writing the content of the capsule, but I have some concerns regarding the surface on which it'll be printed and the casing it'll be trapped in.</p>

<p>I know for a fact that all kinds of paper do not age well, and those that do only do so in specific conditions. An example of that would be the old report cards of my parents that have turned yellow-ish and whose paper is surprisingly light and fragile. The ink started disappearing in some areas of the report cards, and left the paper directly under it more damaged than in other, uninked, areas.</p>

<p>These report cards being nearly 40 years old and already slightly damaged, I am quite concerned about leaving printed paper inside a time capsule for decades (if not longer). Since it will most probaby be an encased stack of paper, I am also worried that the pages at the bottom of the stack will get damaged even faster because of the pressure.</p>

<hr>

<p>In this case, a damaged piece of paper means either:</p>

<p>A) The paper has become too fragile to be held with bear hands</p>

<p>B) The ink has disappeared and the paper has become unreadable to human eyes</p>

<p>I have thought of some of the factors that I should probably account for like temperature, material of the casing, oxydation, and humidity, but besides putting the paper in a vacuum (which might not even be that good of an idea), I don't know what to do.</p>

<p>So, my question is: <strong>What are the chemical principles behind the deterioration over time of both ink and paper when put together, and how do I prevent/slow them over long periods of time ?</strong></p>

<p>I have control over these variables:</p>

<ul>
<li>Type of paper*</li>
<li>Type of ink*</li>
<li>The ink can either be printed using a regular/office printer or placed using writing tools</li>
<li>Type of paper coating*</li>
<li>Material of the casing*</li>
<li>Environment surrounding the paper: it could be a vacuumed space or any gas or liquid*</li>
<li>Location of the time capsule: I can place it/burry it anywhere around the world, as long as it is not unrealistically deep or in a militarized zone</li>
</ul>

Are there any exceptions to Le Chatelier’s principle?,"<p>Peter Atkins says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In introductory chemistry, we meet the <strong>empirical rule of thumb</strong> known as  Le Chatelier’s principle:</p>
<p>When a system at equilibrium is subjected to a disturbance, the composition of the system adjusts so as to tend to minimize the effect of the disturbance.</p>
<p>For instance, if a system is compressed, then the equilibrium position can be expected to shift in the direction that leads to a reduction in the number of molecules in the gas phase, for that tends to minimize the effect of compression.<strong>Le Chatelier’s principle, though, is only a rule of thumb, and to understand why reactions respond as they do, and to calculate the new equilibrium composition, we need to use thermodynamics.</strong></p>

Why is the dipole moment of XeF$_6$ zero?,"<p>In <em>Concise Inorganic Chemistry</em> by JD Lee (4th edition; adapted by Sudarshan Guha), page 73 under the section 3.6 (VSEPR Theory chapter Chemical Bonding):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...according to this theory, the position of the lone pair in <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{XeF6}$</span> molecule should be in axial position and the shape should be pentagonal pyramidal. But this is not observed and the actual shape of molecule is octahedral. This implies that the lone pair is placed at equatorial position, and this explains the structure of <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{XeF6}$</span> shown in figures 3.7 a,b,c.</p>
<p>According to Figure 3.7, <span class=""math-container"">$\mu_\text{expected}$</span> for <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{XeF6}$</span> is not equal to zero. But <span class=""math-container"">$\mu_\text{real}(\ce{XeF6})\sim0$</span> . To explain the above facts, it is considered that the actual molecule is in dynamic equilibrium of all the three structures shown in Figure 3.7. Here it is considered that the lone pair is present in the stereochemically active <span class=""math-container"">$s$</span> orbital and similar structure is observed as <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{IF6-}$</span>. But anions like <span class=""math-container"">$[\ce{SbX6}]^{3-}$</span>, <span class=""math-container"">$[\ce{TeX6}]^{2-}$</span> (<span class=""math-container"">$\ce{X}=\ce{Cl, Br, I}$</span>), <span class=""math-container"">$[\ce{BrF6}]^-$</span>,<span class=""math-container"">$[\ce{ICl6}]^-$</span> have been assigned perfectly octahedral structure on the basis of X-ray crystallography and the lone pair is present in stereochemically inactive <span class=""math-container"">$s$</span> orbital.</p>

<p>Snow flakes take on a variety of intricate shapes, but what <em>processes</em> are responsible for this? </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZUviJ.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZUviJ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>(Got the image off of Wikipedia)</p>

<p>I mean, I wouldn't have raised this question if those water droplets, descending towards earth, assumed a... less fancy shape. Not only are these minuscule structures <em>very</em> intricate, they also display a high degree of symmetry (with most having multiple planes of symmetry).</p>

<p>Now, as I understand it, all processes proceed so as to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics"" rel=""noreferrer"">maximize the ""randomness""</a> of its constituent particles. (Oversimplified version of the <em>Second Law of Thermodynamics</em>, yes, I know... just don't chew me out in the comments section...)</p>

<p>This Law can easily be observed in, and verified by, <em>natural</em> processes.</p>

<p>Now the formation of snow <em>is</em> a natural process, agreed? The way <em>my</em> brain sees it, is that water droplets ought to freeze into <em>random</em>, and by virtue of its ""randomness"", highly unsymmetrical shapes. But this is <strong>not</strong> the case here!</p>

<p>For <em>some</em> confounded reason, the shapes assumed by snowflakes are eerily symmetrical. So eerie, that I'm surprised it hasn't attracted the attention of conspiracy theorists yet, as in the case of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_circle"" rel=""noreferrer"">crop circles</a>. Now I'm not saying you don't find symmetry in nature, there're plenty of examples out there. But what I <em>am</em> trying to point out here, is that you don't typically see symmetry to such a high extent as in the case of snowflakes.</p>

<p>There are innumerable natural processes that give rise to weird shaped stuff, but I'm not really sure what makes snowflakes so different. However, I did notice a few points of difference between the formation of snowflakes and <em>other</em> natural processes:</p>

<p>1) As water droplets/snow descends, it's subjected to significant temperature changes as it passes through different layers of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>2) As water droplets/snow descends, it's subject to a significant increase in pressure as it passes through different layers of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>So, I reiterate my question.</p>

<p>I heard (not sure where) that each snowflake assumes a <em>unique</em> shape. How true is this?</p>

How is the temperature in which vapor pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure the boiling point of the liquid?,"<p>I was just learning about vapor pressure and got very confused. Vapor pressure was defined as the pressure exerted by a vapor in thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed phases at a given temperature in a closed system, which was the pressure the vapor exerts on the closed container when it reaches the dynamic equilibrium. However, this is merely a calculation AFTER it reaches equilibrium, and I don't understand how vapor pressure can also be interpreted as the measure of the tendency of a material to change into the vapor state. Also, if it is the lack of enough vapor pressure, or &quot;tendency of the liquid to change to vapor&quot; compared to the atmospheric pressure that's keeping the liquid from vaporizing, how can evaporation occur with lower pressure than the atmospheric pressure(because if the vapor pressure is higher than atmospheric pressure it is already boiling), since evaporation is supposed to be the molecules on the surface of the liquid randomly gaining enough energy to overcome the atmospheric pressure, implying that it has greater pressure than the atmosphere. I feel like I am overthinking the topic, but I didn't just want to give up thinking about it, so please help if possible!</p>

What's with the weird definition for the Calorie?,"<p>I came across this definition for the calorie, which I found... strange:</p>

<p>""<em>The (15°) calorie is the heat required to raise the temperature of one gram of water from 14.5°C to 15.5°C.</em>""</p>

<p>Subsequent searches on-line revealed that this was (one of) the <em>standard</em> definitions for the Calorie.</p>

<p>Now two issues came to my mind after I read that definition:</p>

<p>1) <strong>Why is the term '<em>heat</em>' and not '<em>energy</em>' used?</strong> </p>

<p>From what I recall from my Thermodynamics classes at school last year, <em>heat</em> is energy in <em>transit</em>. I'm under the impression 'heat' is more of a 'surface phenomenon' if you will; there's 'heat' at the junction between two surfaces, but no matter how much you 'heat' up a body it can never <em>contain</em> heat (strictly speaking).</p>

<p>2) <strong>What's so special about the 14.5°C and the 15.5°C range?</strong></p>

<p>Seriously, <em>why</em> that particular range? Why not 0°C to 1°C, or even 1°C to 2°C? Heck even 14°C to 15°C would go down (mildly) well with me, but 14 <strong>.5</strong> °C to 15 <strong>.5</strong> °C? What's with the inordinate fondness for the 0.5°C? A 1°C difference is a 1°C difference in temperature, so why specify <em>any</em> range <em>at all</em>? Why not define the calorie as '<em>The energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by 1°C</em>' ?</p>

<p>I didn't have this question before because I, for all practical purposes, only used to see the calorie as being roughly equal to 4.19 Joules.</p>

<p>Would anyone happen to have the answer to those two queries?</p>

<p>I've already seen <a href=""https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/60321/why-a-specific-temperature-for-value-of-1-calorie"">this</a> particular question, and I believe it is necessary to state that <strong>this does NOT answer <em>my</em> question</strong>.

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wpWRH.png""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wpWRH.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Now, I appreciate the book went on to mention <em>this</em> particular compound (I didn't know that organic molecules could be shaped like...well...a basket, so I find this interesting) but the problem is, that it didn't mention basketane's IUPAC nomenclature, much less <em>how</em> to go about naming it.</p>

<p>A quick internet search reveals the following IUPAC name for basketane:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pentacyclo[$4.4.0$.$\mathrm{0^{2,5}}$.$\mathrm{0^{3,8}}$.$\mathrm{0^{4,7}}$]decane</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I'm still having trouble finding out <em>how</em> people even arrived at this name. Heck, I don't even know if the above mentioned name is even <em>correct</em>. I consulted all my Org. Chem books, and predictably, there was no mention of how to even <em>begin</em> naming basketane. I'm still in high school, so this particular kind of nomenclature is still alien to me (I haven't dealt with any super-scripts or carbons assigned the locant: zero yet).</p>

<p>Would anyone be able to:</p>

<p>1) Validate that name I've come across</p>

<p>2) Explain (citing a decent reference will do as well) how I ought to go about even naming this thing.</p>

Why some hydrates are coloured while other are not,"<p>I was studying about different vitriol and noticed that some hydrates are coloured while some are colourless even after having water in their crystals.</p>

When we come to zinc sulfate,it has no colour in all of its three hydrates (the most common one being the heptahydrate).</p>

Particle in a box models for polyenes and quantum dots,"<p>I'm kind of new to physical chemistry and trying to understand how, if at all, the correspondence principle (in the limit of large quantum numbers, quantum mechanics reproduces classical behavior of a system) relates to transition energies for electronic excitement in conjugated polyenes and quantum dots. </p>

<p>Our experiment used UV/vis spec to measure absorption and calculated theoretical values of energy with the particle in a box/sphere models. So why does the difference between experimental and theoretical energy get larger as length gets smaller? </p>

<p>Someone proposed the correspondence principle here, but I don't see how that has to do with going from the ground state (HOMO or valence band) state to the first excited state (LUMO or conduction band) that we're dealing with in the experiment. What am I not understanding here? Thank you!</p>

<p>$L$ is given as 11.84 angstroms.</p>

<p>Also how does this even make sense? As conjugation increases the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO should decrease. With this relationship as $N$ increases as does the energy gap. To me it makes no sense, how can it be explained?</p>

For the carbon: In any isothermal process $dG=VdP$, let's assume for our ideal solid that the volume is constant (I have also tried this in a model where the volume changes with pressure with bulk moduli, the result does not differ significantly), so $\Delta G=V(P-P_o)$.</p>

<p>II. Here simply $\Delta G=\Delta G^o_r$.</p>

<p>III. Here it's just gas compressing so again $\Delta G=RT\ln (P/P_o)$</p>

<p>Adding the contributions from all three stages we have
$$
\Delta G=RT\ln (1/(P/P_o))+V(P-P_o)+\Delta G^o_r+RT\ln (P/P_o)=\Delta G^o_r+V(P-P_o)
$$</p>

<p>This result is different from what a model of an activity of unity for the carbon would predict. What went wrong? And why are activities of solids and liquids taken to be unity? Any help will be appreciated.</p>

"Balancing chemical reactions, issues of Gauss's elimination method","<p>I am trying to balance some chemical reactions by using the Gauss' elimination method and I noticed that this method does not work if the creation of a matrix with exactly one degree of freedom is not possible.</p>

How do scientists study liquid tungsten?,"<p>Inspired by this What If article: <a href=""https://what-if.xkcd.com/50/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://what-if.xkcd.com/50/</a></p>

<p>In the above article, Randall Munroe mentions that liquid tungsten is difficult to study because of its extremely high melting point. Because of this property, containers for the tungsten tend to melt before the metal itself. This might be a fairly elementary question, but given this difficulty, what methods do modern chemists use to study it, or other materials with extreme melting points?</p>

During this time a very odd question came to me. I was wondering what the furnace was made of. My logic stated that whatever the furnace was made of must have a higher melting point than the materials he was melting. This quickly turned into an elemental arms race resulting in an odd question of how do we melt stuff like refractory metals (more specifically the one with the highest melting point) so we can melt other things inside of it. </p>

<p>Now I know that (for some odd reason I don't understand) rapid cooling can manipulate the strength of an item. Is there a similar property to manipulate the melting point? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Lucas test in alcohols is a test to differentiate between primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols. It is based on the differences in reactivity of the three classes of alcohols with hydrogen halides via an <span class=""math-container"">$\mathrm{S_N1}$</span> reaction:</p>
<p><span class=""math-container"">$$\ce{ROH + HCl -&gt; RCl + H2O}$$</span></p>
<p>The differing reactivity reflects the differing ease of formation of the corresponding carbocations. Tertiary carbocations are far more stable than secondary carbocations, and primary carbocations are the least stable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So since alkyl halides are insoluble, they give a turbid solution upon formation, which easily happens for tertiary alcohols.</p>

I have a doubt with a particular statement in the book. It says that Grignard reagents do not displace halides as easily as acetylide ions do.</p>

<p>But shouldn’t it be the other way round? Acetylide ions, having an sp-hybridised carbon, are much more electronegative compared to the sp³-hybridised carbon in Grignard reagents. So acetylide ions should have less tendency to displace halide ions by attacking with their lone pair compared to the alkyl group in Grignard reagent. Shouldn’t it?</p>

<p>Please help me sort this out!

<p>What I'm really looking for is <strong>why</strong> the d orbital is more stable this way. I assume it has to do with distributing the negative charge of the electrons as evenly as possible around the nucleus since each orbital of the d subshell is in a slightly different location, leading to a more positive charge in the last empty or half-filled d orbital. Putting the final electron in the s orbital would create a more negative charge around the atom as a whole, but still leave that positive spot empty.</p>

<p><strong>Why does this not happen with the other columns as well?</strong> Does this extra stability work with all half or completely filled orbitals, except columns 6 and 11 are the only cases where the difference is strong enough to 'pull' an electron from the s orbital? It seems like fluorine would have a tendency to do do this as well, so I suppose the positive gap left in the unfilled p orbital isn't strong enough to remove an electron from the lower 2s orbital.</p>

Why must polar molecules be asymetrical?,"<p>As I understand, polarity in molecules comes from the difference in electronegativity or the ability of the atoms to attract eletrons so the electrons spend more time or are more probable to gravitate more around the atom with stronger electronegativity right? So I wonder why polar molecules must necessarily have an asymetrical structure? (as I've read on multiple sites). Shouldn't a symetrical atom with strong electronegativity with 2 atoms bonded linearly 180° on both sides which are significantly less electronegative, be polar since the electrons would gravitate more towards the center and the sides would then be more positively charged?

<p>Why is the first molecule (1) not possible? Is it becuase of the less polar atom on the left side repells electrons just as much as the one on the right? But then the electrons would still orbit the middle atom more because its more elctronegative, right?</p>

Dependency of rate of diffusion on mean free path and velocity of molecules?,"<p>What is the dependency of rate of diffusion ( Graham's law) on mean free path, molecular size , average velocity, collision frequency and pressure?

",100719,18-08-2018 14:17,Why does gas particle velocity affect rate of effusion?,"<p>I understand why smaller particles have more velocity, but I don't understand what velocity has to do with rate of effusion:</p>

<p>My reasoning is thus:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pressure is the number of impacts of particles in a given period of time.</p></li>
<li><p>If He and Ar are both in balloons at, say, 1.5 atm, both gasses have the same average Kinetic energy but He is moving faster (because it's smaller). Simple enough.</p></li>
<li><p>If both gasses are subject to the same pressure, they have the same number of impacts over a given area over a given period in time.</p></li>
<li><p>This should mean that each gas has an equal number of particles approaching a hole over a given period of time.</p></li>
<li><p>If a hole is big enough for both particles to fit through, the rate of effusion should be the same, since the same number of particles are approaching the exit hole.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For an analogy to explain my thinking ... if you have two lanes of cars going through a checkpoint, one has 30 cars per minute at 50 miles per hour and one has 30 cars per minute at 30 miles per hour, the resulting number of cars through the checkpoint should still be 30 cars per minute in each lane, regardless of their velocity.</p>

<p>My book (and professor, and Wikipedia...) say that it is the higher velocity of He particles which cause the faster rate of effusion; however, from my reasoning, that doesn't make sense except with small enough holes where the size of the particles would have an effect, i.e. the holes are very small in size and He could fit through but Ar could not, or there are simply <em>more</em> holes that He could fit through.</p>

<p>But Graham's law is referring to pinholes, which should be large enough for either atom to fit through.</p>

<p>So why does velocity affect rate of effusion?</p>

Electron shells and subshells energies,"<p>According to what i learned in university, the energy of orbitals increases when the principal quantum number n increases. Also, in a given shell, s orbitals have lower energy than p orbitals which have lower energy than d orbitals, which in turn have lower energy than f orbitals.</p>

<p>And according to Aufbau principle: ""Electrons fill lowest energy orbitals first.""</p>

<p>But when we write the electron configuration of atoms, it goes as follows:
1s 2s 2p 3s 3p 4s 3d 4p 5s 4d 5p 6s 4f 5d 6p 7s 5f 6d 7p</p>

Why are the equilibrium exponents stoichiometric when the rate law's are not?,"<p>I'm learning about rate law and equilibrium, and the textbook really hammers in that the exponents for the rate law must be determined experimentally - you can't just use the coefficients from the balanced equation. In a generic reaction aA + bB -> cC + dD:</p>

<p>r<sub>f</sub> = k<sub>f</sub>[A]<sup>w</sup>[B]<sup>x</sup></p>

<p>r<sub>r</sub> = k<sub>r</sub>[C]<sup>y</sup>[D]<sup>z</sup></p>

<p>It is not always the case that w = a, x = b etc.</p>

<p>Equilibrium is then described as the point that the forward reaction is occurring at the same rate as the reverse reaction. For the same reaction as above, we set the two rates to equal each other.</p>

<p>r<sub>f</sub> = r<sub>r</sub></p>

<p>k<sub>f</sub>[A]<sup>w</sup>[B]<sup>x</sup> = k<sub>r</sub>[C]<sup>y</sup>[D]<sup>z</sup></p>

<p>K<sub>c</sub> = k<sub>f</sub> / k<sub>r</sub> = [C]<sup>y</sup>[D]<sup>z</sup> / [A]<sup>w</sup>[B]<sup>x</sup></p>

<p>I'm told that the exponents here are based on the coefficients of the balanced equation, such that w = a, x = b, y = c, and z = d. This seems to be in direct opposition to what I read earlier about the rate law, as equilibrium is just built from two rates. </p>

<p>My doubt is, fluorine being the most electronegative element exerts a greater negative inductive effect (compared to that of chlorine) which stabilises the conjugate base formed. So I feel trifluoromethane must be more acidic than trichloromethane. But the reverse order is observed. </p>

",119555,24-08-2019 13:14,Which molecule is more acidic: CHF3 or CHBr3?,"<p>I know that fluorine is more electronegative than bromine. However, because of the size of bromine, it is more stable with a negative charge. In the case of $\ce{HF}$ vs. $\ce{HBr}$, to me, $\ce{HBr}$ is without a doubt the stronger acid. When it comes to comparing $\ce{CHF3}$ with $\ce{CHBr3}$, we are supposed to compare the stability of their conjugate bases. </p>

<p>In $\ce{CF3^-}$, the fluorine can hold the electronegative charge quite well. It also exerts a strong inductive effect.   </p>

<p>In $\ce{CBr3^-}$, the bromine is less electronegative than the fluorine but is more polarizable, so I think it can hold the negative charge more efficiently. </p>

<p>With this understanding, I am concluding that $\ce{CBr3^-}$ is more stable which would mean $\ce{CHBr3}$ is the stronger acid. However, I've been told otherwise. </p>

<p>I'm aware that the $\ce{C-Br}$ bond length is longer than the $\ce{C-F}$ bond length. I'm wondering if that short bond length causes $\ce{CF3^-}$ to be more stable than $\ce{CBr3^-}$. If this is true, is it okay for me to think about $\ce{CF3^-}$ dissociating vs. $\ce{CBr3^-}$ dissociating? In that scenario, I believe $\ce{CBr3^-}$ dissociates more easily than $\ce{CF3^-}$, meaning $\ce{CF3-}$ is more stable. </p>

<p>Note: This logic wouldn't apply to the instance of $\ce{HO-}$ vs. $\ce{HS-}$ because $\ce{HS-}$ is more stable than $\ce{HO-}$ (even though $\ce{H-O}$ bond length is shorter than $\ce{H-S}$ bond length).</p>

The bond angle is reduced from ideal <span class=""math-container"">$120°$</span> to <span class=""math-container"">$119°30'$</span> because of the repulsion by the lone pair of electrons.

<p>Phosphorus (<sub>15</sub>P) - being the fifteenth element - has fifteen electrons, five valence electrons and the following electron configuration:</p>

2s<sup>2</sup> 2p<sup>6</sup><br />

<p>This being so, by what means does it form its bonds? Naively, one might expect it to form 3 single covalent bonds and be happy. But it doesn't, it forms five bonds, presumably using each of its five electrons. My first question is - why would it do this? It seems to me that this would result in the Phosphorus atom having ten electrons in its outer shell (four from the double bond with the oxygen and two each from the single bonds with the other three oxygens).</p>

<p>Apart from the oxygen with a double-bond, we have three oxygens forming single bonds. Does this not leave them one electron short?</p>

<p>Finally, why are the oxygens shown as carrying a negative charge?</p>

If this rotation is due to the assymetry around the bond, the different molecules are oriented in all possible directions(randomly) and hence the light will fall on them in all different orientations, and should ultimately be undeflected since for every orientation of the molecule, we can reverse the orientation such that the light appears to be falling on the molecule from a direction other than the one for our original molecule.<br>

For a single given sample, the relative atomic mass of a given element is the weighted arithmetic mean of the masses of the individual atoms (including their isotopes)
so standard atomic weight = relative atomic weight</p>
<p>But at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_atomic_mass#Standard_atomic_weight#Definition"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_atomic_mass#Standard_atomic_weight#Definition</a> it says:</p>
<p>It is a synonym for atomic weight, though it is not to be confused with relative isotopic mass. Relative atomic mass is also frequently used as a synonym for standard atomic weight and these quantities may have overlapping values if the relative atomic mass used is that for an element from Earth under defined conditions. However, relative atomic mass (atomic weight) is still technically distinct from standard atomic weight because of its application only to the atoms obtained from a single sample; \textbf{it is also not restricted to terrestrial samples, whereas standard atomic weight averages multiple samples but only from terrestrial sources}</p>
<p>I am told <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_atomic_weight"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> that:</p>
<p>The standard atomic weight (Ar, standard) of a chemical element is the weighted arithmetic mean of the relative atomic masses (Ar) of all isotopes of that element weighted by each isotope's abundance on Earth.</p>

<p>Atomic mass (ma) is the mass of an atom. A single atom has a set number of protons and neutrons, so the mass is unequivocal (won't change) and is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the atom.</p>
<p>Atomic weight is a weighted average of the mass of all the atoms of an element, based on the abundance of isotopes. The atomic weight can change because it depends on our understanding of how much of each isotope of an element exists.</p>

Atomic weight = standard atomic weight</p>

What is the exact statement of Drago's rule?,"<p>While studying the topic of chemical bonding, I came across a statement given by my teacher:

An example, in the case of <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{PH_3}$</span>, <span class=""math-container"">$99.9$</span>% s-character exists in the lone pair due to <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{P-H}$</span> bonds being weaker.</p>
<p>Is this the exact statement of Drago's rule? On various other sources, I have found conflicting views, some say that hybridization actually exists and the actual statement is different, the one being taught to students is wrong.</p>

",136957,24-07-2020 09:11,What is Drago's rule? Does it really exist?,"<p>My textbooks states the <strong>Drago's rule</strong> in inorganic chemistry as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The more electronegative atom prefers the orbital having more p
  character, and lone-pairs or less electronegative elements prefer such
  orbitals, as have more s character.</p>
  
  <p>Now, according to hybridization, $\mathrm{sp^3d = sp^2 + pd}$,
  $\mathrm{sp^3d^2 = sp + p^2d^2}$, $\mathrm{sp^3d^3 = sp + p^2d^3}$ </p>
  
  <p>So, in $\mathrm{sp^3d}$ more electronegative elements like Fluorine go
  to axial position, but such elements go to equatorial position in
  $\mathrm{sp^3d^2}$ or $\mathrm{sp^3d^3}$.</p>
  
  <p>Also, as a result of Drago's effect when atoms of group $14, 15$ and
  $16$ (belonging to third period and above) are attached to atoms having Electronegativity less than
  $2.5$ then it has valence electrons in pure s-orbitals. And apparently
  no hybridization effect is observed in such cases. That is why in
  $\ce{NH3}$ the bond angles are $107.8^\circ$ but for
  $\ce{PH3},\ce{AsH3},\ce{SbH3},\ce{BiH3}$ the bond angles are very
  close to $90^\circ$.</p>

  $\mathrm{sp^3d^2 = sp + p^2d^2}$, $\mathrm{sp^3d^3 = sp + p^2d^3}$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does it mean that the hybridized orbitals split in this way? If so, why should they split?</p></li>
<li><p>Why would the more electronegative atom prefer the orbital with more p character?</p></li>
<li><p>Even if Drago's rule holds, why is the statement in the paragraph beginning with ""Also, as a result of Drago's effect when atoms …"" true? I could not understand why the same won't occur for atoms with electronegativity $&gt;2.5$.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>I could not find much information regarding Drago's rule on the internet. Not even on Wikipedia. One of my acquaintances (who is a chemist) said that no such rule exists. But I didn't get much time to discuss the matter with him. </p>

<p>In the $\ce{ONNO}$ molecule however there is no delocalization of electrons and the bond order of the $\ce{N-O}$ bond is 2. So the $\ce{N-O}$ bond is weakened, and even the formation of the $\ce{N-N}$ bond cannot compensate for this weakening. </p>

<p>Also, the above example reminds me of certain unstable homonuclear species. Such as $\ce{Ne_2}$, which according to MO theory has a bond order of 0 - i.e. there is no bond.

Is nitrogen with 3 different substituents and lone pair a chiral center? Does it make the whole compound chiral too?,"<p>Is nitrogen considered a chiral centre or stereocenter when it has three different substituents attached to it along with a lone pair.</p>
<p>By definition LG Wade says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An  asymmetric  carbon  atom  is  the  most  common  example  of  a  chiral  center  (or chirality  center),  the  IUPAC  term  for  any  atom  holding  a  set  of  ligands  in  a  spatial arrangement  that  is  not  superimposable  on  its  mirror  image.  Chiral  centers  belong  to an  even  broader  group  called  stereocenters.  A  stereocenter  (or  stereogenic  atom)  is any  atom  at  which  the  interchange  of  two  groups  gives  a  stereoisomer.*  Asymmetric carbons  and  the  double-bonded  carbon  atoms  in  cis-trans  isomers  are  the  most  common types of stereocenters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So by the definition of chiral centre and stereo center , if here I interchange two of the substituents then I get a non super-imposable structure which is the mirror image of original compound. Sure, it can undergo inversion, but the definition only says about non super-imposability of mirror image and getting a new stereoisomer on interchanging 2 substituents.</p>
<p>Also if we are calling the nitrogen as chiral centre will be also called the compound to be chiral??</p>
<p><a href=""https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/50106/can-heteroatoms-with-lone-pairs-be-chiral-centres/50109"">Here</a> The answer says it can only be chiral if we slow down the inversion... But the definition doesn't have any condition about how fast the inversion is , it's just checking super-imposability of mirror images</p>
<p>Note : I'm not just asking about the compound being chiral, but the chiral center. Kind of like (R,S)-2,3 dichloro butane is not chiral molecule, but has a chiral center.
It's not a duplicate as by definition of IUPAC Chiral center is the term for any atom holding a set of ligands in a spatial arrangement that is not superimposable on its mirror image. They don't talk about how fast the inversion is at all</p>

How to calculate the pH of solutions of amphoteric salts?,"<p>I've been trying to understand how to calculate <strong>the pH of solutions of amphoteric salts</strong>, but I just can't figure it out. So, I've seen that it is commonly explained like this (example for a solution of NaH2PO4):</p>
<p>The salt completely dissociates like so <br/>
<span class=""math-container"">$\ce{NaH2PO4}$</span>--&gt;<span class=""math-container"">$\ce{Na+}$</span> + <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H2PO4-}$</span></p>
<p>Then the H2PO4- ion reacts with water to form HPO4 2- and H3O+.  (reaction 1)<br />
<span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H2PO4-}$</span> + <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H2O}$</span> &lt;=&gt; <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{HPO4  2-}$</span> + <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H3O+}$</span> _______   <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{Ka2=6.2 x 10^{-8}}$</span></p>
<p>And then it reacts with H3O+ to form H3PO4 and H2O.  (reaction 2)<br />
<span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H2PO4-}$</span> + <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H3O+}$</span> &lt;=&gt; <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H3PO4}$</span> + <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H2O}$</span>   ________   <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{K=Ka1^{-1}, Ka1=7.52*10^{-3}}$</span></p>
<p><strong>The autoionization of water is negligible.</strong></p>
<p>Now, I imagine this process like this:<br />
The concentration of the <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H2PO4-}$</span> ion in the first reaction is equal to the concentration of the salt in the solution because the salt dissociates completely. As it reacts with <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H2O}$</span> to form <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{HPO4 2-}$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H3O+}$</span> (reaction 1), its concentration decreases for a certain value of x. The equilibrium concentration of <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H3O+}$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{HPO4 2-}$</span> <strong>in this reaction</strong> are the same and equal x. The equilibrium concentration of <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H2PO4-}$</span> is equal to the concentration of the salt minus x.</p>
<p><span class=""math-container"">$\ce{[H2PO4-]1=c(salt)-x}$</span><br />
<span class=""math-container"">$\ce{[H3O+]1=x}$</span><br />
<span class=""math-container"">$\ce{[HPO4 2-]=x}$</span></p>
<p><span class=""math-container"">$\ce{Ka2=\frac{[H3O+]1*[HPO4 2-] }{[H2PO4-]1}}$</span></p>
<p>Then, what is left of the <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H2PO4-}$</span>, that is the equilibrium concentration of <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H2PO4-}$</span> from the first reaction reacts with the equilibrium concentration of  <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H3O+}$</span> from the first reaction to form <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H3PO4}$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H2O}$</span>. The concentrations of <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H2PO4-}$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H3O+}$</span> decrease for a certain value of y. So, in the equilibrium of this reaction, reaction 2, the equilibirum concentration of <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H3PO4}$</span> will equal to y.</p>
<p><span class=""math-container"">$\ce{[H2PO4-]2=[H2PO4-]1-y=c(salt)-x-y}$</span><br />
<span class=""math-container"">$\ce{[H3O+]2=[H3O+]1-y=x-y}$</span><br />
<span class=""math-container"">$\ce{[H3PO4]=y}$</span></p>
<p><span class=""math-container"">$\ce{Ka1^{-1}=\frac{[H3PO4] }{[H2PO4-]2*[H3O+]2}}$</span></p>
<p>So the final concentration of <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H3O+}$</span> is equal to the concentration of <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H3O+}$</span> in the equilibrium of the second reaction.</p>
<p><span class=""math-container"">$\ce{[H3O+]final=[H3O+]2}$</span></p>
<p>We can see that the final concentration of <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H3O+}$</span> is equal to x-y. Because <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{[HPO4 2-]=x}$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{[H3PO4]=y}$</span>, we write:</p>
<p><span class=""math-container"">$\ce{[H3O+]final=[HPO4 2-]-[H3PO4]}$</span></p>
<p>We can express <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{[HPO4 2-]}$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{[H3PO4]}$</span> using the equilibrium constants, concentrations of <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H3O+}$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H2PO4-}$</span>.</p>
<p><span class=""math-container"">$\ce{[H3O+]final=\frac{Ka2*[H2PO4-]1 }{[H3O+]1}-\frac{[H2PO4-]2*[H3O+]final }{Ka1}}$</span></p>
<p>If we assume that the initial concentration of <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H2PO4-}$</span> is so large that the change of x and y are negligible, we can write that:</p>
<p><span class=""math-container"">$\ce{[H2PO4-]2=[H2PO4-]1=c(salt)}$</span></p>
<p>If we assume that the concentration of <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H3O+}$</span> is large enough so that the change of y is negligible, we can write:</p>
<p><span class=""math-container"">$\ce{[H3O+]final=[H3O+]1}$</span></p>
<p>With those assumptions we can get this commonly used expression for explaining this problem</p>
<p><span class=""math-container"">$\ce{[H3O+]final=\frac{Ka2*c(salt)}{[H3O+]final}-\frac{c(salt)*[H3O+]final }{Ka1}}$</span></p>
<p>and with a little bit of rearranging, we get this expression:</p>
<p><span class=""math-container"">$\ce{[H3O+]final=\sqrt{\frac{Ka2 * c(salt)}{1+\frac{c(salt)}{Ka1}}}}$</span></p>
<p>What I don't understand is the fact that we were able to get the last equation because we assumed that the final concentration of <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H3O+}$</span> ions <strong>is equal</strong> to their concentration in the equilibrium of the first reaction. But at the beginning, when we established the first equation for the final concentration of <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H3O+}$</span>, we assumed that the concentrations of <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H3O+}$</span> ions in the equilibrium of the first and second(final) reaction <strong>aren't equal</strong>. If in the end we assumed they are equal, why can't we calculate the pH just using the first reaction? That way the <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{H2PO4-}$</span> wouldn't be treated as an amphoteric, which obviously isn't correct, so I'm wondering what is wrong in my approach?</p>

Carbon is more electronegative than hydrogen, therefore, carbon should be able to better withdraw electron density via induction from the $\ce{O}$. This is a stabilizing interaction.</p>

<p>We often think of methyl groups as inductively donating, but that's molecular profiling. They can inductively donate to a carbocation, partly because a carbocation is highly electronegative, so the carbocation pulls the electrons toward itself pretty well (so there's both pushing and pulling of electrons going on). When you have a methyl group attached to an $\ce{O}$, however, the methyl group is often inductively withdrawing. NMR data supports this.</p>

<p>Now the question is why aren't other aliphatic alcohols more acidic than water? In longer-chain aliphatic alkoxides, you don't just have a methyl group attached to the $\ce{O}$ bearing the negative charge - you have a bunch of methyl groups strung together. These lessen the amount of inductive withdrawal that the alpha carbon can do. Each$\ce{-CH2 -}$ unit attached to the alpha $\ce{-CH2 -}$ is somewhat inductive donating to the alpha $\ce{-CH2 -}$.</p>

How to determine the order of acidity of the following dimethyl nitrophenols,"<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JA54p.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This is how I went about it, although I got a wrong answer:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>3,5-Dimethyl-4-nitrophenol (2) shows the nitro group to be sterically hindered, due to which it should go out of plane and this will be an example of the steric inhibition of resonance. Hence, there will only be a weak withdrawing inductive effect, and no resonance. Thus, this should be the least acidic.</p></li>
<li><p>4,5-Dimethyl-2-nitrophenol (3) shows a hydrogen bonding between the nitro and the hydroxyl group, due to which there will be a lower tendency to release the proton. Hence, even this should be less acidic.</p></li>
<li><p>Between 2,6-dimethyl-3-nitrophenol (1) and 2,4-dimethyl-5-nitrophenol (4), (1) should be weakly acidic due to the hyperconjugation destabilisation caused by the two methyl groups, and hence the answer should be (4), with lower hyperconjugation, lower induction from the methyl groups, and higher induction from the nitro group (no resonance at the meta position).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>However, the answer is given to be (2), which I ruled out first.</p>

<p>Can someone please explain what is happening, and where I've gone wrong?</p>
",97659,30-05-2018 07:32,Acidity order of nitrophenols,"<p>As in other posts I have seen and learnt that, if one is given four compounds, namely <em>para</em>-nitrophenol, <em>ortho</em>-nitrophenol, <em>meta</em>-nitrophenol and phenol and is told to arrange them in order of acidity, then one has to take into account the <span class=""math-container"">$\text{-R}$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$\text{-I}$</span> effect.</p>

<p>Now, for the inductive effect, the greatest intensity is observed at the <em>ortho</em>-position, followed by <em>meta</em>-, and then <em>para</em>-.     </p>

<p>For the resonating effect, the intensity is greatest for <em>para</em> and lowest for <em>ortho</em>, while <em>meta</em> has no such effect. Now keeping in mind, that <span class=""math-container"">$\text{-R}$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$\text{-I}$</span> both tend to withdraw electrons away from the phenol group (and thus increases the acidity), and the <span class=""math-container"">$\text{R}$</span> effect has more contribution than the <span class=""math-container"">$\text{I}$</span> effect, we can thus deduce that <em>para</em>-nitrophenol is most acidic, followed by <em>ortho</em>-nitrophenol, then <em>meta</em>-nitrophenol and since phenol has no ring activating group, it comes out to be least acidic in the given compounds.</p>

<p>The facts are the proof of my theory, where the <span class=""math-container"">$\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a}$</span> for: 
<span class=""math-container"">$$
\begin{array}{c|c}  
\text{Compound} &amp; \mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a} \\

 \text{phenol}   &amp; 9.95 
\end{array}  
$$</span></p>

<p>So far so good.  </p>

<p>But one of my colleagues, when I asked the problem, tried to give the theory in different way. He said, in <em>para</em>-nitrophenol, hydrogen bonding is strongest, so it can't be most acidic, which in his view port should be least. I knew this is not the case, but I just can't explain or point out where he's been wrong. Can anyone of you make it little easy for me to understand it?</p>

<p>I'm aware that there might be concepts in physics here I don't know or understand to understand a possible answer, and I would be thankful for any pointers to what subjects I should be first reading to understand such an answer.</p>

<p>Edit: I would like to quote here something I came across on wikipedia. I'm not providing it as an answer nor claiming it is correct, just trying to illustrate how <em>confusing</em> it is to find a satisfying answer for this matter. This comes from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond#Overview_of_main_types_of_chemical_bonds"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond#Overview_of_main_types_of_chemical_bonds</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the simplest view of a covalent bond, one or more electrons (often a pair of electrons) are drawn into the space between the two atomic nuclei. Energy is released by bond formation. This is not as a reduction in potential energy <em>(sic)</em>, because the attraction of the two electrons to the two protons is offset by the electron-electron and proton-proton repulsions. Instead, the release of energy (and hence stability of the bond) arises from the <strong>reduction in kinetic energy</strong> due to the electrons being in a more spatially distributed (i.e. longer de Broglie wavelength) orbital compared with each electron being confined closer to its respective nucleus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Italic and bold added by me. Note that wikipedia itself has a '[clarification needed]' tagging in the middle of that text, right after 'two protons', which I removed.</p>

<p>So if I understand <em>that</em> correctly and assuming that info is correct, any formation of a covalent bond would result in energy being released. But that still doesn't explain why my book is claiming the energy is particularly stored in carbon (and not in oxygen), and why it is released as warmth. In addition, the explanation on wikipedia would contradict what I referred to earlier, namely that the energy released comes from differences in bond potential energy.</p>

Electron has volume or not?,"<p>Sometimes we say that electron has volume, as in orbital we can define it's volume (at least for some fraction, as orbital itself has no limit, it is spread all over the space expect nodes).</p>

<p>On other hand in general chemistry books often spin quantum no. is referred as electron spinning on its axis. But this is absurd, because this magnetic angular momentum is an intrinsic property of the electron. Also that an electron is an elementary particle, it is 1-D (no volume), so it's not possible for an electron to spin on it's own axis. </p>

<p>So what's the matter, do electron has volume or not?</p>

<p>What I think that it's a particle, but we can't describe it's position what we can do is probabilistic approach, we can only describe some region where we can find it more likely or less likely. We defined it's volume, otherwise electron themselves has no volume. Even it is more weird that electron is everywhere in the orbital ;D</p>

",98513,19-06-2018 20:45,Trying to understand the statement: 'Resonance is not a flickering between the contributing states. ',"<p>So, the famous resonance definition: <em>it is the weighted average of different Lewis structures....</em></p>
<p>Well, this is purely wrong.</p>
<p>Resonance is nothing but quantum '<em>superposition of the wavefunctions representing different electron distributions in the same nuclear framework.</em>'-Peter Atkins.</p>
<p>For-instance, to describe the wavefunction of <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{HCl}$</span>, quantum superposition is applied viz.  <span class=""math-container"">$$\psi_{\ce{HCl}}= \psi_{\ce{H^+ Cl^-}}C_1 + \psi_{\ce{H-Cl}}C_2$$</span> where <span class=""math-container"">$C_1$</span> is the <em>probability-amplitude</em> to find the electron-pair at <span class=""math-container"">$|\psi_{\ce{H^+ Cl^-}}\rangle$</span> provided it was prepared in <span class=""math-container"">$|\psi_{\ce{HCl}}\rangle$</span> that is, <span class=""math-container"">$C_1 =\langle \psi_{\ce{H^+ Cl^-}}|\psi_{\ce{HCl}}\rangle;$</span> also <span class=""math-container"">$C_2 = \langle \psi_{\ce{H-Cl}}|\psi_{\ce{HCl}}\rangle$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$C_1^2 + C_2^2= 1.$</span></p>
<p>As written by Peter Atkins in his book <em>Elements of Physical Chemistry</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A better description of the wavefunction for the molecule is a <em>superposition of the covalent &amp; ionic descriptions</em>, &amp; we write (with a slightly simplified notation) <span class=""math-container"">$$\psi= \psi_{\ce{H_Cl}} + \lambda\psi_{\ce{H^+ Cl^-}}$$</span> with <span class=""math-container"">$\lambda$</span> some numerical coefficient. In general, we write <span class=""math-container"">$$\psi = \psi_\text{covalent} + \lambda \psi_\text{ionic}$$</span> [...]According to the general rules of quantum mechanics, in which probabilities are related to squares of wavefunctions, we interpret the square of <span class=""math-container"">$\lambda$</span>  as <em>the relative proportion of the ionic contribution</em>. If <span class=""math-container"">$\lambda^2$</span> is very small, the covalent description is dominant. If <span class=""math-container"">$\lambda^2$</span> is very large, the ionic description is dominant.</p>
<p>[...] The interpretation of the wavefunction, which is called <strong>resonance hybrid</strong>, is that if we were to inspect the molecule, then <strong>the probability that it would be found with an ionic structure is proportional to <span class=""math-container"">$\lambda^2$</span></strong>. For instance, we might find that <span class=""math-container"">$\lambda = 0.1,$</span> so the best description of the bond in the molecule in terms of a wavefunction is a resonance structure described by the wavefunction <span class=""math-container"">$\psi= \psi_\text{covalent} + 0.1\psi_\text{ionic}.$</span> This wavefunction implies that <strong>the probabilities of finding the molecule in its covalent &amp; ionic forms are in the ratio <span class=""math-container"">$100:1.$</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what is known as wavefunction-collapse in Copenhagen interpretation which means <span class=""math-container"">$\psi$</span> <em>collapses</em> to one of its base state after the measurement; here the wavefunction is more prone to <em>collapse</em> to the <em>covalent description</em>. Hence, in this case, the state of the molecule has mostly covalent properties.</p>
<hr />
<p>I've pretty much conceived the upper part; but speaking at the present context of the title of the question, let me start from Peter Atkins' description of benzene in his book <em>Elements of Physical Chemistry</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the most famous examples of resonance is in the VB description of benzene, where the wavefunction is written as a superposition of the wavefunctions of the two covalent Kekulé structures: <span class=""math-container"">$$\psi = \psi_{\text{Kek}1} + \psi_{\text{Kek}2}$$</span> The two contributing structures have identical energies, so they contribute equally to the superposition. The effect of resonance in this case is to distribute the double-bond character around the ring and to make the lengths and strengths of all the carbon-carbon bonds identical. The wavefunction is improved <em>by allowing resonance because it allows for a more better description of the location of the electrons, and in particular the description can adjust into a state of lower energy</em>. ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statement that baffled me comes from Atkins in the last paragraph of resonance as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Resonance is not a flickering between the contributing states: it is a blending of their characteristics, much as a mule is a blend of a horse and a donkey.</strong> It is only a mathematical device for achieving a closer approximation to the true wavefunction of the molecule than that represented by any single contributing structure alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cause of my bafflement is due to the following excerpt of Feynman's lecture <a href=""http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_10.html#Ch10-S4"" rel=""noreferrer"">The benzene molecule</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a mystery about this benzene molecule. We can calculate what energy should be required to form this chemical compound, because the chemists have measured the energies of various compounds which involve pieces of the ring—for instance, they know the energy of a double bond by studying ethylene, and so on. We can, therefore, calculate the total energy we should expect for the benzene molecule. The actual energy of the benzene ring, however, is much lower than we get by such a calculation; it is more tightly bound than we would expect from what is called an “unsaturated double bond system.” Usually a double bond system which is not in such a ring is easily attacked chemically because it has a relatively high energy—the double bonds can be easily broken by the addition of other hydrogens. But in benzene the ring is quite permanent and hard to break up. In other words, benzene has a much lower energy than you would calculate from the bond picture.</p>
<p>Now we want to resolve these mysteries—and perhaps you have already guessed how: by noticing, of course, that the “ground state” of the benzene ring is really a two-state system. We could imagine that the bonds in benzene could be in either of the two arrangements.[...] You say, “But they are really the same; they should have the same energy.” Indeed, they should. And for that reason they must be analyzed as a two-state system shown in Fig.</p>

<p>Each state represents a different configuration of the whole set of electrons, and <strong>there is some amplitude <span class=""math-container"">$A$</span> that the whole bunch can switch from one arrangement to the other—there is a chance that the electrons can flip from one dance to the other.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the blocked-letters Feynman told that if at one time the molecule be found in <span class=""math-container"">$|1\rangle$</span>, at some time later, it may be found at <span class=""math-container"">$|2\rangle$</span> (&amp; vice-versa) as the Hamiltonian elements <span class=""math-container"">$H_{12},H_{21}$</span> are not zero but <span class=""math-container"">$-A$</span>, the <strong>probability of transition</strong> per unit time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we have seen, this <strong>chance of flipping</strong> makes a mixed state whose energy is lower than you would calculate by looking separately at either of the two pictures in Fig. Instead, there are two stationary states—one with an energy above and one with an energy below the expected value. So actually, the true normal state (lowest energy) of benzene is neither of the possibilities shown in Fig., but it has the amplitude <span class=""math-container"">$1/\sqrt2$</span> to be in each of the states shown. It is the only state that is involved in the chemistry of benzene at normal temperatures.</p>

What is the relationship between the constant of equilibrium (Kc) and the position of equilibrium?,"<p>I understand that the <strong>constant of equilibrium</strong> is a ratio of the concentration of the products to the reactants and that this value allows one to estimate whether the position of equilibrium lies to the right (in which there will be more product at equilibrium) or lies to the left (where there will be more reactant at equilibrium). I'm also aware that Kc is affected only by a change in temperature and not a change in concentration, pressure etc.</p>

<p>I know the <strong>position of equilibrium</strong> is affected by changes in concentration, pressure and temperature (unlike Kc which is only affected by change in temperature). I understand Le Chatelier's Principle and how the position of equilibrium shifts in order to minimise the change, and that this maintains the equilibrium constant.</p>

<p><strong><em>My problem arises when trying to relate the two.</em></strong> The position of equilibrium shifts so that the equilibrium constant will be maintained however I don't understand <strong>how this works or why!</strong>
When we say that the position of equilibriums shifts (to the right for example), <em>what does this actually mean?</em> I know that the amount of product will increase but <em>what is actually happening.</em> Is the rate of the forwards reaction increasing? In other words, <strong>what actually is the position of equilibrium? If Kc is the ratio of product concentration to reactant concentration then what actually is the position of equilibrium?</strong> </p>

Can a reaction of the form A + B → AB ever be endothermic?,"<p>I understand that forming a bond between $\ce{A}$ and $\ce{B}$ is an exothermic process, with negative enthalpy, but won't there be energy required to get $\ce{A}$ and $\ce{B}$ close enough together for the bond to form?  So we would get an energy hill with activation energy on one side and heat of formation on the other side.  </p>

<p>Is it ever possible in a chemical reaction to have more energy required to get the reactants $\ce{A}$ and $\ce{B}$ close enough together than the energy released in forming the bond?  In terms of atoms I am thinking that the repulsion between two atoms may reach a peak at some distance greater than the bond length, so we might get an energy hill diagram where: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>What about a situation like breaking and forming bonds on elemental crystals like graphite and diamond?  If graphite pieces $\ce{(A)}$ are sloughed off of a large piece of graphite $\ce{(B)}$ this obviously requires energy to break the bonds, but the graphite flakes don't spontaneously re-bond to the large piece upon light contact.<br>
Likewise, a fractured diamond does not re-bond on contact. Also, in formation of a diamond, why is there a need for a continual input of heat?  <em>If</em> the energy of formation is greater than the energy needed to activate the reaction, then wouldn't the released heat of formation cause other diamond bonds to form without more input of energy.  This indicates to me that some energy is required to begin the process of combining $\ce{A + B}$ to form $\ce{AB}$, even if the actual bond formation is exothermic - that there is a two sided energy hill in reactions of $\ce{A + B -&gt; AB}$, though the activation portion may be smaller than the formation portion.  </p></li>
<li><p>What about an analogous $\ce{A + B -&gt; AB}$ nuclear fusion reaction with heavy species above iron?  Clearly in this case there is a large input of energy needed to fuse elements above iron, and a small release as the nucleons reach a distance that allows the strong nuclear force to dominate.  In this case the energy hill has a greater required activation energy than an energy of formation.  How is this fundamentally different from chemical bonds?<br>
I understand that a critical component is that nuclear attraction becomes stronger than electrostatic repulsion at a critical distance, but might there be some instances of chemical reactions where $\ce{A}$ and $\ce{B}$ have to pass through a less stable conformation to get to the more stable bonded state?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So there are three possible answers:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>$\ce{A + B -&gt; AB}$ reactions can be described energetically solely by the heat of formation of the bonds between $\ce{AB}$.</p></li>
<li><p>$\ce{A + B -&gt; AB}$ can be energetically described by an energy hill, but the heat of formation will always exceed the activation energy, or the energy required to move $\ce{A}$ and $\ce{B}$ through any intermediate states that are less stable than $\ce{A + B}$ (far apart).</p></li>
<li><p>$\ce{A + B -&gt; AB}$ can sometimes be exothermic where the energy required to move $\ce{A}$ and $\ce{B}$ into an arrangement that will allow bonding can exceed the heat of formation of the bond between them.  </p></li>

However, I have seen the aforementioned statement before - that bond formation is ""strictly"" exothermic. </p>

<p>I suspect that the answer is ""it depends"" and that ""it depends"" at least on how accurately bonds are characterized. For example, the first reaction below is endothermic, while the second one is exothermic:</p>

<p>Also, the above example reminds me of certain unstable homonuclear species. Such as $\ce{Ne_2}$, which according to MO theory has a bond order of 0 - i.e. there is no bond.

Effect of Electronegativity on Bond Angles in NH3 and NF3,"<p>I am reading a book: <em>Concise Inorganic Chemistry</em> by <strong>J.D.Lee</strong> (Fifth Edition)<br>

  <p>$\ce{NF3}$ and $\ce{NH3}$ both have structures based on a tetrahedron with one corner occupied by a lone pair. The high electronegativity of $\ce{F}$ pulls the bonding electrons further away from $\ce{N}$ than in $\ce{NH3}.$ <em>Thus repulsion between bond pairs is less in $\ce{NF3}$ than in $\ce{NH3}$.

<li>$\ce{NF3}$: Here F is more electronegative than N, so the lone pair cloud over N is scattered into the $\ce{N-F}$ bonds.

<p>What are the differences and similarities between ionic bonds and covalent bonds and ionic bonds and dipole-dipole interactions?</p>

<p>It seems to be that an ionic bond is nothing but a stronger dipole-dipole interaction. The only difference is where the electrons are.</p>

<p>For example, let's take a sodium cation and chloride anion bond. The sodium had its electron taken away from it. It is now positive. Chloride had an electron added to it and it's feeling negative. Now the two will attract because of these charges.</p>

<p>Now let's take two water molecules. The hydrogen of one will be positive because it is less electronegative and thus the electron density will be greater around the oxygen, which is more electronegative, making it negative. Now the hydrogen of one and the oxygen of another will attract due to the charges.</p>

<p>It seems like the only difference is that if you split the sodium chloride and the water's hydrogens and oxygen, the sodium and chloride will still have a charge, but the hydrogens and oxygen will not.</p>

<p>By textbook, a dipole-dipole interaction is an intermolecular force while a covalent bond, as well as an ionic bond, is a chemical bond. It seems to me that, yes, the forming of ions is a chemical reaction, but the ionic bond is an intermolecular force.</p>

Order of a complex reaction,"<p>Is the order of a complex reaction determined by the slowest step always? Is it so that order of a reaction is determined by rate determining step and since in a complex mechanism, we write elementary steps hence the order should be the molecularity of the rds?</p>

  <li>bimolecular reaction</li>

</blockquote>

<p>The answer as per my book is 1. unimolecular.<br>
But the nucleophilic substitution S<sub>N</sub>1 is unimolecular but it involves two different reactants. Let us take an example,
$$\ce{(CH3)3C-Cl + Br- -&gt; (CH3)3C-Br + Cl-}$$ This follows S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism. Yet, it involves two different reactants even though the R.D.S depends only on the formation of carbocation and the rate law expression being
$$\text{rate} = k[\ce{(CH3)3C-Cl}]$$ where $k$ is the rate constant.
So, is the answer that unimolecular reactions can never involve two different reactants wrong? Or am I missing something trivial?<br>
Also it would be great if other options are discussed. </p>

Reason for formation of bubbles at boiling point,"<p>As I understand it, boiling takes place when the saturated vapour pressure equals to the atmospheric pressure. </p>

<p>But, why does the vapour pressure need to be equal to the atmospheric pressure for water bubbles to form? </p>

<p>According to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffBusZO-TO0/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this video</a>, the atmospheric pressure is cancelled by the vapour pressure at boiling, which allows for the bubbles to form (due to the zero total pressure). </p>

<p>But, I think the atmospheric pressure is the same. So, if we consider the atmospheric pressure to be 1atm at a time, the surface of the water feels 1atm pressure every time (I mean that atmospheric pressure is 1atm as same as the before, but the vapour pressure and the air pressure is acting as a partial pressure according to Dalton's partial pressure concept, it doesn't affect the total atmospheric pressure.)</p>

<p>So what is the real reason?</p>

Why are organic ortho acids unstable?,"<p>Ortho acids like orthoformic acid (methanetriol, $\ce{HC(OH)3}$), orthocarbonic acid ($\ce{C(OH)4}$), and orthoacetic acid (ethane-1,1,1-triol, $\ce{H3C\bond{-}C(OH)3}$) are known to be unstable and decompose spontaneously.</p>

How is energy not stored in bonds?,"<p>Consider the paraphrase from Ebbing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It takes energy to break bonds &amp; energy is released when bonds are formed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's look at the first statement  <em>It takes energy to break bonds</em>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Is this true of spontaneous processes? </li>
<li>If yes, is this true only in a closed-environment sense, where the energy required for a reaction to occur between two molecules is the energy contained within those molecules; <em>i.e.</em> no outside energy is necessary? </li>
<li>If yes to 2), is this energy, outside the kinetic energy of the molecules themselves, potential energy (PE) stored in the bonds?</li>
</ol>

<p>Then for the second statement, <em>energy is released when bonds are formed.</em>
When the PE of the reactants is greater than the PE of the products, heat is released and we have an exothermic process. Consider the conversion of ethane to ethene. This is an endothermic reaction requiring approximately 220 kJ/mol of energy (bonds broken (2X C-H) - bonds formed (C=C). </p>

<ol start=""4"">
<li>As the PE of ethene is greater than that of ethane, why is this not reflected when considering the sum of bond energies in each molecule? For example, for ethane we have 2,812 kJ/mol and for ethene we have 2,246 kJ/mol. </li>
<li>Given the bond energy of C=C (602 kJ/mol) is higher than C-C (346 kJ/mol), why would it be incorrect to assume the energy necessary to drive the reaction is stored in the C=C bond, given the PE of ethene is greater than that of ethane?</li>
</ol>

<p>Lastly, when teaching cellular respiration, we speak of energy being <em>stored</em> in the phosphate bonds when ADP is converted to ATP and in photosynthesis, of the energy from sunlight being stored in the bonds of glucose. </p>

",122461,14-10-2019 19:48,How is chemical energy stored in carbon,"<p>I'm fairly new to chemistry, and I have a hard time understanding how chemical energy is stored in carbon (I'm aware that the question can be generalised to 'how is chemical energy stored', but I'm trying to understand it in the example of carbon). In the example in my book, carbon and oxygen react to form carbon dioxide, releasing energy in the form of warmth in the process.</p>

<p>My book says that the energy released in this process mainly comes from carbon, which is originally the solar energy stored by plants. I have to tried to look for explanations <em>how</em> that energy is stored (not how the process of photosynthesis works, but in what form or what is the meaning of the 'stored energy'), but I still can't really wrap my head around it. The best answer so far was <a href=""https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/3947/what-is-the-nature-of-chemical-energy"">What is the nature of chemical energy?</a></p>

<p>If I understand the answer there correctly, the bond potential energy of a carbon dioxide molecule is lower than the combined bond potential energy of a carbon atom and an oxygen molecule. Given that, there are still two things I don't understand:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why is the bond potential energy in the carbon atom and/or oxygen molecule higher than that of a dioxide molecule? How can that explained? Is this directly related to the chemical traits of the elements carbon and oxygen and the compound carbon dioxide?</li>
<li>Why, or better said how is said bond potential energy converted to warmth in the process?</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm aware that there might be concepts in physics here I don't know or understand to understand a possible answer, and I would be thankful for any pointers to what subjects I should be first reading to understand such an answer.</p>

<p>Edit: I would like to quote here something I came across on wikipedia. I'm not providing it as an answer nor claiming it is correct, just trying to illustrate how <em>confusing</em> it is to find a satisfying answer for this matter. This comes from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond#Overview_of_main_types_of_chemical_bonds"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond#Overview_of_main_types_of_chemical_bonds</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the simplest view of a covalent bond, one or more electrons (often a pair of electrons) are drawn into the space between the two atomic nuclei. Energy is released by bond formation. This is not as a reduction in potential energy <em>(sic)</em>, because the attraction of the two electrons to the two protons is offset by the electron-electron and proton-proton repulsions. Instead, the release of energy (and hence stability of the bond) arises from the <strong>reduction in kinetic energy</strong> due to the electrons being in a more spatially distributed (i.e. longer de Broglie wavelength) orbital compared with each electron being confined closer to its respective nucleus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Italic and bold added by me. Note that wikipedia itself has a '[clarification needed]' tagging in the middle of that text, right after 'two protons', which I removed.</p>

<p>So if I understand <em>that</em> correctly and assuming that info is correct, any formation of a covalent bond would result in energy being released. But that still doesn't explain why my book is claiming the energy is particularly stored in carbon (and not in oxygen), and why it is released as warmth. In addition, the explanation on wikipedia would contradict what I referred to earlier, namely that the energy released comes from differences in bond potential energy.</p>

Can we equate nucleophilicity and Lewis basicity?,"<p>Please note that it is specifically Lewis basicity, not any other definition of basicity. </p>

<p>Consider the interesting trend in nucleophilicity and basicity of the fluoride and iodide anions. The reason claimed for the weak nucleophilicity of the fluoride ion in polar protic solvents is due to the hydration effects which it experiences as it interacts with solvent molecules. This hydration effect effectively prevents it from reacting with electrophiles. In a sense, the hydration effect severely decreases the availability of the electron pair for donation.</p>

<p>Now, although it is claimed to be a weak nucleophile in aqueous solution, the fluoride ion still behaves as a strong Lewis base. This is logical because the interacting species are different in the two different situations. In the case of nucleophilicty, we are considering its nucleophilicity of the species towards another electrophile (e.g. a haloalkane) placed in solution. </p>

<p>In the case of basicity, we are considering it, in terms of its hydrolysis reactions with the water molecules in the hydration shell, producing the hydroxide ions. Thus, the solution becomes an alkaline one and we say that it is basic. </p>

<p>Now, if we use the same perspective to view nucleophilicity, we can thus say that the water molecule is the electrophile and that the fluoride ion is indeed a strong nucleophile because it has managed to attack the electron-deficient hydrogen atoms on the water molecule. </p>

<p>Consider this: What if I remove all the hydroxide ions produce from the hydrolysis of water from an aqueous solution of fluoride ions and add in an acidic species? Would we still observe a reaction between the fluoride ions and the acid species?</p>

<p>My point is that when we consider Lewis basicity and nucleophilicity of reacting species we are not making a fair comparison and thus, we say that fluoride ions are strong bases but weak nucleophiles in polar protic solvents. This may be true based on the Arrhenius definition of acids and bases. But if we were to look purely at Lewis basicity, it would be certainly be inaccurate. </p>

<p>From the perspective of interactions with water molecules, the fluoride ions are definitely good Lewis bases and also good nucleophiles. From the perspective of interactions with other reacting electrophiles placed into solution, the fluoride ions would be both weak Lewis bases and weak nucleophiles, neglecting the hydroxide ions (because even though the acidic species may react with the hydroxide ions, it is not reacting with the fluoride ions, thus we would see those reactions of the acids with the hydroxide ions as a side reaction). </p>

<p>Therefore, is it appropriate to equate these two terms because they both refer to the electron-donating ability of a chemical species?</p>

<p>If I have overlooked something (i.e. some other differences between the two terms), please inform me via the comments. </p>

why do solids and pure liquids have no effect on yield and equilibrium?,"<p>There are three parts to my question.  </p>

<p><strong>Part one:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Let's assume we have a reversible reaction at equilibrium  as follows : Calcium carbonate (solid) goes into calcium oxide(solid) and carbon dioxide(gas).</li>
<li>Let's assume that I add more calcium carbonate i.e I add more solid. </li>
<li>Now I understand that there would be no shift in the position of the equilibrium since we added a solid therefore we induced a very negligible change in concentration ,  but what I am confused about is doesn't more reactant mean more product and doesn't more product symbolise a shift to the right?  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Part two:</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>I have read that the equilibrium constant $Kc$ and $Kp$ are really just close approximations of the true thermodynamic constant which uses activities hence the activity of a solid and pure liquid is always 1 .</li>
<li>However upon further research I discovered that for an esterification reaction the equilibrium constant is 4 
-First of all, the above reaction involves all pure liquids and hence the thermodynamic equilibrium constant would be one ,however why stick to a value of 4 why not easily say it is one since all activities are 1.  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Part three:</strong>   </p>

<ul>
<li>If we do take pure liquids in the $Kc$ value how do you measure the concentration of such a species, wouldn't the value be very high.My intution tells me that pure liquids are only taken when a reaction only involves pure liquids only , but they are not taken in heterogeneous reactions or when the liquid involved acts as a solvent as well.However in a case of a heterogeneous reaction only involving solids and liquids what will your equilibrium constant look like .  </li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly I have no knowledge of thermodynamics and I am still a high school student . </p>
",76307,15-06-2017 17:45,Why are solids and liquids not included in the equilibrium constant? What about in a reaction rate calculation?,"<p>Take for instance the reaction</p>

<p>For liquids, I can understand why you don't include it when you have something like water which (usually) does not play a part in the reaction, but why do you still not include when the liquid takes part in the reaction?</p>

<p>Also, do you include solids/liquids for reaction rates? Increasing the amount of a solid should increase the surface area and thus make for a faster reaction, so it seems like you should, but I am not too sure.</p>

Law of Mass action VS Rate law,"<p>The Law of mass action has 2 parts - the equilibrium rate part &amp; the reaction rate part.
The ""reaction rate part"" states that rate of a reaction is directly proportional to the product of active masses of the reactants with each reactant term raised to it's stoichiometric coefficient. The rate law states that rate of a reaction is directly proportional to the product of active masses of the reactants with each  reactant term raised to some power which may or may not be equal to stoichiometric coefficient of the reactant.</p>

<p>Why are the two laws different when in fact we are talking about the powers to which active masses of reactants should be raised in both the cases ? And which law is correct? </p>
",76398,17-06-2017 17:23,Relation between chemical kinetics and chemical equilibrium,"<p>In my chemistry book, the law of chemical equilibrium is derived from the law of mass action:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a reversible chemical reaction <span class=""math-container"">$$\ce{aA +bB\rightleftharpoons cC + dD}$$</span> where <span class=""math-container"">$a$</span>, <span class=""math-container"">$b$</span>, <span class=""math-container"">$c$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$d$</span> are stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced equation, we have, from the law of mass action, the rate of the forward reaction <span class=""math-container"">$$r_\mathrm{f} = k_1 \ce{[A]^a[B]^b}\label{1}\tag{1}$$</span> where <span class=""math-container"">$[\ce{A}]$</span> represents the concentration of <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{A}$</span> and so on. The rate of the backward reaction is <span class=""math-container"">$$r_\mathrm{b} = k_2\ce{[C]^c[D]^d} \label{2}\tag{2}$$</span></p>
<p>At equilibrium, <span class=""math-container"">$r_\mathrm{f} = r_\mathrm{b}$</span>, so, we have <span class=""math-container"">$$\frac{k_1}{k_2} = \frac{\ce{[C]^c[D]^d}}{\ce{[A]^a[B]^b}}$$</span> Replacing <span class=""math-container"">$\displaystyle \frac{k_1}{k_2}$</span> by <span class=""math-container"">$K_\mathrm{c}$</span>, we have</p>
<p><span class=""math-container"">$$K_\mathrm{c} = \ce{\frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b}}\tag{3}\label{3}$$</span>
which is the law of chemical equlibrium. <span class=""math-container"">$K_\mathrm{c}$</span> is supposed to be constant, for any concentration of the reactants, at a particular temperature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, in chemical kinetics, they tell us that the rate equation, derived from the law of mass action is not always correct. That is, the exponents of the concentration terms in the rate equations may not be equal to their stoichiometric coefficients. If this is true then, the above two rate equations (<span class=""math-container"">$\eqref{1}$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$\eqref{2}$</span>) may not be correct for a particular reversible reaction.</p>
<p>Then, how can we apply the law of chemical equilibrium on every reaction, without experimentally verifying the rate equations? If the rate equations derived from the law of mass action are wrong, then the value of <span class=""math-container"">$K_\mathrm{c}$</span> obtained by the final equation will not be constant.</p>

Why methanol is more acidic than water,"<p>All alcohols are less acidic than water except methanol. Methyl group exhibits positive inductive effect. So water should be more acidic than water. But according to experimental evidence it is not so. Can someone explain the reason for this.</p>
",76399,17-06-2017 17:26,Is methanol more acidic than water?,"<p>Methanol is slightly more acidic than water. Their $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a}$ values, in water, are $15.5$ and $15.7$, respectively. All other aliphatic alcohols, however, are less acidic than water. </p>

<p>Is the following reasoning correct? This is my best rationalization; is there anything better or anything that can be added? </p>

<p>In both hydroxide and methoxide, we have an $\ce{O}$ bearing negative charge. In the former, we have a hydrogen attached to the $\ce{O}$. In the latter, we have a carbon attached to the $\ce{O}$. Carbon is more electronegative than hydrogen, therefore, carbon should be able to better withdraw electron density via induction from the $\ce{O}$. This is a stabilizing interaction.</p>

<p>We often think of methyl groups as inductively donating, but that's molecular profiling. They can inductively donate to a carbocation, partly because a carbocation is highly electronegative, so the carbocation pulls the electrons toward itself pretty well (so there's both pushing and pulling of electrons going on). When you have a methyl group attached to an $\ce{O}$, however, the methyl group is often inductively withdrawing. NMR data supports this.</p>

<p>Now the question is why aren't other aliphatic alcohols more acidic than water? In longer-chain aliphatic alkoxides, you don't just have a methyl group attached to the $\ce{O}$ bearing the negative charge - you have a bunch of methyl groups strung together. These lessen the amount of inductive withdrawal that the alpha carbon can do. Each$\ce{-CH2 -}$ unit attached to the alpha $\ce{-CH2 -}$ is somewhat inductive donating to the alpha $\ce{-CH2 -}$.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In broad strokes, as I understand it, the sodium hydroxide in this case would completely consume the acetic acid, leaving a solution of acetate ions, $\ce{Na+}$ and $\ce{OH-}$. </p>

<p>What makes sense to me then is to figure that the $\mathrm{pH}$ is now dominated by the concentration of hydroxide ions, so the $\mathrm{pH}$ would be given by</p>

<p>$\mathrm{pH} = 14-(-\log([\ce{OH-}])= 11.96$ </p>

<p>i.e., the remaining moles of hydroxide ($0.0005$) per liter of total volume ($55\:\mathrm{ml}$)</p>

<p>but is this correct? Do I need to take into account the conjugate base’s contribution to deprotonation of water? If so, how is that done? </p>

<p>I’d like to be clever and use the lack of $K_\mathrm{a}$ or related constants in the problem to indicate that I’m on the right track, but that would be giving too much credit to my professor’s design of these questions (and the prior question in this series does give $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a}$ for acetic acid)</p>

Does freezing water do work?,"<p>My brother and I were talking about how he needed to take his beers out of the freezer because they would burst open. This made me think of something no professor ever addressed... Obviously work is occurring on the beer can, but oxymoronically it's due to the removal of heat energy. The secret I imagine is in the phase change itself, which likely takes its own energy (which would normally be given off as heat) and uses it to expand (do work). </p>

<p>My questions extend on this idea...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What if we replace the beer can with a 5 inch thick steel capsule. Does the capsule prevent the water from freezing because there isn't enough room to expand?</p></li>
<li><p>What about if you take even more energy away? Would absolute zero finally break the capsule? </p></li>
<li><p>Can a strong enough container simply prevent water from phase changing to a solid altogether, regardless of temperature?</p></li>
<li><p>Normally increasing the pressure of a substance will cause it to freeze (in chemistry class my teacher made water boil at room temperature with a vacuum pump removing pressure). With water though, it expands while freezing... So paradoxically if you have water in a strong capsule and keep increasing the pressure (instead of temperature), will the water eventually freeze or simply remain very cold liquid? </p></li>

The internet defines this point as when the number of moles of the acid equals the number of moles of the base. But if we have for example 1 mole of NaOH and 1 mole of H2SO4 (both in dilute solutions) mixed together, the resulting solution will still be acidic because 1 mole of H2SO4 releases 2 moles of H+ right ? So we will have an extra mole of H+ which will make the resulting mixture acidic.

<p>The way I see hydrogen bonding is that it occurs due to intermolecular charge interaction. The more electronegative nitrogen/oxygen due to the inductive effect the respective hydrogen will be more electropositive. </p>

<p>Since the compound cointaining the more electronegative atom (oxygen/nitrogen) has greater respective charges.Then the hydrogen bonding will be greater between the molecules of that compound i.e either the hydrogen bonding between  phenol-phenol and aniline-aniline should be greater than phenol-aniline. </p>

<p>According to me <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{O-H...O}$</span> should have the maximum strength while <span class=""math-container"">$\ce{N-H...N}$</span> should have the weakest hydrogen bonds based on the fact that oxygen is more electronegative than nitrogen.

<p>I can't reason out the order given in my textbook. After observing it, all I can guess is that oxygen being highly electronegative leads to higher <span class=""math-container"">$\delta^+$</span> charge on hydrogen while nitrogen being less electronegative easily shares its electron cloud with hydrogen, making the hydrogen bond stronger.</p>

Having gone through the factors affecting bond length in two different books, my approach to the problem was:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>$\ce{CO}$ has bond order 3 while carbonate and $\ce{CO2}$ have bond order 4 so
$\ce{CO}$ should have longest bond length.</p>

<p>$\ce{CO2}$ is sp hybridized while $\ce{CO3^2-}$ is sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized.

bond length than $\ce{CO2}$</p></li>

  $$\ce{CO2  &lt;  CO3^2- &lt; CO}$$</p>

Why do atoms get smaller moving left to right on a periodic table?,"<p>I get that it's because of the increase number of protons, but I still don't understand the concept. When you move left to right on a periodic table, the protons increase <em>at the same rate</em> as the electrons. In fact,  the number of electrons end up being the same as the number of protons, no matter how far you are across a period (unless it's an ion).  </p>

<p>So shouldn't the attractive force of the nucleus and the forces of electron-electron repulsion be cancelling out due to the equal number of protons and electrons in an atom? Or is it because protons have a greater force of attraction compared to the repulsion force between electrons?</p>

How does the number of electrons increase in beta decay?,"<p>So, I am having trouble understanding beta decay. Particularly the number of electrons.</p>

<p>For example; Carbon-14 decaying into Nitrogen-14.</p>

<p>Carbon-14 has 12 neutrons, 6 protons and 6 electrons.
When it decays 1 neutron is converted into: 1 proton, 1 electron and 1 anti-neutrino.</p>

<p>So after the neutron breaks down, and before emission, there should now be:
11 neutrons, 7 protons, 7 electrons and 1 anti-neutrino.</p>

<p>But now 1 electron is emitted from the atom (as a beta ray), alongside the anti-neutrino. Which means the numbers should now be:
11 neutrons, 7 protons and...6 electrons.</p>

<p>Since 1 electron is created in the process and 1 is emitted out of the atom, then surely the number of electrons shouldn't change from the original 6 of carbon-14.
But Nitrogen-14 has 7 electrons?? Can someone explain?</p>

"Is the energy of the orbital an electron ""resides"" in, considered to be a factor of that electrons ionization energy?","<p>The answers to <a href=""https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-factors-that-affect-ionization-energy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a Quora question</a> mainly refer to the factors as generally being, the electrostatic forces of attraction between the electron and the positively charged nucleus and all other events, by which this force is affected, i.e. atomic size (distance of the electron from the nucleus), the penetration effect, the shielding effect (by inner electrons) and the spin-pair repulsion phenomenon.</p>

<p>My textbooks also mention that electrons in the same <strong>shell</strong> have a ""reasonably constant"" distance from the nucleus, leading to the <strong>key</strong> factor of the observed progressive pattern down a period being due to the increase in atomic charge.</p>

<p>I get all that, but what I fail to understand is <em>why none of these sources</em> mention the energy of the electron's resident orbitals. It's my understanding that when an electron is ""plucked"" from the atom by means of the ionization energy value, or put into orbit by that value, they do so from their orbitals/subshells. </p>

<p>Now, each of these subshells have a different integer value of energy which increases up the count. I also concur that these orbitals have differing forces of attraction acting on them from the nucleus due to distance, inner electrons and the electrons proximity to the nucleus leading to different values of Ionization energy for the electrons ""in"" them, but I find it difficult to grasp that <strong>all</strong> electrons in the same <strong>shell</strong> have similar ""distances"". In one shell, for instance $n = 3$, there are <strong>3 subshells</strong> each of which have a different three dimensional geometry and hence distance from the nucleus. The electrons in these subshells also have different amounts of energy which is what I'm asking about. </p>

<p>Don't these different energy values play a part in their ionization energy? i.e. can't the lower ionization energy of electrons in further subshells be explained by the higher potential energy of that subshell, as the higher the energy the lower the value of ionization energy?</p>

Hydrogen bonds - why not in HCl?,"<p>In a textbook<sup>1</sup>, I found the following clear definition of hydrogen bonds:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The strongest secondary bonding type, the hydrogen bond, is a special case of polar molecule bonding. It occurs between molecules in which hydrogen is covalently bonded to fluorine (as in $\ce{HF}$), oxygen (as in $\ce{H_2O}$), and nitrogen (as in $\ce{NH_3}$). For each $\ce{H-F}$, $\ce{H-O}$, or $\ce{H-N}$ bond, the single hydrogen electron is shared with the other atom. Thus, the hydrogen end of the bond is essentially a positively charged bare proton that is unscreened by any electrons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not an ""etc."" definition. It is made clear that we only call it a hydrogen bond when we have either of the three bonds: $\ce{H-F}$, $\ce{H-O}$ or $\ce{H-N}$.</p>

<p>My question is why this definition excludes compounds such as $\ce{HCl}$? $\ce{HCl}$ and $\ce{HF}$ are very similar with one covalent bond that pulls the hydrogen electron towards their ""shared"" region, exposing the hydrogen atom as a positive end of this permanent dipole. Both can create secondary dipole bonds to adjacent molecules of the same type.</p>

What force attracts electrons from another atom to a non-closed valence shell?,"<p>As I understand the balance in an atom is reached when the number of protons is equal the number of electrons. And the force responsible for this is based on each proton attracting one electron.</p>

<p>But why non-full valence shell attracts electrons from other atoms? Looks like it exerts a force independent from proton-electron bondage force. Does the shell itself have some force?</p>

<p>For example, <code>Na</code> and <code>Cl</code> form an ionic bond resulting in <code>NaCl</code>. But why a balanced atom of <code>Cl</code> (17 protons VS 17 electrons) attracts an excessive 18th electron from <code>Na</code>? If it's not the proton of <code>Cl</code> attracts it then what? Looks like the valence shell has its own force.</p>

<p>For $\ce{[Ni(CO)_4]}$, here $V = 10$, $M = 4$ and $I = 0$, so $H = 7$ hence $\rm sp^3d^3$.</p>

\text{Component} &amp;\% &amp;\rho,\,\pu{g cm-3}\\ \hline
\text{Nitrogen}  &amp;78 &amp;0.001251          \\
\text{Oxygen}    &amp;21 &amp;0.00142897        \\
\text{Argon}     &amp;1  &amp;0.001784 
\end{array}</p>

<p>I'm calculating the density of $\pu{1 cm3}$ of air. Individual masses in $\pu{1 cm3}$ of air:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
&amp;\text{Oxygen}   &amp;\pu{0.0003000837 g}\\
&amp;\text{Nitrogen} &amp;\pu{0.00097578 g}  \\
&amp;\text{Argon}    &amp;\pu{0.000001784 g} \\
\end{align}</p>

<p>The final density is equal to $\pu{0.0012937037 g cm-3}$</p>

<p>Then I realized that the density of ozone should be lighter due to the ozone layer to be able to exist, otherwise, the ozone gas, as it is fairly more dense than air, would pass directly through the atmosphere. The problem is that the density of ozone gas at the same conditions (STP), have a density of $\pu{0.00214 g cm-3}$, which is $65.41654785\%$ heavier than air. </p>

<p>With the context explained, my question is: if is really a ozone layer up there in the atmosphere, how it is there, being heavier than the base gas mix that is below it?</p>

Reasons for solid or liquid soap,"<p>Soap is made by a saponification reaction, where a fat reacts with hydroxide ions to form a surfactant and glycerol.</p>

<p>To make a solid soap $\ce{NaOH}$ is used, while $\ce{KOH}$ is used for liquid soaps.</p>

<p>I don't understand why the alkali metal has such a great impact on the state of matter. Usually the argumentation is based on intramolecular interactions, such as Van-der-Waals forces or hydrogen bonds, but if the same fat is used once with $\ce{NaOH}$ and once with $\ce{KOH}$ the resulting surfactants are basically the same, so the interactions shouldn't differ too much.</p>

<p>The only reason I could think of is the size of the alkali metal. Potassium has an atomic radius of 231 pm which is quite a bit more than the radius of sodium, being 186 pm. But why the atomic radius should have an impact on the state of matter of the soap is still unclear to me. Maybe I'm also completely wrong with this assumption.</p>

<p>A while ago, this question <a href=""https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/9209/hard-soap-vs-soft-soap-why-do-they-work-this-way"">was already asked here</a> on this forum, but I wonder if the given explanation is the only reason for the different state of matter. It's absolutely true, that the reactivity of the alkali metals increases from top to bottom, but can this solely explain the phenomenon? <a href=""https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/3704/rch"">@rch</a> provides the solubility of $\ce{NaOH}$ and $\ce{KOH}$ to back up his answer, but I don't think that this is sufficient. You cannot simply change the hydroxide ion by a fatty acid and assume, that there are no substantial amendments in the reaction behavior, can you?</p>

<p>Does anyone can explain this in more detail?</p>
",82008,31-08-2017 20:29,'Hard' soap vs. 'Soft' soap: Why do they work this way?,"<p>In school, we did an experiment using fat and $\ce{KOH}$ to create 'soft' soap.</p>

<p>Afterwards, we added $\ce{NaOH}$ to change it into 'hard' soap.</p>

<p>I read on multiple places on the internet that the difference between using Potassium and Sodium is what determines if it becomes a 'hard' soap or 'soft' soap.</p>

<p>Am I correct in the notion that the $\ce{K+}$, resp. $\ce{Na+}$ ions connect to the $\ce{O-}$ ends of the Fatty Acid?</p>

<p>Is it possible to skip the first step and create 'hard' soap by using $\ce{NaOH}$ right away?</p>

<p>Why does 'Soft' soap dissolve so much easier than 'Hard' soap? Or in other words: Why is it much easier for the $\ce{K+}$ to fall off than for the $\ce{Na+}$ ?</p>

"What is the difference between ""spontaneous"" and ""energetically favourable""?","<p>I read somewhere that the difference between energetically favorable reactions and spontaneous reactions is that <strong>energetically favorable</strong> reactions are ones where energy is released, i.e., $\Delta H&lt;0$, whereas <strong>spontaneous reactions</strong> are ones where the change in Gibbs free energy is negative, i.e., $\Delta G&lt;0$. Thus it is possible for a reaction to be energetically favorable but not spontaneous if $\Delta H$ is negative, and yet $\Delta G$ is positive because $\Delta S$ is negative and the product of it and T is large enough to compensate for $\Delta H$ as per this equation: $\Delta G = \Delta H - T(\Delta S)$. </p>

Scratching the inside of a flask to crystallize aspirin - what is it called and has it been scaled up?,"<p>I've just watched the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amTAuK25P6c"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Periodic Table of Videos on Aspirin</a> and saw some ""tricks"" used to induce crystallization after the synthesis. Rapid heating with a heat gun followed by rapid cooling in ice was not sufficient, but scratching the bottom of the flask with a stirrer seems to have triggered rapid crystallization.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> For those who are sensitive to the sound of chalk or fingernails on blackboards, better lower the volume during the actual scratching starting after <code>07:10</code>, it's quite loud!</p>

<p>There is a little bit of an explanation for how the scratching helps:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you scratch it you are actually forming a nice surface for the crystals to aggregate on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but I am not sure I really understand what is really happening. </p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is the scratching just glass-on-glass? Is this crystallization happening on the (probably) invisibly small scratches only, or does it happen throughout the solution? Is there an ""official"" name for this technique? Has it ever been scaled up in some way?</p>

<p>For example, <a href=""https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/a/8786/16035"">this answer</a> says that the scratching produces a rough surface on the bottom of the glass for nucleation, but <a href=""https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/a/44486/16035"">this answer</a> says it is shards of glass in solution that are providing the nucleation sites. I'm trying to understand what is actually happening when chemists rub stirrers on the inside of flasks to induce crystallization, and once that's understood, to find out if the phenomenon is scaled up in manufacturing situations.</p>

Validity of van der Waals equation,"<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NCfy9.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Van der Waals  had stated that at high pressure, pressure exerted by ideal gas on the walls of container is more than real gas.</p>

<p>However in this graph, one can clearly see that, the at high pressure volume of real gas tends to be more than volume of ideal gas. Hence real gas should be exerting more pressure on the walls of the container, as it occupies more volume. So why does this not hold true? </p>
",82796,18-09-2017 05:33,Does the van der Waals equation remain valid when repulsive intermolecular forces dominate?,"<p>The van der Waals equation for a real gas is:</p>

<p>$$RT =\left(p+\frac{a}{V_\mathrm{m}^2}\right)(V_\mathrm{m}-b)$$</p>

<p>We have understood this formula by saying that $a$ is the term which is for force of attraction between the gas molecules and thus the pressure of a real gas will be less than that of an ideal gas.</p>

<p>Therefore some factor must be added to the pressure of a real gas to make it equal to ideal gas pressure so that it can be used in $p_\mathrm{ideal}V_{\mathrm{ideal}}= nRT$.</p>

<p>Also, if we see the compressibility factor graph , suppose for $\ce{N2}$:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hm1Da.gif"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hm1Da.gif"" alt=""Graph of Z vs P for N2""></a></p>

<p><sup>(Source: <a href=""http://image.tutorvista.com/content/matter-states/compressibility-factor--function-p.gif"" rel=""noreferrer"">TutorVista</a>)</sup></p>

<p>If $Z &lt; 1$, then attractive forces are dominating. We see that after a particular temperature, the value of $Z$ becomes greater than $1$, implying that the repulsion forces are dominating in $\ce{N2}$.</p>

<p>Now, since repulsive force dominates, the pressure of the real gas will increase and be greater than that in ideal case.</p>

<p>To find the $p_{\mathrm{ideal}}$ now, we will need to deduct some value from the $p$ of real gas, which means $a$ should be negative. However, this is not so as $a$ can never be negative.</p>

<p>No value can ever be deducted from $p$ in the van der Waals equation.</p>

<p>Then how does the van der Waals equation still work and give the correct data?</p>

",82799,18-09-2017 06:37,Sulfur trioxide - vacant d-orbitals,"<p>Sulfur trioxide violates the octet rule. Upon drawing the Lewis dot structure for sulfur trioxide, we see that the central sulfur atom is bonded to three other oxygen atoms by double covalent bonds. Therefore, sulfur is in fact surrouded by 12 electrons and not 8 as per the octet rule. This is explained by the fact that the excited state of sulfur has the following electronic configuration: $1s^22s^22p^63s^13p^34s^03d^2$. As there are 3 oxygen atoms, $sp^2$ hybridised orbitals take part in single $\sigma$ covalent bonds with the unpaired $p_y$ orbitals of the oxygen atoms. In sulfur, there still exist one unpaired $p$ orbital and 2 unpaired $d$ orbitals. These remaining unpaired orbitals take part in $\pi$ covalent bonds with the unpaired $p_z$ orbitals of the oxygen atoms. My question is, why do the electrons in sulfur from the $3s$ and $3p$ orbitals in the ground state promote themselves to the $d$ orbitals rather than one electron going into the intermediate $4s$ orbital and the next electron going into the first $3d$ orbital? After all, according to the Aufbau Principle, $4s$ is less energetic when compared to $3d$.  </p>
