“Reserved” seats at crowded food court? (Japan),"<p>I am at a crowded food court, food stalls all have a 20 minutes queue, and not a single seat is available. Eating outside of the food court is not an easy option either.</p>

<p>But then there is this 4 people table with nothing but a small bag put at the middle of it.</p>

<p>I can only suppose that a person or group of persons has put it to ""reserve"" the table before going to the food stalls. I don't know how long ago they put it.</p>

<p>I am just one person, so I could eat on the corner of the table without touching the bag, and possibly be finished before they even come back. I could also simply wait for a seat to become free, which should take no more than 10 minutes.</p>

How can I emphasise to my housemate that I'm really not interested in discussing my diet with him anymore?,"<p>Because we're in such close proximity and we share a kitchen, he'll see that I do things a little differently to him. (one example would be that I drink almond milk instead of cow's milk). </p>

<p>Which it seems is a trigger for questions, which then moves onto debate, within these debates, he seems to want to emphasise how ""I'm being brainwashed"" or how his brother went on a vegan diet and that's all he ever spoke about (which I can understand, <em>some</em> vegetarians/vegans can be very passionate), plus other things out the scope of the question.</p>

<p>But, I have no way indicated any interest in said questions (unprovoked), nor' have I spoke about my diet previously, except with the action of cooking in front of him (I guess?). He's just ""giving me his honest opinion"" apparently. </p>

<p>Anyway, the most recent debate he got quite offensive without realising it and I would like to cut the conversations about my diet off before it begins from now on. I want to do it politely regardless of any offence caused, we're good friends and will continue to be so. </p>

<p>What can I say to him if he brings anything up again?   </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: When writing an answer, I'm really not looking for your opinion on dietary requirements (whether you praise it, or criticise it.) I would very much just like to emphasise to my housemate that I'm not looking to answer questions on it. It just seems this time my diet is the topic of conversation. </p>

<p>Also, I'm normally happy to answer questions about my diet (if someone is curious) as much as someone who goes to the gym often would. But, I now know where these questions lead with this particular individual. </p>
",1911,17-08-2017 03:59,How to ask a vegan to stop telling me about veganism because I am not interested in it?,"<p>I work in an office with a couple of vegan coworkers. If I bring any animal products to lunch (even cheese, which they can smell), I'm likely to get a long earful about it. In the past, I've listened patiently to their arguments for why I should change my eating habits, but frankly I'm tired of doing this - I just want to eat my lunch in peace and get back to work.</p>

<p>To be clear on that last point: I've nothing against veganism or vegans; I'm not trying to mock them or cause friction within the workplace. I've thought about the issue plenty, and considered their arguments, but I've made up my mind to not change my diet.</p>

<p>I've tried to find places to eat that won't be as noticeable for them - but it doesn't matter if I'm at my desk or in the lounge - they'll still find me. One of them makes a point of mentioning the rallies they attend or time spent picketing butcher shops - as a result, I suspect they see these confrontations as less about me and more about a convenient opportunity to further this sort of activism. </p>

<p>I could go to HR over this, but I'd prefer to find a way of resolving the issue quietly.</p>

<p>What is the best way to put an end to their attempts to get me to change my diet, while also not setting myself up for future conflicts with them?</p>

",3893,14-09-2017 14:13,How to get friends/partner to stop texting me pointless pictures/videos,"<p>I have a handful of close friends, including my partner, who frequently text me with a completely random picture or video of something cute and/or funny that they found on the internet. For example, a 2-minute video of a pool full of puppies, or an LOL cat meme. I find this very irritating, but for years, my response has been to either ignore it and pretend I was too busy to reply, or I reply with a one-word answer, e.g., ""haha"", ""lol"", ""cute"". Replying (or deciding whether to reply) is always stressful for me because it feels disingenuous, and I always waste a few moments of my life thinking ""Maybe I should tell them how I really feel, since they can't seem to figure it out from my lack of enthusiasm or the fact that I have never once reciprocated"". But in the end, I usually go with one of my one-word answers because I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings and I don't want them to stop texting me about other things. </p>

<p>I would estimate that this happens on average once per day from each of these friends. Sometimes they skip a day, other times I may get 5 in one day from one friend. Sometimes the pointless intrusion occurs over e-mail or Facebook, but most commonly it is over text. Sometimes the intrusions are more involved than just a picture or short video: it could be a 20-minute video or something I'm supposed to read. I have been present when <em>they</em> get such messages from each other, and it seems like their response is typically a mixture of ""AWWW, so cute!"" and ""Yay my friend saw a random cute/funny thing and thought of me!"". So I understand that they want me to feel that way when they send me these things, and I appreciate the intent.</p>

<p>So my question boils down to this: </p>

<p><strong>How do I get my friends and partner to stop texting me random cute/funny pictures/videos/links in a way that ideally won't hurt their feelings too much or cause them to stop reaching out to me in other ways that I like?</strong> </p>

<p>At this point, I also need to somehow address the fact that I have been acting like it doesn't bother me for years (and maybe they even think I slightly enjoy it based on my slightly positive responses).</p>

How to ask someone to stop playing music without sounding religious?,"<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Music is one of those things which are declared <em>Haram</em> (unlawful) by Islam, yet there are a lot of people here (and in other Islamic countries) who listen to it. So Music isn't considered a taboo here by the public as do other sins like <em>Vulgarity, Drinking, Gambling, etc.</em> but still, people know that it's <em>Haram</em>.</p>

<h2>Common Situations</h2>

<p>I will give you some examples of the situations I get caught up in, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sitting in a gathering and someone plays Music on their mobile phone - it gets even worse when they assume me similar to them and often start with <em>""Do you enjoy this song too?"", ""Have you seen this movie?"", bla bla.</em></li>
<li>Sitting in a public transport and driver playing music on the bus/van/<em>rickshaw</em></li>
<li>Public events and music being played in the background</li>
</ul>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>I want to ask someone to stop playing music (or use head-phones if it's very necessary) without sounding a religious person.</p>

<h2>What I have tried so far</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>When loud music is played around</strong>: I find it easier to stop them as I simply say ""Please attenuate the volume of music, I am studying/doing my work"" - though I am yet to find a way to stop them once music volume is somewhere between inaudible to too noisy.</li>
<li><strong>Events which may have music</strong>: It's an easy one as I simply refuse to attend them.</li>
<li><strong>Public Transport</strong>: If music is being played, then I don't sit in that vehicle; if driver plays music mid-way through the journey, then at times, I ask him to stop but often it leads me to sound stupid as everyone stares at me as if I am alien. Also, I can't lie that I am having headache or reading, etc.</li>

Enforcing to be treated respectfully,"<h1>My issue</h1>

<p>What's the best way to deal with a verbally aggressive/bully colleague?</p>

<h1>Context</h1>

<h2>Objective background</h2>

<p>I have started a new job 2 months and two weeks ago as a software developer. It's my second job, I'm 26. </p>

<p>Ten days ago, a newcomer came in as a future lead developer, he is at least 32.</p>

<p>We are 4 on our team :</p>

<ul>
<li>Bob: the oldest developer on the project (here since 9 months), doesn't have good knowledge of what we do.</li>
<li>Me: I have far less experience on it</li>
<li>Joe: an old QA, came 1 months ago</li>
<li>Gregory: The newcomer</li>
</ul>

<p>And my manager (Alice).</p>

<h2>Subjective background</h2>

<p>I'm a quite discreet person, I don't make much noise, I don't interact with others more than necessary, I work on my own to find a solution and only ask for help as a last resort. I'm attached to my space (having a clean/empty desk and a need for flow mode/hyperfocus state). I'm more efficiency/technically oriented.
Despite of that, I work ""a lot"" (meaning solving 1-2 bugs per day) with Bob and Joe. It also happen to me to make jokes with members of other teams (that's my way to fulfil the social contract), but usually I don't make eye contact and show a poker face.</p>

<p>The newcomer is more people-oriented, trying to speak to everyone, making a lot of noise, talking to everyone, taking a lot of space. He is also not very good technically and prone to ask before trying to find a solution.</p>

<p>To sum it up: I'm an introvert (INTJ-T) and he is an extrovert.</p>

<p>To be really honest, I don't like this type of men, even when he doesn't talk to me. I feel no offense but I am a little envious of it, sometimes.</p>

<h2>Actions</h2>

<h3>Phase 1: help</h3>

<p>Despite that, in the beginning, I have spent a large amount of time explaining where the things are (multiple times), how they work (for those I have a good understanding of), setting up the tools we have, debugging some configuration issues.
In the mean team suggested to my manager that she should propose a bunch of training courses to the team to fulfil the technical gap.</p>

<h3>Phase 2: taking distance</h3>

<p>In the last few days, I have tried to take some distance from the questions he was constantly asking (because it was tiring and it just dropped my productivity).</p>

<p>I have started by saying things like: ""I don't know"", ""Go to see Bob about it"", ""I don't feel legitimate to answer you on that"", ""I have no time for you now"", ""That part is assigned to you"".
According to the context, it's all true and I have said it in a neutral tone.</p>

<p>His answers: ""Say it anyway"", ""I don't care"", ""You have to explain me"", ""I'm the newcomer, you have to explain me"", ""How will I do it if no one explains it to me"", etc.</p>

<h3>Phase 3: the clash</h3>

<p>He asked me something yesterday, something very obvious to me, something I think he'll be able to deduce with much less information than he has. I answered mechanically ""obviously not"" (it was a yes-no question), in a neutral tone.</p>

<p>He began to be very aggressive and saying: ""There is nothing obvious, you have no choice than to help me, etc."".</p>

<p>I answered: ""It's not my job to undergo that you calm your nerves on me, I deserve to be treated correctly"" with a tensed voice.</p>

<p>Acting while being overwhelmed and letting these feelings leak against your interlocutor isn't an acceptable behavior (in France). It's mostly viewed as a childish behavior/lack of maturity.</p>

<h3>Phase 5: manager/Alice talk</h3>

<p>I raised the issue during my weekly meeting (just Alice and me), and her reaction was to tell me that we will get to know each other better and I should have been more careful about him.</p>

<p>I just told her that I'm not here to fulfil his needs and I've quit my job few days later for many reasons including the lack of support from her (my hierarchy).</p>

<h3>Phase 6: Gregory talk</h3>

<p>As I have expected, I had a talk with Gregory few days after the clash.
There are a lot of people like that who like to have a frontal confrontation, thinking that it solves everything. I do not share this view (I know that this situation would eventually happen with him).</p>

<p>He told me that he feels useless and that he frustrated, plus the fact that I was not providing him the help and not even watching him I was saying so.</p>

Why is he doing that: I think I had an accurate view of his feeling and of what would happen

",5781,23-10-2017 09:37,How to redirect a real-life help vampire to an alternate source of food... um... assistance?,"<p>I've recently had some troubles with a <a href=""http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/"" rel=""noreferrer"">help-vampire</a> in the office. She's about my age (late twenties), from India and she doesn't speak Dutch. She works in the same office as me, but not on the same project/team. She was hired on a recommendation by somebody on my team and is currently learning to program in Java. The only coding she does are exercises related to this, she is not working on any project. </p>

<p>She often traps me at the coffee machine, water cooler, during lunch/Friday afternoon drinks or even when I'm on my way to/returning from the toilet. <strong>She always starts with small-talk,</strong> but after two or three sentences she starts asking questions that google can answer. Often, these questions are not coherent or specific enough to answer, even when a language barrier is taken into account. Apparently, she still thinks I must be happy to help her (after all the unwillingness I've shown). It's like she's hoping that by asking enough questions, I eventually will slip in my resolve and do her work for her: provide her with answers to her tutorials/exercises. </p>

<p>Since I've never been very good at teaching, and I certainly don't have the patience to teach her (she's in my opinion very slow on the uptake), I've tried garlic and crosses, and everything suggested in <a href=""http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this article</a>: </p>

<ul>
<li>I've bookmarked StackOverflow and the official Java documentation for her. </li>
<li>I've sent her multiple 'let me google that for you' links, told her to google things herself before asking, even told her I'm not talking until she used the resources I gave her. </li>
<li>I've always been careful to never do her work for her, and just give her the answer. I've always told her to go find it herself. In short, I've never been really helpful to her (which makes the fact that she keeps coming back even more baffling).</li>
<li>I've told her that the answers to her questions are all over the internet, and pointed out to her that cornering me to ask these questions doesn't give me a good impression of her. </li>
<li>I've pointed out all of her help-vampire characteristics as described in the second paragraph. </li>
</ul>

<p>So now, I'm at a loss as to what to do with her. Hopefully, somebody here has dealt with a help-vampire before. How do you get them to feed somewhere else? And if there is no alternative food-source, how do you get them to prefer starving over feeding off of you? </p>

Blocking a suicidal friend?,"<p><strong>The illness</strong></p>

<p>There is this Israeli girl (let's call her Amy) who I know for a few years now (I'm living in Germany). Her mental state got worse over the last years: Amy has depressions, an eating disorder, no self confidence and maybe a narcissistic disorder (that's what a therapist said). Additionally, she has a problem with authorities, no real friends left (only online ones like me), her mom is probably narcissistic, too (that's what I think), and they have a very difficult relationship.</p>

<p><strong>Resignation, breaking off contact and talking again</strong></p>

<p>When the problem got worse, I tried to urge her to go to therapy for months. Eventually I resigned (like her mom) and broke off contact. Half a year later, she wrote me, being highly suicidal. Of course I talked her out if it. I started to talk with her again and she got a bit better. I urged her again to go to the therapist, but after she dropped out of school, she had to go to the army and had no opportunity to go to therapy anymore. </p>

<p><strong>The current situation</strong></p>

<p>Two weeks ago she told me that she tried to kill herself, but failed. She wanted to hang herself but the construction broke. I know her well enough to believe it (she dropped hints already). A few days afterwards she was allowed to leave the army permanently due to her condition. Although I am the only one she talks to about her mental health, she has trust issues (I left her once). When I urged her to go to therapy again, she asked me if I will leave her again in case she went to therapy. I told her that I will certainly, if she won't go. Unfortunately, I was not very understanding, but I got my point across telling her that she needs to go to become healthy again and that I won't accept her not going to therapy. That was ten days ago and we didn't speak since. </p>

<p><strong>The question</strong></p>

<p>Amy was pulling me down (and is still a bit). I didn't pay attention to it since she was and is still suicidal. I planned to help her as much as I can, but since she does still not accept any help, it's time for me to let go. I thought about trying to force her into a closed facility, but she wouldn't let them help her either.<br>
<strong>She might write me if she wants to kill herself and I will not be able to ignore her. Should I block her on all channels?</strong></p>

"What should I do with a short, unintentional eye contact?","<p>Sometimes while walking past people, or because you thought you heard them say something (but they didn't), you look at people for a second. Sometimes your eye wanders when you're lost in thought. And some of those times they happen to look at you too, at the same moment. </p>

<p>There's an inadvertent, short eye contact. I usually instinctively look away, but that somehow feels weird. As though I'm deliberately avoiding eye contact, or like I was just caught staring.

How to Handle Openly Hostile Strangers On the Subway?,"<p>Three times on my commute around town on the subway, I've encountered people who are openly hostile for whatever reason, potentially drugs or alcohol or maybe just naturally violent. In two cases the person in question went around the train shouting death threats at people, pounding on the doors and windows of the train, and in one case spitting on people. The other was an altercation on the platform that again ended in someone being spit upon and an arrest by transit police.</p>

<p>The general reaction from people (myself included) on the train was to keep your head down, not engage, and wait for either this passenger to disembark or for transit workers to deal with the situation while praying you aren't targeted individually. Are there any other more constructive ways to deal with this situation?</p>

Now, of course there's a chance he's gotten great at chess in that year and he whoops me, and honestly, I'd love that. It'd be cool seeing him improve so much, and I like playing people better than me. There's a much bigger chance, though, that I choose how close our game is again. </p>

<p>This brings me to the title question: should I let him win? If we play multiple games, should I win all of them? </p>

<p>On the one hand, I'd <strong><em>HATE</em></strong> if someone let me win on purpose. On the other hand, he's 14. I'm 24 and started playing 16 years ago. Of course I'd probably win. It seems kinda mean to beat him every single time we play. </p>

<p>(NOTE: If I chose to win, I'd keep it close again. I'd miss some obvious moves that would end the game; if I made a move that put him at risk, I'd ask him to stop and think about what I might be planning; if he made a blunder (like he missed his queen was threatened), I'd probably point it out and ask if he was sure. If there's a better way to win ""nicely"", please feel free to let me know).</p>

<p>Disclaimer: This is based on the experience of a friend - I will call him Bob. However, I was present and it got me thinking.</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>A social event with many activities for people of all ages. Chess was among them, staffed with good, amateur club players like Bob (no Bobby, though). A family strolled by and asked if their son could play. For sure, Bob was willing. Please note, that he neither knew the child, nor the family.</p>
<p>The child was between 5 and 7 years old. Also, the child was interested in chess, but not a <em>wunderkind</em> (beginner level, not yet fully acquainted with the rules of the game), so it became a rather one-sided affair. The parents were not present, and came back later.</p>
<h2>Question</h2>
<p><strong>How do you best approach such a game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> The game shall be a good experience for the child.</p>
<p>This especially from the perspective of someone, who is not good at interacting with smaller children (a bit reminiscent of bit reminiscent of that <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/1456/how-to-act-when-people-bring-a-baby-to-work"">question</a>). And when the game in question hardly involves luck. The question is not restricted to chess, you may also think of Go or something else, hence the generic question.</p>
<p><strong>Bob's approach:</strong><br>
It was just one game. After repeating some of the important rules, Bob tried to neither let the child win, nor did to give his best. When the child seemed to get bored, he wrapped up the game.</p>

How do I explain to my coworkers I'm not 'facebooking'?,"<p>I work as a designer, so I often do research and also have to test stuff. I often have my phone in my hand or on in front of me as I use a mirroring program to show my designs directly onto my phone while I'm working on them. This helps me a lot with making designs. When a supervisor tells me 'I like Amazon's checkout, we should do something similar', I need to browse amazon, take notes and screenshots etc. </p>

<p>None of my supervisors have issue with this, but my colleagues always make comments. 'Are you done Facebooking, I have a question' when I am holding my phone. Or 'I doubt Amazon is allowed in the office.'. If they need something from me they will say 'You don't have a lot to do right?'. It even goes so far that if I say I've had a stressful day, they will just reply with 'Filled with online shopping?'. </p>

<p>I'm getting a bit sick of it and I feel like I'm losing respect of people. I have explained many times it is work related, but they are not having it. How can I explain it to them without sounding like I'm making fake excuses?</p>
",9090,12-01-2018 15:18,How can I use a cell phone at work for work purposes without appearing to be slacking off?,"<p>Where I work, it is frequently mentioned by both co-workers and managers that many people find it rude when staff use cell phones while on duty because it is seen as attending to personal items while on company time. I frequently find myself in situations where I must take notes, file online reports, and consult online records while ""in the field"" or while in another facility (where I do not have easy access to a desktop or laptop computer). I usually use a smartphone for this purpose but am concerned about how this is seen. Under these circumstances (frequent travel away from a ""home base""), carrying a tablet or laptop computer is impractical but not altogether impossible.</p>

<p>How can this be resolved? Would it be better to explain to others around me that I need a few minutes with my phone to check the status of the BQR Pipeline and submit a High-Priority Form 10-E or would it be better to carry and use a tablet or laptop anyway in order to be perceived as someone who is really ""working"" rather than texting friends and playing games? It is sometimes possible to delay online work until I am alone but sometimes it is not, either because the online work is high priority or because management has imposed a deadline to complete it.</p>

<p>If it is relevant, this is in the USA. I am specifically interested in the interpersonal aspects of this situation as it relates to workplace social skills rather than any specific issue of workplace policy.</p>

<p>The obvious options I see are:</p>

<p>1) Just use the cell phone and don't attempt to explain anything unless I am specifically confronted by co-workers or management (e.g. ""So, how many Pokemon did you catch today while you were on the clock?""). The obvious downside to this is that I could be damaging workplace social relationships even while getting all of my work done.</p>

<p>2) Explain to others why I need to use a cell phone.</p>

<p>3) Get a tablet or laptop and carry it around under the understanding that the benefits of being seen as working hard outweigh the burden of carrying it.</p>

<p>4) Push back on management and attempt to get policies or procedures changed so that I can take notes by hand and access online systems on a less frequent basis (e.g. at the end of the day).</p>

How can I convey to a friend that the way she chews is incredibly loud and uncomfortable?,"<p>I have a friend who I'm very close with and this has been something that truly, truly bothers me since I've met her. I've known her for about 4 years now and I have never gathered the courage to tell her that the way she chews is loud and obnoxious. </p>

<p>Once she was having an altercation with a coworker and complained to me about it. The coworker told her that she smacks her teeth when she chews and it's so loud. My friend said ""I don't think I do that"" and since she was so upset about the situation I said ""maybe record yourself and see?""</p>

<p>I know, that's a lame answer. </p>

<p>Then one time she was chewing incredibly loud and I said ""hey you're kind of chewing with your mouth open"" and she proceeded to not do that for the next couple minutes but then soon resumed. </p>

<p>Then another time we were with another friend who also said she could ""hear her chewing right in my ear"" but didn't say it to her. </p>

<p>I know she's not doing this on purpose which is why I would feel terrible bringing it up. She's so self conscious as it is, I don't know how I can break it to her, especially after 4 years of not saying anything. </p>
",9377,19-01-2018 22:56,How to tell someone that they are eating with their mouth open?,"<p>I'm from France and I've been educated with ""eating manners"" I consider ""normal"" (chew with your mouth closed, don't put your elbows on the table, wait until everyone is served before starting to eat...).</p>

<p>I'm OK with people that don't share theses ""rules"" though.</p>

<p>Thing is, my girlfriend's mother (their parents come 3/4 times per month) has the habit of eating with her mouth wide open. It's noisy, not very elegant (in my opinion) and that makes me slightly uncomfortable, but I'm okay dealing with it. She is very nice and generous otherwise, and I don't want her to be offended -- which she can easily be.</p>

<p>However, <strong>I'm afraid that this behavior might cause her trouble in other circumstances, and I think she might be unaware of her way of eating with mouth open</strong>: she told us a story about how she was eating a croissant in a café with a colleague, and she dipped her croissant in her coffee. The colleague responded to her in a rude way, saying stuff like ""<em>it's truly a shame to eat that way, I can't believe it, if I were you I'd be covered in shame...</em>"".</p>

<p>She keeps telling that story like a joke because the colleague would be the one who's wrong because dipping your croissant in the coffee is not <em>that</em> shameful, and in my opinion pretty common where we live. However, I'm seriously thinking that said colleague was rude because of the way she chews...</p>

<p>Now I'm worried that this issue might cause her more trouble: in her job, she will be more and more solicited to business meals or cocktails with people I'd qualify ""classy"".</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>How can I tell someone that, in my opinion, eating with your mouth open might offend people you are eating with, and that I'm worried that this could disservice them?</p>

<p>Since this is like a ""stepmother-stepson"" relationship, we're not as close as family or friends, but still close, so I really don't want to be rude.</p>

<hr>

<p>I already talked about this with my girlfriend, she's <em>indeed</em> at a better place to tell her. However, she is more reluctant than me to take the risk of being somehow offensive, and cares less about possible ways that this could, again, disservice her.</p>

<p>I'm an Indian guy who's recently immigrated to Britain for college. I'm also very, how to put this, interested in cross-dressing. In India, this wasn't possible for me since I lived with my parents, but a few months ago I decided to take the plunge and buy some Western woman's clothes. These clothes are not for wearing in public. That time and every time since then, no matter what store I go to, I've been asked (by the cashier or clerk most times, or sometimes by other shoppers) some variation of ""Who are you buying this for?"". Usually, I just pretend to have not heard the question and continue what I was doing, but I'm always extremely visibly embarrassed after such incidents, and in one case, the man who had asked the question kept pressing the issue. Additionally, I often want to try out items in the dressing room (I do try to do this as discreetly as possible), which makes ignoring such questions more embarrassing.</p>

How can I save my friend from tilting?,"<p>Frequently my friend will invite me to play a game that we both enjoy. It has a fairly venomous reputation for having a toxic community, and while there are exceptions I'm forced to agree with the reputation.</p>

<p>Still, for the most part I think I am able to stay positive and we both have fun.</p>

<p>However, when my friend plays the more stressful roles in the game, where he is more in the spotlight for his performance, he quickly descends into being extremely irritable, even though usually he is a beacon of positivity. It becomes obvious almost immediately that he is not having fun playing the game when he gets like this, and he has to very obviously restrain himself from snapping out in anger at his friends, who we all know he cares about.</p>

<p>I want to continue enjoying this game with my friend, but more importantly I want to help him to continue having fun, even when he plays the roles that he finds stressful, or performs poorly.</p>

<p>I have tried ignoring his situation, but he just stays on the same path. I have also tried to make jokes to lighten the mood, and mention positive things, to focus on the silver-lining, but this ranged from making things worse to keeping things the same.</p>

<p>I am not particularly concerned about the effect this has on me, or my other friends. Rather, answers to this question should try to help me help my friend deal with his anger going forward. He is a very reasonable individual and I expect that he would be amenable to many suggestions.</p>

",11241,01-03-2018 19:09,How should I deal with my friend's anger issues?,"<h1>The Situation</h1>
<p>Almost every day I'm spending time with my group of friends, among them one I will call John. Together, we often play videogames. When playing, John gets very easily upset by things others would brush off, and he gets very vocal about it.</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Due to bad ping, John gets hit by a shot when he was already around a corner. While others would let out a sigh or a disappointed &quot;Oh crap&quot;, John begins to yell &quot;<strong>What the?!</strong> I was already around the corner! This f***ing game is so broken! I was already safe, I shouldn't have died!&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further, he almost always portrays any perceived injustice as specifically against him. It's not just bad net-code or wonky hitboxes - he acts as if the game <em>specifically</em> and <em>exclusively</em> treats him bad and nobody else.</p>
<p>As one might imagine, over the course of several hours, these outbursts begin to dampen the fun quite a lot, and sometimes lead him to &quot;rage-quitting&quot; and leaving the group for the day (which in turn might force us to abandon a game we all enjoyed because we are too few people).</p>
<h1>What I tried so far</h1>
<ol>
<li>I attempted to reason with him at first. For instance, I explained him that wonky hitboxes cause him to miss an enemy just as often as it causes the enemy to miss him. John was very resistant to such explanations and in turn claimed that others never miss <em>him</em> and that he is the only one affected negatively by it. Of course, this is just one example, but you get the idea.</li>
<li>I attempted to just ignore him and hope he would calm down by himself. This usually doesn't work, as he just keeps on going and on about how he is the victim of everything, about how everyone else is supposedly cheating and so on and so forth. It is just so draining to hear him ranting and complaining all the time and it just drains the fun out of everything for me.</li>
<li>I attempted to speak to him about how his outbursts and rants affect me, but he argued he can't help himself when he feels treaten unfairly. The rest of the conversation then ends up as shown in <strong>1.</strong>.</li>
<li>I attempted to calm him down by saying things like &quot;It's just a game, calm down&quot;, with varying degrees of intensity, ranging from a relaxed and friendly tone to something more akin to &quot;Shut the f*** up! You've been ranting non-stop for one and a half hours now!&quot; (which was not very calming in retrospective). As one might imagine, the results ranged from &quot;No improvement&quot; to &quot;And then things got so much worse&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<h1>What I considered trying</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>I considered directly telling him that his temper is a massive problem for me (and at least &quot;very annoying&quot; according to others in our group) and that he has to get a grip on himself if he wants to keep playing with us.</p>
<p>I don't think that this is a good idea, because he might believe I don't want him in our group - which is not true. I do want to play together with him, just without all the temper tantrums. Further, I'm afraid John might think I am not allowing him to be upset at all. I don't mind him benuig upset once or twice, or saying &quot;Oh f***!&quot;. But to me, there is a difference between being upset once for 2 seconds and a 90-minute rant about how the world treats you and only you unfairly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I considered asking him to play really hard and frustrating games with low down-time, such as &quot;Hotline Miami&quot; or &quot;Super Meat Boy&quot;. The idea behind this is that when failing over and over and over, he would have to learn how to deal with his frustration and hopefully be more relaxed when playing with us - similar to how people say the best way to cure a fear of flying by flying a lot.<br />
I don't know if this idea has any merit. He might just quit the games when getting too frustrated instead of building higher tolerance against frustration, or they might not have any effect at all on him.</p>

However, it's supposed to be top secret as it's a touchy subject, and my mom herself forbade me to share it with anyone, after discussing with her friends that they would all keep quiet about it.

What can I do when classmates don’t stop recording me after I ask them to stop?,"<p>I’m 18 years old in grade 11 in a high school in Bucharest.</p>

<p>Some of my classmates wanted to make photos and videos of me and I hate that. I tried to tell them “enough!!” but they don’t listen. </p>

<p><strong>Q-1:</strong> How can I make my classmates to stop recording me, or ask my permission before they do this? </p>

<p>I wish I could know how to do this, because this thing is bugging me a lot being recorded without my permission just because they want to bother me. It’s simply not right to happen and not logic. </p>

<p>Today was a good example of this behavior: I have arrived to school and one of my classmates entered, put her stuff on her desk and then she sat on my table taking selfie and I caught her including also me selfies. I made clear signs for her to stop recording but no use, she then made a video of me and took several photos and I kept trying to tell her “stop, enough” but no use. I’m pretty sure she sent to someone my picture or video of me.</p>

<p><strong>Reason:</strong> In grade 7 I had a lot of problems for nothing with my classmates. One of them had a phone and filmed me, and put it on YouTube, and then I got very pissed off, because it’s not right at all. Luckily, my best friend got the video removed completely from YouTube.</p>

Dealing with coworker who is excessively self-deprecating,"<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>My coworker is very self deprecating to the point where several of my colleagues are worried about him. He will make negative remarks on the quality of his work, and even himself, saying things like ""my work sucks"", or ""I'm stupid"". Additionally, he's taken to complimenting me in a way that is simultaneously self deprecating to him (for example, implying that I will one day replace him). </p>

<p>At first I tried to encourage him not to say these kinds of things, but as time went on, and my (short) patience wore off, I'm just annoyed by him. This sort of behavior is annoying to most of my colleagues, but especially me, as I'm a pretty disagreeable and argumentative person, and this kind of behavior is particularly annoying to me (due to things in my past that are too lengthy for me to get into). </p>

<p>I've had several conflicts with him in the past, where I attempt to confront him about this sort of behavior, but I've failed to handle these confrontations in a productive way. </p>

<p>These confrontations basically play out as me asking him to stop making these sort of jokes, and him saying that it is a problem with the way I perceive the jokes, and not the fact that he is making the jokes in the first place. That's the short of it, but the way these confrontations actually play out involve a lot of frustration from both him and me. I'm at least a little rude during these discussions, and he is very defensive, so we get nowhere. </p>

<p>Although I agree that I'm taking these jokes more poorly than most of my coworkers, I don't agree that these jokes are okay to make. They reduce confidence in him, reduce team morale, and make him difficult to work with.</p>

<h1>The question</h1>

<p>What is the best way for me to deal with this coworker? I have a lot of difficulty dealing with people I dislike, at least for long periods of time (such as someone I work with every day). The best I've come up with is keeping my interactions with him as short and professional as I can, but I have difficulty doing that without also making it clear that I want to talk to him as little as I possibly can (i.e., I'm worried that I'm still coming off as rude). Is that the best I can hope for, or is there another solution?</p>

<p>He has, in the past year, really gotten into the project and proven his capabilities more than once; implementing new components in a very self-sufficient-while-team-oriented way, communicating directly with customers, and being overall very commendable. He gets positive feedback from everybody around him, all the time, including the product owner and all relevant stakeholders.</p>
<p>He is very methodical in his approach to everything; he will double-check shell command lines before hitting enter; double-check lines of code before saving/compiling; and he noticably thinks before talking. This is <em>not</em> obnoxiously slow, it is <em>not</em> annoying, it does not come across as being &quot;stupid&quot;, but I suspect he thinks it is/does.</p>
<p>He will do his utmost to find information or solve problems on his own, but will call me when he cannot. Our typical conversations (usually by phone, as we are in separate cities) go like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Them: I am sorry, I have to annoy you again.</p>
<p>Me: No problem, what can I do for you?</p>
<p>... we work on some issue ...</p>
<p>Them <em>(while typing)</em>: Sorry, this will surely annoy you hugely, I am sooo slow.</p>
<p>Me: No problem, it's fine...</p>
<p>Them <em>(while learning something new, which he cannot possibly know)</em>: I am so sorry that you have to waste so much time on me...</p>
<p>Me: No problem, I like sharing know-how...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so on and so forth. At every step, he will complain how slow/annoying he is, and how sorry he is for annoying me, and that he doesn't know things.</p>
<p>Nothing of what he complains about does in fact annoy me. I am very glad that he is here, he has (together with other new colleagues who joined the team at the same time, and whom he has worked together for many years) taken a large part of work away from me that was overwhelming me before. We are all very easy with each other, there is mutual consent about almost everything. I would rather have him call more often than less often.</p>
<p>In the parts of the software which he has inherited from me, he has taken on full responsibility, but he has also gotten complete freedom to do as he like within our coding guidelines; he has constant access to me and other team colleagues for peer reviews, help, information about historic areas of the code and such.</p>
<p>I have, in the past flat out told him that nothing of what he does annoys me, that he is doing great (which he measurably is); I have explicitely voiced that I do not expect him to magically know things about our software or infrastructure that he cannot know, and that I'd rather have him ask me than try to find something in the sparse documentation. It is true that I am typing and coding <em>very</em> fast in comparison with him because I know every nook and cranny of that software environment; but I certainly have not rubbed it in, and concerning the actual results he is not in any way slower than other people. Any typing speed issues are masked by slow Webex/Skype connections anyways. ;)</p>
<p>He has been this way from day 0; it's one of the first things I noticed about him (not only towards me, but also others, including colleagues from his old team).</p>
<h1>Question</h1>
<p>Recently, he has voiced doubts about being in the right spot because he seems to be so slow. It would be a nightmare for me if he quit the team - he does a <em>lot</em> of good work, everybody is happy with him, etc.</p>
<p>Do you have suggestions how I could behave, what I could say or do to make it easier for him? I would love if he would be confident in his role. Obviously, stating objective facts (like &quot;you used X hours for feature Y; I needed the same time for a comparably difficult feature Z - you are as fast as me&quot;) or pointing out the happy customer/colleagues does not do it.</p>

How can I address a man talking inappropriately about women?,"<p>Source is this twitter thread: <a href=""https://twitter.com/MalwareJake/status/976848126987374593"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://twitter.com/MalwareJake/status/976848126987374593</a></p>

<p>Excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She said that the guy who appeared to be the unofficial group leader started talking about one of the (very few) female conference speakers like a piece of meat. The other guys jumped in and described the many (specifics were very shocking) things they would do to her.
  One even made rape ""jokes"" (which are obviously NEVER okay).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When in such company, I would just leave the conversation, after taking in how repulsive this kind of attitude is. But that doesn't make them understand that this is just not ok. So the question is: how to be assertive in these circumstances.</p>

<p>This 'unofficial group leader' seems to express such things to (re)establish his leadership position. At that point, the others in the group are already determined to be no match for him (at least in the leaders' mind).</p>

<p>One way of addressing him, could be: ""Now I see how you are still single"" or ""wow, your girlfriend must be really happy with you"" (depending on the situation). Although that's just passive aggressive, and will not result in a constructive ""hey, this way you are talking reveals that you are actually not respecting women at all, you should revise how you look at women.""</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the real reason this guy is acting this way? (I suppose I have some idea about it, but please elaborate)</li>
<li>Given that we know or assume to understand the reason why he talks this way, how to best address this guy and/or group, to get them to understand what they are doing?</li>
</ul>

<p>Edit: adding context.</p>

<p>This is something that often happens at tech conferences, but of course it happens everywhere (I suppose) when there's too many men and little or no women and drinks. There's this idea that you can't have good looks and be smart at the same time.</p>

<p>I've seen it happen in Belgium (Europe). My biggest concern is not detoxing tech events, but I'd like to see this kind of behaviour disappear entirely. It just shows a total disrespect for women in general, and it's a hard idea to get across, especially towards men with lower moral standards.</p>

<p>Edit: I'm asking from the viewpoint for someone in the group. Maybe the better question is: what can someone in the group (obviously not the alpha guy) do, to make sure the rest of the group isn't tricked into thinking this is the proper way to talk about women?</p>

<p>(If anyone has better tag suggestions, I'm a bit at a loss.)</p>

<p>Edit:
I'm going to refrain from refining the question. I like how people interpreted it in different ways, and there are a lot very good opinions on these interpretations. Changing the question could mess up other people's answers for no good reason.</p>

<p>I don't see it as a duplicate of the linked question as this is a group going wrong thing, which is harder to counter than an individual making an inappropriate comment. But I agree it covers a lot of ground and probably overlaps with several other questions.</p>

<p>Thanks everyone!</p>
",12264,23-03-2018 08:14,How to helpfully react to a male coworker's sexual comment about a woman,"<p>I'm a 29 year old male. Sometimes find myself in a situation with a male coworker who I've just met, or a male stranger who I'm talking with (at a bus stop, for example), and they make a comment about a woman that I find to be in bad taste. </p>

<p>For example: ""Have you met the new secretary? She has an amazing body doesn't she?"" </p>

<p>Or a stranger in public: ""Check out that girl ... I'd like to get some of that!"" </p>

<p>My goal is to simultaneously communicate these two things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I feel that their comment is demeaning and objectifying of women</p></li>
<li><p>I'm not trying to put them down, and I don't think I'm morally 'above' them. I don't think less of them as a person and I haven't become less interested in having discussion/friendship with them.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Clarification:</strong>
I'm not suggesting that it's disrespectful for a man to simply find a woman attractive. What I find demeaning and objectifying is when a man verbalizes his sexual attraction to a woman's body as a topic of casual conversation - especially when the man clearly has no knowledge or interest in any character trait of the woman. Also demeaning and objectifying are comments made about sexual things he would like to do with her.  </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
At least one answer to this question notes that I didn't mention anything about wanting to change the way the person thinks. But that is really my greatest hope in the way that I respond - that I would help the person to think more critically about the way they talk (and think) about women; that their perceptions of women would not be reduced to sexual preferences and fantasies.</p>

What to do when a friend's close relative dies?,"<p>As a 17 years old, I have never had to face this unfortunate and sad situation before. My friend's grandad just died, what can I do to support him?</p>

<hr>

<p>I live in Delhi, India . My friend comes from a Hindu family but is an atheist. His family is not orthodox.</p>
",12280,23-03-2018 15:42,How to follow up with someone who lost a loved one?,"<p>My friend's dad died two days ago. I gave her my condolences that same day. My question is, should I check up on her on a interval basis? Like everyday, every two days, etc.? And what kind of things to say after the first condolences? I mean, I imagine I can't give her my condolences every single time, yet I don't find it appropriate to, for example, make jokes to her...</p>

<p>I don't want to overwhelm her, perhaps she wants to be alone for a while, but I also do not want ""abandon"" her on one of the saddest moments of her life. I understand that this may be different from person to person, and from relationship to relationship. But I would like to know common ways to support friends on this matter. </p>

<p>Perhaps a little bit about my relationship with her will help:</p>

<p>She is not a really close friend, like one of those whom you speak with everyday, we say Hi and chat for a while about once a week, we don't see each other at all, but I really appreciate her, she is a good friend. We just get along well.</p>

<p>If this helps at all, we are both on our mid-twenties.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: with respect to <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/258/how-to-enquire-about-someone-after-they-learned-bad-news"">possible duplicate</a>, I am not sure is quite the same question, because in that question they are talking about an accident that occurred, so, follow-up questions like ""how is your father doing?"" seems fine, but in my question we are talking about death, I can't ask her ""is your father still dead?"" or something like that. Should I give her some space? Should I ask her how she is doing? Should I try to talk about other stuff? Normally, when a friend is sad, I try to talk to them, and sometimes even make them laugh, or at least forget their problems for a while, or sometimes I provide just company and understanding... but this is different, she lost her father, I know I just can't ""try to make her laugh"" on this one... </p>

<p>I know this is not an exact science, but your experiences dealing with similar situations, what you did right or wrong, or if you were in her shoes in the past, how did people follow up with you? Did you feel annoyed, Did you feel ok? Did you want more space? Did you want to talk more? Did you want to be able to talk about other stuffs?</p>

How do I get someone to stop liking/spamming memes?,"<p>Okay, so this little ""lol r4nd0m m3m35t3r XDXDXDXD"" I know keeps spamming me with a bunch of useless, irritating, and non-funny ""memes,"" to which my response is asking her to kindly not do that, and to act like she is a rational human being who isn't constantly trying to grab attention by pretending to be funny. This is a serious question I need answered and I really want to put a stop to this. The ""lol random"" thing she's going through is hopefully a phase and she'll maybe grow out of it, but seeing her act like this out of nowhere after 3-4 years of me knowing her, and her <em>not acting like this</em> really does annoy me. I've asked her to stop sending me these things and to kindly stop talking about it all the time (as I don't like it), but she never listens. Help? (Please note: I know there is another question like this, but none of the answers seemed to fit exactly what I needed)</p>
",12744,03-04-2018 21:28,How to get friends/partner to stop texting me pointless pictures/videos,"<p>I have a handful of close friends, including my partner, who frequently text me with a completely random picture or video of something cute and/or funny that they found on the internet. For example, a 2-minute video of a pool full of puppies, or an LOL cat meme. I find this very irritating, but for years, my response has been to either ignore it and pretend I was too busy to reply, or I reply with a one-word answer, e.g., ""haha"", ""lol"", ""cute"". Replying (or deciding whether to reply) is always stressful for me because it feels disingenuous, and I always waste a few moments of my life thinking ""Maybe I should tell them how I really feel, since they can't seem to figure it out from my lack of enthusiasm or the fact that I have never once reciprocated"". But in the end, I usually go with one of my one-word answers because I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings and I don't want them to stop texting me about other things. </p>

<p>I would estimate that this happens on average once per day from each of these friends. Sometimes they skip a day, other times I may get 5 in one day from one friend. Sometimes the pointless intrusion occurs over e-mail or Facebook, but most commonly it is over text. Sometimes the intrusions are more involved than just a picture or short video: it could be a 20-minute video or something I'm supposed to read. I have been present when <em>they</em> get such messages from each other, and it seems like their response is typically a mixture of ""AWWW, so cute!"" and ""Yay my friend saw a random cute/funny thing and thought of me!"". So I understand that they want me to feel that way when they send me these things, and I appreciate the intent.</p>

<p>So my question boils down to this: </p>

<p><strong>How do I get my friends and partner to stop texting me random cute/funny pictures/videos/links in a way that ideally won't hurt their feelings too much or cause them to stop reaching out to me in other ways that I like?</strong> </p>

<p>At this point, I also need to somehow address the fact that I have been acting like it doesn't bother me for years (and maybe they even think I slightly enjoy it based on my slightly positive responses).</p>

How to convince my girlfriend to be open about the discussion of political topics,"<p>My girlfriend and I have been together for about 5 months. She tends to be more left leaning in her beliefs and I tend to be more centered. </p>

<p>Every now and then she'll ask me something related to something she agrees with politically (often to do with feminism/race etc), and I would end up disagreeing with her. The problem arises however, when I explain why I disagree, and she, instead of understanding we have different beliefs, gets angry that I don't agree with her, going so far as to completely ignore me for a whole day (we don't live together). On the flip side, I do everything in my power to have a civil discussion and to further the conversation. </p>

<p>As an example, here is a conversation we had recently.</p>

<p><strong>Her</strong> : Did you hear that Kanye West thinks that Black Lives Matter is an excuse to whine?</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> : Yeah, I did.</p>

<p><strong>Her</strong> : Outrageous, am I right??</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> : Well, I don't think it's an excuse to whine necessarily, but I don't exactly agree with all of BLM's actions.</p>

<p><strong>Her</strong> : What, so you're a racist now?</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> : I didn't say that. I completely agree to the general sentiment that Black Lives, do in fact matter. What I don't agree with is how BLM has gone about trying to prove this point to the public, with some members assaulting police officers who had done nothing wrong and things of the like. </p>

<p><strong>Her</strong> : You know what, forget it, sorry I ever brought it up.</p>

<p>We've been together for almost a year and through a lot, we love each other dearly, but such things are making us quarrel and that's no good to either one of us.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I've received a very good answer that captures the essence of the question perfectly, though the close votes seem to indicate it is still not understood as well as it could be. What I wanted to know is what behaviour during a discussion of a political topic where both of us have strong opinions on the subject will ensure that the discussion does not deteriorate into an argument, considering above-average sensitivity of the one of us, and the unlikeliness of our opinions changing, perhaps even allowing us to be brought closer together by our slight differences and help us understand the other's point while not necessarily starting a debate.</p>

"How can I tactfully on a conflict-avoidance way, inform memorably a group of feminists some of their arguments affect our community because misandry?","<p><strong>Objective:</strong><br>
Remaining amicably, for them not to feel rejection on a personal way neither on a philosophical level, so they can still gather at our home and discuss feminism and activism, keeping hateful ideas out. I don't want to make them feel I'm dismissing their whole political stand, I've taken feminist postures many times myself because I take the side of justice.</p>

<p>But now I feel used because it seems some of them only listen to me when I'm actively helping their cause under their terms, but if I offer this type of insight they shut me out.</p>

<p>Phrasing confrontational arguments in a polite sounding sentence would not nearly suffice, that's why the <code>conflict-aversion</code> tag is there. I'm expecting a smart strategy that includes a way to measure success.</p>

<p>I care because my community is in fact troubled with double standards affecting both women and men. I've found many hateful speech and attitudes being fed.
I'm not a fan of judging people, only ideas. Some ideas stand in the way for them to be listened to.</p>

<p>I don't believe there are ""misogynists"" and ""misandrists"", but people acting on misogynistic and misandristic <strong>ideas</strong> I have no trouble debating this topic with men shooting themselves on the foot with misandristic comments coming from the ""macho"" spectrum, like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yeah dude, we men are spendable, nature says so, wars prove me right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I don't know how to discuss with a feminist group saying things like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Of course men are allowed to cry, but to be honest it kinda does make them less manly""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""That will be done by robots soon and we won't need men.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is he good for if he can't (insert stereotypical manly skill)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've found it very difficult to bring up the topic. In the past I did approach a couple of groups with this issue. Their answers were similar to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Misandrism? What is that, does that even exist?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""That's an anti-feminist made-up word""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is the same as being dismissed. </p>

<p>I tried to explain what I knew about it and made the observation that it applies to both men and women.</p>

<p>While trying to remain cordial and constructive during these discussions, there are individuals with a tendency to throw popular terms at me like ""mansplaining"".</p>

<p>Answering</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Telling you a word exists because the phenomenon exists is not mansplaining""</p>

<p>didn't help. Defending my views become harder when you realize the word is not even included in most dictionaries (including apple's, windows, chrome's auto-correct tools).</p>

<p>The group I'd be approaching now has direct influence on a person I care about deeply, my girlfriend. They gather at the place I share with her usually after they have larger meetings. But I've also noticed those comments at larger meetings/gatherings (weddings, congresses, etc), not only my distant family but also friend's events and at other events where many women gather and men are minority.</p>

<p>But I can't help to overhear some stuff that not only annoys me but truly hurts, like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh yeah, women don't need men, totally, the human species don't need men now that we have artificial insemination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't want her to ditch any of her friends but she could be more supportive of the value of men to society, or to life in general for that matter.</p>

<p>I also don't want to change her, she's already a smart, sensitive person but a smart, sensitive person can only deal with issues in a smart, sensitive way if they're able to recognize there even <em>is</em> an issue.</p>

<p>I haven't tried anything as of yet because the situation had not presented itself and my girlfriend has never made such type of comments herself. Overhearing was not intended. I don't want her to feel as if I'm blaming her for her friend's opinions, but her silence disappointed me a bit because it made it appear as if she agrees or finds it funny even when I think she doesn't, her silence allowed this person's opinion to seem like the strongest opinion in the room because no one objected.</p>

<p>About the person who made the comment, my girlfriend usually just says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She's a bit extreme.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it seems she just accepts that because she's close friends with the group leader whom is also an older friend of my girlfriend.</p>

<p>I've done some research and that is not being ""extreme"", there's a word for that and it is called 'misandrism', which is not an insult.</p>

<p>I don't want to sound irrational or insensitive while I convey this is a very real concern that hurts me.</p>

<p>I'm relatively new in her life in comparison with a couple of the women of the group and I think she respects my points of view regarding many topics including feminism, but I still worry she'll take my observation as an anti-feminist remark because it has happened elsewhere with other people.</p>

<p>I just want her to be supportive of the value of men when there are no men present in the room.</p>

<p><strong>How can I have a conversation with my girlfriend where I am able to share my concerns with her in a way she will understand why I think this is a problem and encourage her to stick up for men when she's around friends who say dismissive or hateful things about men in general?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> On why some of the answers offered are not nearly close to be accepted.<br>
Some suggest I go for the passive indirect approach of simply being a good example: I myself defend the value of women in front of a bunch of guys no matter how tough or stubborn they are. My girlfriend already consider me a great example.<br>
Some suggest I should be better informed on how women have it worse and more difficult than men: I am very well informed, my girlfriend knows.</p>

<p>I don't want her to start ""not all men""ing. I want her to intervene with her own sensitivity to keep hateful ideas at bay. And I can't be putting words in her mouth, she will say whatever she thinks it is intelligent and sensitive to say.</p>

<p><strong>A valid answer would be similar to</strong> the one that offered a structured way on how to aim at the actual objective. That answer recommends I should set the tone by putting my insecurities on the table first and after covering that in general to strengthen our bond, then is offering some lines I could use to address the specific situation that I find in need of intervention. I've been considering accepting that answer, but it's still falling short and stopping at a warning that I might not be able to have a desired result. The only thing missing in that answer is how to encourage my girlfriend to make a positive change or influence their group, that's in the scenario in which she only needs some courage reinforcement and support from me. (Note that initially I didn't use the ""encourage my girlfriend"" phrase in the question title, that was edited by a moderator and it did help me to understand a little more on how to approach the situation, so thank you for that.)</p>

<p>Each time the subject comes to the table, it leads to an argument as she loves having grandchildren (both my elder sisters are mothers, and she expects me to become a father down the line).</p>

<p>I have tried to explain to her my point of view :</p>

<ul>
<li>I can't stand children, and I don't know how to act towards them.</li>
<li>I wish to focus on my own life, goals, and hobby and don't want to spend time taking care of a child.</li>

<p>Those are my reasons not to have a child and my SO shares that point of view. </p>

Responding to self deprecating jokes I can't relate to,"<p>The other day I was talking to an acquaintance--someone I see often but haven't really talked to enough to consider a friend. While talking, this person would make self deprecating jokes about their weight.</p>

<p>I'm not the skinniest person in the world, but I'm pretty skinny and this person is larger than I am. As such my normal response to self deprecating humor--making similar jokes back and playing along--felt like it would come off as insincere since clearly I'm not in the same situation as them. At the same time, trying to deny that their joke is accurate also would've felt hollow since I'm not very close to them and they <em>are</em> clearly overweight.</p>

<p>I ended up laughing and saying something like ""yea, that sucks."" But it felt empty and awkward.</p>

<p>I appreciate the fact that they're trying to be comfortable with their body image enough to make jokes about it, but <strong>what should I focus on when responding to jokes like this to keep the conversation light and show my support for them?</strong></p>

<p>While in the elevator she out of nowhere says ""<em>It seems like I always get the freight elevator.  I know a I am a big girl, but is someone trying to tell me something</em>""?

How do I handle being seated at an unacceptable table at busy restaurant?,"<p>My friend and I went to a nice restaurant the other night (about $20 per entree). It was busy and we had to wait a good 15 minutes and there were people waiting behind us as well.</p>

<p>The host took us to our table but it turned out to be right next to the bathrooms and I really don't like that so I asked if we could get a different table but was told no because the restaurant was full, and the host was not very nice about it either, which was kind of embarrassing to me.</p>

<p>I thought about asking if we could get back in line and wait for a better table but I couldn't come up with the words to do so, and being turned down for that as well would have made the situation much worse and I'm not sure if they have a procedure for that and the whole procedure would be awkward as well. I didn't want to disrupt our evening so we just sat down and had the meal.</p>

<p>I really didn't enjoy the dining experience as people kept walking right next to our table going in and out and we could hear flushing noises and it was just uncomfortable. I was kind of annoyed to have paid so much (bill came to $70 after everything) for such a poor experience.</p>

<p>At the same time I understand that under the circumstances the restaurant is not to blame. But then why did they put a table there to begin with? I doubt anyone seated at that table enjoys their experience.</p>

<p><b>Edit</b></p>

<p>The question: How do I insist to get a different table or be re-inserted into the wait queue so as to get the next available acceptable table?</p>

<p>I'm thinking that as we arrive at the table instead of sitting and taking the menus from the hosts I might say ""I'm sorry but this table isn't going to work for us, I'd prefer to wait for the next available table after this one.""</p>

<p>Could someone with restaurant hospitality experience say how this would go over, whether a procedure exists for this? I'm imagining being walked back to the front and the next people seeing us and then being upset when they get to the table...</p>

<p>I was at a restaurant yesterday and one person on the table next to us was so loud that they sounded as if sat right at our own table, an annoying companion you could say.</p>

<p>Regularly, loud people are not too bothersome of an issue as to not being able to enjoy a meal, and you can even crack a joke at their expense, but this person was being rude to their own fellows, made me cringe from how she talked to one of them.</p>

<p>Even if that wasn't the case, sometimes the occasion calls for a more intimate or at least a slightly more comfortable and calm atmosphere.</p>

<p>Whenever I'm alone reading or writing or whatever and the restaurant is not that fancy, I move tables by myself taking the main things with me. I've noticed sometimes the waiters are very helpful and immediately start moving the rest of things, other times they sort of look like they're not sure how to handle the situation, I'm guessing it was because they have assigned tables and I moved to some area they're not responsible for? Additionally, having a company increases the complexity of that fórmula.</p>

How to handle being accosted by shop staff when walking past store?,"<p>Occasionally I walk past this cell phone store and sometimes when the store is empty there's an employee (or the owner) standing outside accosting passers by. </p>

<p>He'll make eye contact with people from several meters away as they approach and say ""hey can I ask you question?"" so they stop and he starts asking them how much they're paying for their service plans and all.</p>

<p>Now, when it's busy on the sidewalk I just smile and mumble hello and keep going but once when it was just me on the sidewalk I couldn't avoid him so I kept walking and smiled awkwardly and he sarcastically said ""have a nice day!"" as I walked away and I felt like a heel. It's gotten to the point where I take a detour to avoid walking past that store now.</p>

<p>This actually happens with homeless persons too, ""hello sir can I ask you a question?"", which forces you to either be rude and ignore the person, making your next encounter more awkward, or actually stopping and being put on the spot.</p>

",16700,18-07-2018 15:13,Appropriate ways to dismiss street vendors?,"<p>In the Netherlands, it seems to be quite common lately to hire some students, put them on a busy main street or outside a supermarket, and have them target every passerby by asking 'Can I ask you something?'. </p>

<p>These people are always selling stuff I am not interested in (newspaper subscriptions, services that deliver food to your house every week) or they are trying you to sign up to become a permanent donor for a charity (in which I am also not interested). </p>

<p>My approach so far has always been:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not make eye contact</li>
<li>Continue walking without changing pace/trajectory (unless one jumps in front of me, then I swerve)</li>
<li>Reply 'You just did' (gentle, joking tone of voice, smile on my face) if they ask me 'Can I ask you something'</li>
</ul>

<p>Usually, this either generates a weird look if somebody doesn't get the joke, or a chuckle if they do. Even bystanders seem to like it. But yesterday, a lady came to me saying that what I was doing was very impolite. </p>

How to tell someone you don't trust that you are going to stick with written communication,"<p>At the start of the month I moved out of my old house which wasn’t working (hooray!) but the landlord still hasn’t given my damage deposit back (boo!). I sent the landlord a text message the day I moved out and only yesterday he contacted me asking questions about where I left my key etc. The landlord keeps sending me messages “contact me soon”. I think what he means is he wants me to give him a phone call. I have a bad feeling about where this is going because the landlord never made an appointment to inspect the room to see that no damage was done. However, I took pictures that show it was in good state. </p>

<p>Given that I do not trust the landlord based on his history, I would prefer all communications be done in writing so I have a paper trail. Is there a polite way to reply to his “contact me” message? Something like “given we are talking about several hundred dollars I’d prefer if we stick to email or text messages so there is a record”?</p>

How can I make my parents (and parents-in-law) accept that I don't want to have children?,"<p>First I would like to give a bit of context:</p>

<ul>
<li>My companion and I are 25 years old; we will probably get married in a few years</li>
<li>I luckily have a comfortable situation, and have been working for 2 years</li>
<li>My companion still has to study for 4 years (but she'll be working and will have an income)</li>
<li>I get on well with my in-laws, and things are okay with my own family</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I am an only son</li>
<li>My SO has a younger brother (16 years old) and an older brother (27 years old). Neither of them will ""provide"" (probably) grandchildren anytime soon. So this is a bit more pressure for my partner</li>
<li>Everyone here is French (a bit of Mediterranean/Spanish culture on my side)</li>
</ul>

<p>Recently, my parents-in-law suggested that now that my companion has almost finished her studies ""She should be ready to have kids soon"". On my side it's pretty much the same, I am expected to have kids since it is ""how things should be"", but there is a little less pressure.
My companion is not sure whether she'd like to ever have kids, and we have been hearing that ""We will change our minds"" over and over again.</p>

<p>Currently, the only real idea I can express is that the prospect of ever having kids does not make me happy, and that I don't want people around to pressure me into doing something I'll probably not change my mind about.</p>

<p>Has anyone encountered this problem and managed to make it accept to family without too much conflict?</p>

<p>I also have heard other ideas against my wish coming from aunts/uncles:</p>

<ul>
<li>""People who don't want kids don't like themselves"" -> That's not how I feel, do you know examples who might corroborate this idea?</li>
<li>""You won't be satisfied by life if you don't have kids"" -> I think my career, personal life and hobbies can largely be enough, am I wrong to think that? Is there a way to make our families feel the way we do about that?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></p>

<p>A comment rightfully suggested that I should add what I already tried. So here it is:</p>

<ul>
<li>I had the conversation about having (or not having) kids with my part of the family and tried the ""I just don't feel like having kids ever"" argument</li>
<li>It did not go well and escalated really quick, that's when I heard the arguments I am quoting in this question</li>

How do I get a friend's attention in a polite way when they're wearing headphones?,"<p>Very specific question, I know, but this is something I've thought about a lot as someone who frequently wears headphones in public and has to contact people in private with them on.</p>

<p>Often, when a friend/SO is wearing headphones I find it challenging to politely get their attention. I really dread when I don't notice and startle them, or when they aren't expecting me and I'm not sure how to proceed. I've tried tapping surfaces near them, approaching slowly, gentle contact, but nearly all of them seems to startle the listener unless they are prepared for interruption (and, to be fair, the same happens to me as well!).</p>

<p>I'm curious if there is an accepted way to get someone's attention when they're immersed in listening through their headphones.</p>

<p>Assume there is a polite and needed circumstance to contact the individual, and that they don't necessarily ""not want to be bothered""; they just simply aren't expecting to be contacted at that time. It's not good to break someone's boundaries when they don't want to be bothered, but assume a situation like one I've encountered before: friend says to come to their room whenever, but when approached, is listening to music.</p>

I pulled her earphones out of her ear and she looked at me really angrily for doing that, but I think I might have caught her earring or something. She then told me it hurt when I pulled her earphone out but I always pull mine out and I have never been hurt once so I don't know if she's telling the truth.</p>

<p>A few days later I needed her help again and patted her on the back and she said please don't touch me. In this situation I said sorry and she said it's fine but she doesn't like being touched (which is weird because when we go out for drinks after work her boyfriend is always touching her...)</p>

Managing and motivating a collaborator,"<p>I have a collaborator who is working with me on a project. I guess he is too slow not because he is not capable but rather afraid of doing mistakes (on the problem we are working on) and perhaps he procrastinates a lot. Because of this, the project is suffering immeasurably. We have passed all the pre-decided deadlines. How can I manage and motivate him without hurting him the least?</p>
",17145,31-07-2018 12:17,Get team member to participate in project,"<p>I am currently experiencing a very unpleasent situation. We are a group of 5, working on a software project for ""professional school"". We use <a href=""https://discordapp.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Discord</a> to organize us and to talk with each other.<br /> Everybody is doing his/her task and delivers on time, as well as communicates properly, except for one guy. </p>

<p>He takes days to respond to anything and does not deliver his tasks on the dates <strong>he promised</strong> to deliver. We are not yet in a hurry to finish the project, but it is annoying as hell to wait for 1 person to finish his task, so that the others can move to their next task.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Thursday morning I 'ping' him in Discord, asking how far he is with his task. No answer on Thursday, that's why I 'ping' again on Friday. Again no response. Someone else 'pings' him on Sunday, because he still didn't respond. On Monday we finally get a response, which states, that he is like 25% done with his task. On that Monday he tells us, that he will be done by Wednesday and promises to deliver. On Wednesday, we all wait for him to even show up to our group call (we have one every Wednesday for 1 hour so that everyone actually works on the project at least once a week. This call was previously on Mondays), but he didn't show and didn't deliver his work. Then finally on the next Monday he delivered his work, which only he can understand.</p>

<p>Tomorrow (Wednesday) we have a group call again to which he hopefully shows up and explains how to use his work. I already 'pinged' him 2 times since Monday, giving him a task which only he can complete as he knows how to work with what he delivered, but yet I didn't get a response.</p>

<p>He is knowledgeable with Discord, and he is online often enough to read it, but he doesn't/ignores it. Everyone is expected to work at least 1 hour per week, but more is better. The other group members are annoyed by him as well.</p>

<p><strong>My question:</strong></p>

<p>How can I ""force"" him to deliver the work everyone is waiting for as well as answers within a timely manner?</p>

<p>Note that I do not care if I have to be unfriendly. My goal is to get the message accross and have it stay in his head. Also note that the whole interaction we have as a group is online through Discord (text-chat as well as voice-chat). We can't contact the teacher until the next school block, by which the project should be finished. I would assume that we are required to handle this on our own as part of our apprenticeship.</p>

<p>I don't think that location is important, but for reference, this is taking place in Germany.</p>

<p>As many people suggest on how to deal with the situation overall, I want to clarify that it is not really what I am looking for.</p>

<p>Yesterday though, the gym was pretty well visited. Thus I had to work in on the same machine with this guy (he did his set and while he takes a break I did my mine, and so on) so none of us had to wait.</p>

<p>Thing is, he was doing a slightly different exercise than me and then tried to convince me to do this exercise too, because to him it seems superior. I tried to tell him I'd rather do the exercise I normally do but he kept on talking about the benefits, which annoyed me a lot.</p>

<p>I hate it when people try to talk me into something which clearly is not on my current workout routine or try to correct my form.

<p>So, there is this (big) guy at the gym. He is 210cm and 105Kg (~6'11&quot; and 230 lbs) which makes him look like a mountain, but he seems to not understand that not everyone is naturally as big as he is.</p>
<p>I wouldn't have asked the question if this was only about me, but yesterday was infernal for everyone.</p>
<p>He uses a lot of space in the gym, he speaks very loud and most of all he looks at everyone and comments on absolutely e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g, which makes people feel really uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Yesterday a girl had to move away from him because she could not stand his behavior anymore (watching &amp; commenting). It was the first time I saw that girl and she was so upset that she told me.</p>
<p>The problem is that you can't say anything to him because he will just deny it <strong>and</strong> take anything as a personal attack. Every time you're not agreeing with him, his face shows that he is pissed off and he raises his voice.</p>
<p>I can't really involve the staff in this since there is only one employee, the boss of the gym. He is friends with the guy and he doesn't like people complaining. So, there's not really anyone around that knows how to properly lift weights that I can involve in this.</p>
<h2>Concrete situation</h2>
<p>I was bench pressing. He came in front of me just to watch. Once I was done, he said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You should try to bring your elbows as close as possible to your body.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I said that I was doing it properly and that I don't want to try anything else because I just want to enjoy my training safely (mainly if it sounds really bad, which in this case, was in fact bad to do).</p>
<p>I think that he just wanted, in this situation, to make me look like a weak man in front of two girls that were staying close to us, because he said it out loud.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Him:</strong> Try it and you won't lift as much as you think you can.</p>
<p>(Then he just proceeded to bench press on my towel without asking if I want him to show me.)</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Okay, thank you, but I don't want to change my routine. I am just enjoying my training.</p>
<p><strong>Him:</strong> Well, if you always do what you want you won't progress, but whatever, do what you want.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After that he did go talk to another person to tell them how to work out, but for the rest of my training he did not stop checking out how my friend and I were training.</p>
<h2>Question</h2>
<p>I have been lifting for years and I just want to train peacefully now, so I would like to be able to respond well to people like him. I don't think that they are bad people, they just don't understand how toxic they are sometimes.</p>

I don't think the forgetting is malicious, it's just that habits are hard to break and reform. It doesn't help that I occasionally skip out on my chores myself, but I do it much less frequently and ""catch up"" with missed chores much sooner. It is a lot harder for me to keep up with my part when the house is already messy as well. Mess in our house seems to have a way of begetting more and more mess. And the lingering mess creates stress for both of us.</p>

<p>I don't wish to be a nag and just remind me partner about every dirty dish, every loose sock, every little bit of paper, etc. Frankly, I wouldn't have the energy to exercise such vigilance: The constant badgering about tiny chores would be a chore in and of itself to me! Even if I were able to have the tenacity to nag about every single thing, this still doesn't help with chores skipped when I'm not around, or when a chore has been skipped but my partner won't be home for a while.</p>

<p>There some similar questions posted already, but they seem different from mine in that the chore-dodger does not want to be doing the chores in the first place. I view my situation as the next level of this: My partner does want to break the bad habit of not doing chores, but it is proving difficult in practice. So what steps can I take that would be effective in helping my partner accomplish this goal?</p>

<p>Note: This has been going on for more than a year, and although there's been some improvement, it's very little in the grand scheme of getting from a messy house that requires devoting every other weekend to ""spring cleaning"" to a not-messy house which requires a more modest amount of maintenance. So I wonder if ""just hang in there and be supportive"" is perhaps not a sufficient solution by itself.</p>
",17950,24-08-2018 22:48,How can I ask my wife to share more of our responsibilities?,"<p>I feel like too much of the responsibilities of being an adult fall on my shoulders, and that my wife does a lot more taking than giving in that regard. I would like our relationship to be more of an equal partnership where I feel that I benefit from it too. Don't get me wrong, I love her dearly, and the romantic side of our relationship is pretty good, but there's also a practical side of two adults living together and that's where I feel like I get a raw deal.</p>

<p>We had a big fight this morning over the silliest thing, because she was upset at me for not refilling the coffee maker after using it (which is not a thing in our house, I usually have to refill it in the morning before I use it myself.) But it really struck a raw nerve for me, and opened up an argument about how I want her to do more around the house.</p>

<p>I'm ten years into my career, and I've been quite successful at it. She's just starting out. I work 60+ hours a week, she works about 35. The difference in income is more than 10x. She keeps her money that she earns to herself and uses it for personal things, and I pay for all of our expenses, rent, food, vacations, eating out, etc., plus I give her a monthly stipend that she can spend how she likes. Given the difference in our income, I don't mind that so much - I feel she could contribute in other ways.</p>

<p>I handle the garbage, the supermarket, and the finances, bills, and taxes. I manage to get 1-3 hours each evening before bed, plus half a day off each weekend to spend with her. In order to work as much as I do and still do all of that, I have no life or friends outside of work and marriage. It's hardly balanced, but I'm happy enough like that because I know I'm working towards an early retirement and secure future for my wife and I and our future kids.</p>

<p>I think if she could just keep our tiny 500 sqft apartment clean, and have supper in the fridge for ~5 days a week (which should mean cooking 2-3 times a week.) that would be the minimum contribution. I don't think that's too much to ask.</p>

<p>In reality she gets home from work tired, spends some time unwinding with her smartphone, and then spend 1-3 hours with me watching netflix or other activities. Then she'll often stay up late on her phone again, and I go to bed early because I get up at 4:30 and start work. She gets up late, gets ready and goes straight to work.</p>

<p>The dishes pile up, the kitchen, floors, and surfaces get dirty and accumulate junk. It gets worse all week until near the end of the weekend when she finally makes an effort to do something about it. It's a good week when the apartment is relatively clean by the time the next week begins, but that's rare. She cooks about as often as I do, which is maybe once every two weeks. I got fed up last weekend and spent a couple hours vacuuming and packing things away, but I really don't have time for that.</p>

<p>If she can't pull her weight now, how would things be when we have children together? When we have a larger place and all the demanding needs of children? The thought terrifies me because I can't take any additional responsibility, and I'm scared I'll end up having to carry most of that alone too. There's no take-backs on the decision to have children.</p>

<p>I need things to change soon and gain some level of confidence that I won't be alone in this before it comes time to start a family. I don't know how to approach it. We argue over this a couple times a year but nothing ever really changes. There are some short term changes, and then that terrible smartphone comes out again and things start to degenerate until we're back to where we were.</p>

<p>I know it's hard to paint an accurate picture of a marriage in just a few words, and harder still given you only are getting my side of things. But I'm really at the end of my rope here and I don't know what else to do.</p>

<p><strong>How can I ask my wife to share more of our responsibilities, in a way that encourages long-term changes?</strong></p>

"How do I prevent a ""conspiracy theory fan"" father from putting me down?","<h3>Me</h3>
<p>I live in a large city and have done so my whole student life and now career. I studied science at university and have two degrees. Through work and studies, I've lived a large chunk of my life abroad so speak French and German fluently and to an outsider, I'd probably be seen as a &quot;metropolitan liberal&quot;. I like to discuss things: I can discuss a topic for hours, probably even enjoy a conversation with someone who disagrees with me, rather than someone who shares exactly the same opinion, so we can share different points of view. Due to that,</p>
<p>I rarely make statements with full certitude and do not mind showing a bit of doubt in my claims. Although that could be seen as lack of confidence, actually I'm fairly confident in what I know/don't know. In general, I'm more of a listener than a talker but enjoy talking about matters that I feel I have something useful to share about i.e. I'm not the kind of person that dominates a conversation but when I have something important to say, you'll hear from me.</p>
<p>I struggle to tolerate stereotypes and generalisations, I think that most things in life are more nuanced and that understanding the general characteristics of a country or a person is important but that deep understanding requires a more nuanced approach. In the same way, I'm not entirely against talking about conspiracy theories and similar. They can be &quot;entertaining&quot; but that if you want to suggest that the Americans didn't land on the moon, you certainly can't make such a statement with more confidence than anyone can make a statement that they did: science is as much about determining what you don't know than it is about what you know.</p>
<h3>My father</h3>
<p>My father is very different, he left school and home at 17. He's a smart, switched-on man so I think he has always been keen to prove his knowledge: he likes quizzes and general trivia, reading up on things: he's a fan of popular &quot;science&quot; books. He lives in a small town. He may be described as someone who &quot;likes the sound of his own voice&quot;.</p>
<p>He likes to make bold statements and gets very frustrated if anyone questions anything he states. As he doesn't have a &quot;traditional&quot; education, I sometimes feel he tries to replace it with trivia, popularized science and has a thing for conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>For example, my father may talk about a conspiracy theory in which a coincidence is seemingly so &quot;unbelievable&quot; that it proves some dark forces are behind it, when in effect it can be explained through general probability i.e. an event that has a 1 in 5000 chance of happening, if it happens, is nothing more than a funny coincidence.</p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>Most of the time I will just avoid even talking when my father starts talking about such matters as I know that he doesn't really want to hear anything I have to say. He just wants someone to nod along. But even when staying quiet, <strong>he will throw in a few personal attacks like &quot;You university-educated people wouldn't understand this&quot; or &quot;People like you from the metropolitan elite, disconnected from reality, can't understand this&quot;, which makes it difficult to stay quiet.</strong> Remaining quiet doesn't seem to work for me.</p>
<p>Since I'm aware that someone who keeps interjecting and weakening someone's statements is very annoying, I will very rarely, if at all, &quot;temper&quot; his statements like that but on occasion, I feel the need to provide a more nuanced view. Whenever I make a reply that presents a slightly different perspective, it will annoy him incredibly. For example, he may say that Americans all have right-wing views apart from the &quot;metropolitan elite&quot; of course, and having lived in Vermont, I will mention that the State tends to be on the left side of the political spectrum, and he'll be very annoyed. On the few occasions that I have felt strongly enough to present a completely opposing view, this has been enough for us to fall out.</p>
<p>He has put me down in front of my wife and family in the past and to avoid conflict I've had to just stay quiet. I think he is aware of that and exploits it. On one occasion when I pointed out that he was being disrespectful he jokingly said that he's allowed to be disrespectful as he's my father.</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder that if I paid less attention to what he was actually saying and then just steered the conversation in the direction I wanted, there would be fewer opportunities to really disagree on anything.</p>
<p><strong>How do I prevent such a person from putting me down during our conversations,  considering that he's my father?</strong></p>
",18012,28-08-2018 00:42,How to tell someone believing in pseudoscience & conspiracy theories is wrong without making them feel stupid/upset?,"<p>A close family member of mine is a raw vegan, anti vaxer, anti-antibiotics, anti-fluoride, believes in chemtrails, has a machine that filters water and makes it alkaline, eats lots of supplements, buys only organic produce and buys all her hygiene, beauty and cleaning products at the holistic store. </p>

<p>Overall, her health isn't great, and whenever she gets ill she blames it on something she ate or the chemicals in the air... </p>

<p>In my opinion, she is not nourishing her body properly, and I'm worried that piggybacking all the supplements and miracle treatments is not only ineffective but detrimental to her health. It also worries me she would only go to the doctor as her last resort, and even when she gets a prescription, she wouldn't always take the meds. She says she prefers to fight the illness naturally and have a stronger immune system as a result :( </p>

<p>If I say something she believes in is wrong, she gets upset. So I try to logic her out of her beliefs, but she would rather tell me I have a very linear and mathsy way of thinking (since I am a physicist), therefore I can't possibly understand her ""facts"". This makes me so sad as she would trust me with physics, yet somehow in an argument about biology, chemistry, ""toxins"", and vaccines my use of pure logic and critical thinking goes over her head. </p>

<p>On the other hand, she has read books on those topics which are popular science at best and complete garbage at worse. None of those come close to even high school textbook standard - she might as well be reading tabloid articles in book format. Sadly, she feels her arguments are more valid since she has read books with things like  ""adjuvant"",  ""metabolism"" and ""blood-brain barrier"" written in them. That's enough for her to deem them reputable sources of the truth behind such and such.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder... If I had the time and the willpower to read all she has read on this: would she then listen to me? Or would she keep arguing?</p>

<p>Anyway, this person is important to me and I hate our constant arguments. I hate that I hide my chocolate &amp; pretend to be vegan in front of her to avoid upsetting her. I wish we could just enjoy some lunch out in town without hearing things like ""that sandwich must have been packed with sugar and gluten because I feel so bad now"" for a week afterward, even though her test for gluten sensitivity came out negative. And most important of all I want to make sure she isn't unwittingly ruining her health.</p>

How to ask my roommate/good friend if they are unhappy because I did not meet their expectation of me (as a roommate)?,"<h1>The Story</h1>

<p>To give a bit of background, me and my good friend of almost 7-8 years have been attending the same university. After our first year, both of us, along with two mutual acquaintances, chose to live together in apartment. We currently live in an off-campus, four person apartment in a semi-urban setting. </p>

<p>In addition, I am a very busy person. I take a large number of credits, I am pursuing a dual major, and I partake in extracurricular activities that take up a large portion of my time. On a regular weekday, I wake up around 4:30am, leave the house, and return sparingly until about 5:30-7:30pm, after which I spend an hour doing work, only to go to bed at 9:00pm. This was the case last year as well.</p>

<p>And lastly, my friend also <em>(I think)</em> had 'high' expectations of the four of us living together. He would frequently tell me during the summer about many things they hoped we would do together, like cooking together, hanging out, and going on trips. I didn't want to shut down these expectations, but I made a concerted effort to remind them of how little time we will practically have (due to the large amount of schoolwork during the semester).</p>

<p>So, when we arrived, we did hang out quite a bit, and cooked a bit, and did do some trips, as expected. However, as soon as my semester started heating up, I obviously spent less and less time at home, and told my friend and roommates accordingly, letting them know I couldn't hang out with them because I was busy due to X, Y, Z, etc.</p>

<h1>The Issue</h1>

<p>Now, after the first few weeks of settling in, the few times I am home and my friend is home, I get a 'cold shoulder' or avoided. I say hi, ask how are they doing, I ask them if they want to join me when I am playing video games when I am playing with other friends online, I get either no response, an indiscernible mumble, or ignored. </p>

<p>The problem is that I am worried my friend is unhappy because their expectation of me as a roommate was not met, especially by me spending very little time in the apartment as well as not joining him for some of the activities he likes to do. </p>

<p>To make matters worse, I suspect he does not like me using some of the little time I <em>do</em> have to do stuff with people other than him, such as playing my favorite video game <em>(I do not ask him to join because he does not like the game)</em> with other online friends of mine. The only guess I have is that he is taking me not hanging out with him as me not liking him anymore, not enjoying his company, etc.</p>

",18145,01-09-2018 19:00,How to talk to my sister about not spending as much time with her?,"<p>Background: </p>

<p>Growing up, I was always close with my sister because I spent a lot of time with her and told her everything. As I grew older and went to college, I began spending less time with her and our relationship went through peaks and valleys. About six months ago, I moved in with my sister and her husband (they live close to my university and I have one more year to complete) in order to save money which I was very grateful for. When I spend a lot of time with my sister and her husband and their friends, things are great. She is really nice and loving and fun to be around. Her friends and I don't have much in common so I prefer to spend time with my own but I will on occasion hang out with them. </p>

<p>Problem: </p>

<p>Even though I live with my sister, I'm rarely home. I work full time for an engineering company during the summer, I have a boyfriend, I also work in a lab, and I like to hang out with my friends a couple evenings a week since I can in the summer. My sister does not understand this at all. She gets very upset with me when I'm not home frequently. She will call and talk about me to my parents and other siblings and treat me with a very cold attitude when I do come home. If I don't hang out with her friends she gets upset too. If she calls me that night and I don't come home to spend time with her and her friends because of a previous commitment, she will be angry when I see her again. This gives me anxiety to even see her or come home to the place I live. </p>

My girlfriend and her weight,"<p>My girlfriend is chubby. I don't mind this. I like chubby girls, I find her very attractive as she is. She wears her weight very well. </p>

<p>She's decided to lose weight. </p>

<p>How can I be supportive of her decision and her progress without making it seem that it's a determination of her attractiveness, or my opinion on her body? </p>

<p>I'm trying to find ways to compliment her by acknowledging the weight loss as well as just her in general. Currently, I've been very separate in these compliments (I'm trying to make sure that when I tell her how good she looks, I'm not tying it to her weight loss. I want her to stop when she feels comfortable or happy, I don't want her to think that I want her to continue for my sake, or that I'll only find her more attractive if she does). </p>

<p>When I tell her about her weight loss, I'm usually saying things about how her clothes look looser or how she's much lighter (she's actually getting smaller but not much lighter, so I've been working out so I can give her the illusion that she's lighter, even if the scales aren't really showing it too much. She's gaining muscle, so her mass is equaling out) </p>

<p>I feel that I may be overthinking this whole thing, but I'm just trying to make sure I walk this carefully. </p>

<p>I just want to make sure the words I give her are the best words I can. I want her to be happy about her weight loss, but not make her feel it's important for our relationship. It's for her. But I also want to make her feel sexy because of all the effort. </p>

It makes no difference to me, and it's her body anyway, I have no say in the matter even if I did have an opinion. How do I respond when she brings up the topic, so that it doesn't come across like I'm either being unsupportive of her efforts or telling her she needs to lose weight? </p>

I usually just ignore them because it’s not worth the effort of entering a discussion with the person who shared the post and don’t cause much harm IMO.</p>

<p>However sometimes these posts are dangerous because they give bad medical advice, such as the posts about so-called “<a href=""https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/medical/ask-the-experts/cough-cpr"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cough CPR</a>”. A quick Google will usually take you to a site like <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com"">Skeptics.SE</a> or Snopes.com which has the facts.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>However I don’t want to be the person that’s always telling people they’re wrong, even if they are, as often the posts are shared with good intentions.</p>

<p>My usual response is replying in group <em>""It's a hoax""</em> and just that. Back then there were far more shares which I instantly recognize as hoax, which I stayed silent, and I just recently started to reply.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>After I replied in the group, I sent a message roughly like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I believe you send the news in good faith. I don't have anything personal. I just don't like ""chain message"" like that.</p>

  <p>I just want to share information. If you don't like it just don't read it. I think it's a good thing to share positive information. <em>If you think I was wrong, sorry.</em><sub>The last part is clearly not an apology (in Indonesian)</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>She is not a close friend, but we are in the small circle of religious group (which is the chat for). We're in good terms (until today), but certainly my response has offended her.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>How should I respond when someone shared a news/article which I can then prove it's a hoax?</strong></p>

<p>So far, no one responded to shares (only those relevant to our activity are commented), and usually the group is free from chit-chat. No one responded to my disagreement.</p>

<p>My goal is to communicate to members that sharing is encouraged, but first filter out hoaxes from the group. I am <strong>just a member</strong>. Contacting the group admin should only be a last resort, as I don't want this to be a rule. I want people to do themselves a favor, and educate themselves.</p>

<hr>

<p>It's very easy to recognize these type of suspicious broadcast. Someone with a common sense should be able to recognize suspicious clues immediately. However, it seems a lot of sharers just hit share button without even finish reading it.</p>

How to make a friend stop his racists jokes?,"<p>I am in a group of friends of 5 people. We're all white, male, in our mid to late twenties. The group was formed from working together on the same group projects at the university. Obviously, over time, friendships are formed and the level of comfort within the group increases. It is common to make jokes amongst ourselves and just talk about random topics. </p>

<p>Lately, I've begun to notice that one member (let's call him Bob) of the group tends to occasionally make racially insensitive remarks. They haven't been necessarily malicious but they are of quite poor taste. Now, I understand that sometimes people let loose in a group of friends and make jokes that you maybe wouldn't make anywhere else, however it makes me feel uncomfortable and even embarrassed whenever Bob makes the jokes that he has been making.</p>

<p>Couple of examples:</p>

<p>1) Another friend (Charlie) was approached in the gym by a black woman offering to play ping-pong with him. From what Charlie said, the woman seemed to have an unusual laugh and voice which made Charlie laugh and tell us all about in the group chat, which in itself is fine - sometimes you meet a person that has a weird trait and it makes you laugh, fine. However, when discussing the matter, Bob jumped in and felt it was necessary to bring that woman's skin color into the discussion. He went as far as comparing the woman to an ape and then making a generalization that all black people are apes. - Not only does it feel in extremely poor taste but also ignorant. Humans have all evolved from apes so why was there a need to say specifically that black people are apes?</p>

<p>2) A slightly vulgar comic was shared in our group chat about a white farmer molesting his sheep. Bob didn't appreciate the comic because it was ""factually incorrect"". He felt like the skin color of the farmer was not accurate. He didn't specify which skin color it should've been but made it clear that the skin color of the farmer should be changed for the comic to be funny.</p>

<p>We all live in Europe in the same city so growing up we weren't really exposed to diversity. However, you would think that someone obtaining their master's degree would have a little bit more sense and acceptance in them. Not only are Bob's racial jokes unfunny and offensive, they also make him sound ignorant and like a racist. I also feel embarrassed for him because I feel like if anyone outside from our group saw those jokes, they would think Bob is a moron and by association so would everyone else in the group.</p>

<p>The other people in the group do not seem to be bothered by it. They don't encourage Bob but they surely don't make it known that the jokes are in poor taste. Generally they insert a generic smiley as a reaction to those jokes.</p>

<p>I've made it known that I am bothered by these jokes (specifically said it after the 1st example). As expected, the response was that I'm overreacting and people are just having fun. Any further Bob's jokes, I've just ignored to make it clear that I want no part in that.</p>

<p>So the question is, how am I supposed to deal with that kind of person? Bob is actually a nice person most of the time and his jokes are often funny, it's just that those specific jokes really bother me. So, how can I make Bob stop those racist jokes? </p>

<p>I have been in this company for 5 months now and I'm sharing an office with four men (35 to 55 y.o.). They all are white, heterosexual cis men. For the record I'm a white, 22 y.o., heterosexual cis woman<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>There's been a viral video in France in the beginning of July where <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXCyOR8lNGU"" rel=""noreferrer"">a bunch of people discuss non-binary and LGBTQ+ discrimination</a>. At the beginning of the debate the facilitator address these people as <em>gentlemen</em>, to which one of them responds: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What makes you think I'm a man? </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>Since this video was released my coworkers are making fun of them and making jokes about being non-binary. I do not want to repeat them here, but they are deeply offensive and spreads threats towards LGBTQ+ people. It goes very far most of the time.<br>
They joke about it <strong>during work time</strong>, in the office, <strong>twice a day</strong> (and for 30+ minutes) since last week. Most of the time I put my earphones in so as not to participate<sup>2</sup> (because I am shy and I struggle to be heard in debates and every time I confront them, they laugh at me and tell me my opinion is stupid), but this week they called me to get engaged in their LGBT-phobic conversation and jokes. It seemed like they wouldn't listen to me when I insinuate it's offensive and makes me uncomfortable (because I am a hetero cis woman), and I really want them to stop spreading those awful jokes while at work (at least when I'm nearby).</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p><strong>What can I do to try to get my coworkers to stop their <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/LGBTphobia"" rel=""noreferrer"">LGBT-phobic</a> conversation during work time?</strong><br>
I would like to avoid confrontational suggestions if possible, since I'm gonna be around for a while and I would like to maintain a cordial atmosphere despite our differences of opinions.</p>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>They often start debates (most of the time on topics involving racism / homophobia / rape apology / ...). I'm bothered by the fact they do this during work time but mostly by their opinions themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>My manager doesn't know about it, but they're not managing all of us. </p></li>
<li><p>Yesterday I told them that my mom is non-binary<sup>1</sup> after a very offensive and inappropriate joke. They were saying that LGBTQ+ people are freaks and that we should get rid of all of them, so I just ""dropped the bomb"". They laughed at me and went on. This made me really mad so I just put my earphones back on and didn't talk to them for the rest of the day, but it persisted for at least 30 other minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Those are not ""just jokes"". They actually stand by the opinion held by their jokes. But TBH their hatred seems to be based more on ignorance and fear than real knowledge of LGBTQ+ ""world"", if I may.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm not trying to change their opinion. I surely don't agree with them, but it is not my place to try to change their mind, plus I'm not sure I could even change something. I'd just like them to stop uttering death-threatening jokes towards one specific part of the population during work time.</p></li>

<p><sup><sup>1</sup>: My mother does not consider herself a trans woman. She is what we call in French an ftoX, namely ""female to unknown"". There's no such thing in French as the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they"" rel=""noreferrer"">neutral they</a> (well, it's only starting with the ""iel"" pronoun but people fight not to use it), so we make a difference between (fe-)male (which stands for the sex) and (wo-)man (for the gender).

How to jump into a group which is standing in a circle?,"<p>OK, so I just moved to a new town, and I want to make some friends.</p>

<p>I am Christian, so I expect that I should be able to just jump into a church and meet all kinds of people there. After church people tend to talk and make plans to be social during the week, and the church communities tend to have parties where they talk and eat, etc.. </p>

<p>I've tried a couple of churches, and I noticed a common behavior among them. They always stand in these semi-circles or circles while they talk (usually about 3-7 people in a circle), and since I don't really know anyone, I don't know how to join the circles. I assume this is normal behavior for people who know each other; I've observed similar behaviors at parties in the past. My response to this, so far, has been to awkwardly walk around the room or look at my phone, listening for an opening that I can jump in on.</p>

<p>Typically, the conversations they have pertain to pop culture or shared experiences. I figure I need to join the group before I can have shared experiences, so my only hope is to attempt to contribute something to a conversation about pop culture. But I'm a huge nerd. These days I'm spending my free time reading Josephus, Tertulian, and Plato, and I don't know how to talk about pop-culture. </p>

How can I communicate to my wife my concerns about her spending habits?,"<p>Some context to begin with: My wife and I have been married for two years now. I earn around 2500€ after taxes, and she used to earn around 1500€ after taxes. We both share one bank account, by the way.</p>

<p>I come from a working-class family. While I wouldn't describe us as ""poor"", reckless spending was frowned upon. Larger investments were discussed and alternatives sought after. Impulse purchases were limited to very small amounts (e.g. a bottle of Cola).</p>

<p>She also comes from a working-class family, but with far less responsible parents. Her parents divorced during her childhood. Her father, who raised her, spends money without any thought for the future or savings. This always lead to them having financial trouble at the end of each month. Her mother doesn't exhibit any care for the future either. A while ago, she took a loan for a luxury car, which she would never be able to pay off. All her money goes into that car, yet she claims that she is doing just fine.</p>

<h1>What has happened</h1>

<p>My wife recently decided (without asking me about my opinion), to switch from a 40h/week position to a 20h/week position, bringing her overall income down significantly.</p>

<p>At the same time, her spending habits have increased significantly. During may, she spent almost 1500€ on various luxury goods like perfume, shoes, clothes, etc.</p>

<p>When asking her about it, she responded dismissively at first, akin to ""That's all in your imagination. I don't spend more than usual."". When I then showed her how much she was actually spending, she then claimed that I should ""Let her have some nice things"".</p>

<p>I'm afraid that this behavior could intensify, leading her to spend ever increasing amounts of money for unnecessary things. Furthermore, I feel a bit hurt from her assertion that I wouldn't let her have ""nice things"". I personally feel like spending a quarter of your monthly income on one pair of shoes leaves the realm of ""nice things"" and starts becoming irresponsible. It's as if I would spend 625€ on a bottle of wine.</p>

",21911,29-05-2019 13:08,How can I get my wife to be less spendthrift?,"<p>I am married for 15+ years and working at an Indian technology company.</p>

<p>These days, layoffs have been so frequent in my industry; for instance at my company they happened twice in the last three years. Thus, I've always been worrying for the last 4-5 years if I can secure my job until retirement.</p>

<p>I come from a middle class background and my wife is from a poor family; she struggled for good food in her childhood. She is not working; my salary is the only source of income.</p>

<p>Every 2-4 weeks, she comes up with shopping plans for mostly <em>high-end</em> items, such as variety of dresses, cosmetics, fancy restaurants, gold jewelry, etc.</p>

<p>She never talks about savings, budget plans, taking care of the two kids' future, etc.</p>

<p>I used to refuse at first, and after a long argument, I'm eventually forced to buy what she asks for. </p>

<p>What I've tried already (throughout our entire marriage):</p>

<ul>
<li>(when we both are in a good mood) Calmly explaining to her the importance of savings and approximate amount needed for kids' study, their marriage, our retirement life, unexpected health issues, etc.</li>
<li>(when I'm in a bad mood) Arguing and shouting at her</li>
<li>Whenever hearing about people struggling for money, pointing to her and saying to the effect of, ""we should not suffer like this in the future, please take care""</li>
<li>Giving her a fixed budget when going out for that day shopping. She usually agrees at home, but most of the time she goes on to ask for items that exceed the budget and nags me to buy it. This makes me feel cheated and sometimes I shout at her at either home or the shop itself.</li>
<li>Allocating a <em>monthly</em> budget. Most of the time she comes back around the 20th of each month demanding 25-30% extra. Raising the budget every six months also didn't help.</li>
</ul>

<p>(""most of the time"" above refers to 70% of the time)</p>

<p>Her usual reply is that this spending is ""important"" or that it's a fundamental part of life.</p>

<p>I've tried each of these approaches dozens of times. I'm tired of continuously having to repeat myself and very stressed out and irritable these days. Even after I've explained this fact to her multiple times, things are not improving.</p>

<p>I already shared her about my layoff fear, but even it doesn't help.</p>

<p>We went to family counseling for about a year in 2012, but things got worse once we stopped it.</p>

How can I not agressively let my friend know I don't want to be hugged/touched?,"<p>I have a friend with whom I was very, very close in the past. We would hug often (as a greeting/goodbye, but those kinds of long hugs); we would be sitting together and it would happen that our legs/arms would touch (he takes a lot of space as a tal, athletic guy) and that would be the norm.</p>

<p>We have since had a falling out of sorts. Not an agressive one, but I definitely feel differently about our friendship, and have told him so. However, he keeps coming for a hug everytime we see each other; but I don't want to hug him (although I also don't want to hurt his feelings...) so I kind of just let myself be (awkwardly) hugged. Same goes for casual touch; I don't want him leaning against me so I duck out, or just shift so our bodies are as far away as possible, and it is awkward, and stressful for me.</p>

The problem is this: People, especially relatives, ask you stuff about their computer-related problems, for example: ""What kind of anti-virus program should I install?"" or the much more frequently asked ""Can you cleanup my PC?"" one. I really dislike such questions, because they have nothing to do with what I study or what I will do for a living in my career later on. Also, it sucks that some family members or even my landlord assume I can help them just because I study computer science.</p>

<p>It feels like others are totally ignorant and just assume you are a genius and know everything about anything related to something about ""computers"", regardless of what it is. This gets especially interesting if you get questions about rather exotic programs that you have never even seen yourself beforehand.</p>

How to get friends(s) to confirm for certain if they are attending or not?,"<p>I think this is a fairly common situation. When trying to arrange something, some people don't like to commit so they say ""maybe"". This is a problem, because space may be limited or reservations may need to be made.</p>

<p>Here is an example. I would like to go to a concert. I asked a friend who said ""he should be able to come"". If he's not able or doesn't want to come, that's fine, I will ask someone else. I just want a straight answer. How can I get this? </p>

<p>It gets even more complicated when a group is involved. At college I invited a few friends (who didn't know each other) to join me at the pub. Two showed up. They had entirely opposite personalities that weren't really compatible and they didn't like each other. This is another reason I like to know in advance who is coming. Though I do feel a bit immature in this line of thinking?</p>

<p>I don't think this is the same as <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/24024/"">How to get somebody&#39;s confirmation when they say &quot;I&#39;ll check my schedule&quot;?</a> because it focuses on people saying ""I need to check my schedule"".

How to become friends again with a girl I confessed my feelings to?,"<p>I have a friend who I have known for a long time. We are not good friends necessarily, due to the fact that we had just reconnected a couple of weeks ago.</p>

<p>A couple of days ago I confessed to her that I have feelings for her and she told me that she had just gotten back with her ex recently. The following day I texted her saying that I would still love to be friends to which she replied that she never intended to stop being my friend and that she was happy I felt comfortable enough to tell her.</p>

<p>Now we are still friends, but things have been awkward between us. She's not entirely avoiding or ignoring me, but she doesn't talk to me as much, and she no longer goes out of her way to walk home with me from school, which is very understandable since I put her in a weird situation. Besides that, we are still trying to be friends. For example just yesterday she drove me to school, but when I was in the car with her we barely spoke, and it felt so awkward. </p>

<p>I really want to confront her about it, but I don't know how. I am not the only one who wants to stay friends with her, she wants to be friends with me as well, but we are stuck in an awkward situation, and I’m afraid talking to her might make it worse. I have known her for 8 years and I don't want to lose her because of something I said. </p>

",24061,05-02-2020 13:38,How can I again be on friendly terms with a girl I have a crush on since she's avoiding me after I gave her a small gift?,"<p>I've met a girl in my department at university, and although I wasn't initially interested in her, she would often laugh at my dumbest jokes and flash me unwarranted smiles, so I thought perhaps she might be interested in me. We traveled to a conference together and thus had quite a lot of time to chat and get to know each other. She even agreed to go out to dinner with me one night, and we enjoyed ourselves and discovered that we both like many of the same things, from food to art to music and more. (Several weeks later, we returned to a subject of conversation from that night, and to my surprise, she was able to quote verbatim some of the things I told her over dinner!) I ended up paying for the cab+dinner, and despite my protests, she promised to pay me back.</p>

<p>It took her a long time and a lot of effort to find the cash to pay me back, because she's an international student and the closest branch of her bank is far from our small university town. As a token of gratitude and to express my affection, I decided to do something special for her: I purchased some high-quality looseleaf tea, stitched my own teabags, and gave it to her as a little handmade gift. To my horror, she seemed very disgruntled by the gift. I didn't get a chance to explain why I gave the gift: she took it, smiled, said ""thanks I'll try it"" and practically ran away. Ever since, she has been extremely awkward around me, averting her gaze, avoiding me every chance she can get, not responding to emails, refusing to initiate conversations with me, and abruptly ending conversations that I try to start with her. She has not mentioned what she thought of the tea or if she even tried it. However, she seems to be on very good terms with the other students in the department.</p>

<p>I'm very concerned that I have somehow offended this girl or made her uncomfortable, and I don't know how to proceed. I feel like I should forget about her, but I'm confused and depressed about how her apparent interest in me has evaporated so quickly. At this point, I'm having trouble deciding whether I should:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Leave her alone and never speak to her again. This is highly undesirable, but maybe she'd be happiest if I vanished from her life.</p></li>
<li><p>Apologize. This seems like it would make the situation even more awkward.</p></li>
<li><p>Pretend it never happened, and after giving her time and space, continue to interact with her as before, with the intention of one day telling her how I feel about her. I guess this is the ideal scenario for me.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But my friend says she tells me about her problem not expecting a solution from me.</p>

<p>I'm confused. Please help.</p>
",24074,06-02-2020 12:49,How to get spouse to empathetically listen to problems instead of offering solutions?,"<p>My spouse and I have a recurring problem. I will try to talk about my day, which may include a tough problem that has been frustrating me. <strong>Before I've even had a chance to explain what is going on</strong>, he will offer solution, which may or may not solve the problem. We then up arguing over whether the solution will work or not, and he gets mad that I'm criticizing his advice, and I get frustrated because I didn't even <em>want</em> advice; I just wanted to share about my day! Whether I agree or disagree with his advice, he expects me to simply thank him  (and presumably drop the topic since it is now ""solved""). He claims he doesn't care if I actually act on the advice, but he doesn't want to discuss it after it's given. He doesn't understand why I object to this arrangement, despite my repeated attempts to explain it, and I'm unsure how to change that.</p>

<p>What I actually <em>want</em> when sharing a frustrating problem/experience is some empathy, for him to understand and be aware of what I'm struggling with, and for him to generally show that he cares and is interested in what is going on in my life. It's the same thing I want when sharing <em>any</em> experience with someone I care about. The fact that it's a problematic experience instead of a happy one is irrelevant. If I want advice, then I'll ask for it, but typically the problems I'm talking about are complex enough that there's no easy solution (or I'd have figured it out myself).</p>

<p>The things I've tried:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Modeling the response I want when he shares experiences/problems with me (which he has confirmed he enjoys more than me giving him advice, but it hasn't changed his behavior towards me)</p></li>
<li><p>Flat out saying I'm not looking for advice and just want him to listen when he tries to give it, but that causes him to withdraw from the conversation completely</p></li>
<li><p>I have tried repeatedly to make my desire for him to listen instead of problem solve explicitly at the beginning of the conversation, and he flat out refuses. I also have tried telling him the problem solving is making me feel worse, and that listening is what I need to feel better. He thinks it's absurd.</p></li>
<li><p>Quickly dismissing the ""solution"" so we don't get fixated on that instead, but he doesn't like being dismissed either</p></li>
<li><p>Keeping any problems to myself, but that causes a different sort of tension</p></li>
<li><p>Having a conversation where I try to understand why he's upset and also have him understand why I'm upset, but it quickly devolves into insults and snarky comments</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It's especially frustrating because I feel like the first method should work, especially because he acknowledges that he doesn't want advice either, and he prefers me responding the same way I'm asking him to respond. <strong>We want to be treated the same way!</strong> But when I ask him to return the favor, he responds with ""that's just how I am, if you give me a problem, I'll solve it"". I get it, we're both engineers, we're both wired to solve problems when we see them. It's extremely hard for me to bite my tongue and not try to help him! But I do it because it makes him happier, and I just want him to return the favor.  </p>

<p>How can I get my spouse to listen thoughtfully when I talk about a problem before summarily dismissing it with a ""solution""? <strong>I don't mind the advice itself, I mind the not letting me finish, not attempting to understand how I see the situation, and then not wanting to discuss the advice given.</strong></p>

How to avoid disappointing my friend when I criticize her writing?,"<p>Recently, a close friend of mine has started writing very short novels. From a conversation we had, I could clearly tell that she is very proud of the fruit of her labor and seriously considers writing professionally.</p>

<p>I accepted to provide feedback, which she has been eager to receive. I now regret this decision, for I find myself unable to formulate a single compliment about the first two samples she sent me. To be blunt: she hasn't proof-read herself and it shows.</p>

<p>Time pressure is piling up too, as she has sent me a third short and specifically asked for my opinion about the two previous writings, clearly expecting praise.</p>

<p>I can foresee that she would be deeply hurt by strongly negative critics, especially given how highly she regards her own work. Nonetheless, I want to remain as honest as possible.</p>

<p><strong>How can I give my friend the feedback she demands while not hurting her feelings nor being dishonest?</strong></p>
",24138,17-02-2020 00:23,How to tell my friend his novel's ending is too predictable but he should keep writing it?,"<p><strong>Context:</strong></p>

<p>I have been friends with a guy for 10 years who is a writer, and he is really good with sci-fi and fantasy themes. He has written a dozen of each so far, and each of them was really good, even if they didn't sell a lot because he is a self-publishing type guy and is not well versed in marketing and self-promotion.</p>

<p>He always asks for my advice before continuing his stories and has already stopped multiple ones, some at really advanced stages, just because I told him it was not as good as he would like it to be because he asked for my honest feedback. Every time I feel bad for this, but he kept telling me that perfect is better than done.</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>

<p>Recently, he decided that it was time to move out of his comfort zone and has decided to write a thriller, involving murder, and mystery.
He is really, <strong>really</strong> invested in his story and is really sensitive to any critique.</p>

<p>I read two-thirds of his new novel so far, and the story is really good, but I found the ending to be far too predictable. I asked him to tell me the ending without announcing my guess, just to be sure I had it right, and I got 100% of it.</p>

<p><strong>My question:</strong></p>

<p>I know—or strongly believe—he will abandon his story and throw it all out if I tell him his ending is really predictable and he should change it. He has spent hundreds of hours learning, reading, and researching to build his story and he has written more than 600 pages so far. I don't want him to throw it all out! His story is really good, but it lacks a twist at the end. While he can let go and move on easily over a story, I truly wish he would continue writing this one.</p>

<p>How can I make him understand it is not too late for him to change the ending because I genuinely enjoy his story?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>If it helps, I am a female, 22yo, and he is a male 36yo both living in France.</p>

<p>Basing my feedback on AHamilton's advice, I have tried to make him understand that he gives too many hints about the end throughout the story, and that I have guessed the ending.</p>

<p>I kept repeating to him that it was - in my opinion - one of the best book he wrote so far (this much is true).</p>

<p>I also told him that I was uneasy each time he has threw his work out solely on my opinion, and that I would like him to continue writing this one. He has given me apologies (that was unnecessary, but he is a cinnamon roll) and promises me to try his best to continue his stories till the end from now on.</p>

<p>I felt he was not totally satisfied with this conclusion, so I stayed with him during long hours so that we revised his story and remove/modify hints and a lot of chapters. It is far better now, and I am confident the ending is now unguessable:-D</p>

How to politely reject classmates that are constantly asking for my help?,"<p>I am in a situation where I am overwhelmed by school mates constantly asking for my help for their assignments and tests. (They have been doing this since grade 10!) And this has resulted in serious consequences on my health and school. I am constantly helping other people and left no time for the wellbeing of myself. Recently, my grades have worsened (relative to my usual grades) and my health has seriously deteriorated. </p>

<p>To tackle this, I want to shrink my ""help circle"" and helping my close friends only. Which means rejecting other people. And I want to do this as politely as possible, however, I am struggling to come up with appropriate responses. I define ""appropriate"" in terms of how ""unsatisfied"" they are. Most of them seem unhappy once I decline. </p>

<p>Some of my responses (more or less) are like:</p>

<p>""Look, I am very busy at the moment maybe go and talk to Greg. He can help.""</p>

<p>""Listen, I had a rather emotional day so I will appreciate enormously if you could leave me in peace.""</p>

<p>""Look Not Now, as you can tell I am very busy.""</p>

<p>I want to own my choices. I want to let them know that I am not obligated to help them in any way. I want to get appreciated. </p>

<p>My goal is to come up with a response where I can decline them without damaging the relationship between me and them as well as hinting to them that I do not want to help in the future. I want a response that doesn't project my ego too aggressively? (if that makes any sense)</p>

Now, I don't have much problem with helping them and I try my best to do that. <strong>However, you can't help everyone all the time.</strong></p>
<p>I learnt that the hard way in my mid-term exams because I didn't work enough on my weaknesses because most of my time was spent clearing any doubts(Solving the questions) my friends had. And those questions hardly ever overlapped with my weaknesses. Hence, my weaknesses remained exactly that.</p>
<p><strong>How do I refuse to provide help?</strong></p>
<p>Now, in my culture, it is sort of expected that if someone is good at, say, academics, they should help out the ones who are not so good at it. So, a direct no tends to harm relations with friends and also leads to you being seen as an arrogant jerk. I can tell them to come at a later time but they usually return at another time when I am even more busy and further excuses only serve to adversely affect relations. (<em>Note that: There is no severe deterioration. It is just that, it doesn't help with how people see you, and trust me, in my culture, how people see you, is very important</em>)</p>
<p>I have tried going to the library more often to counter this problem but the atmosphere in a library doesn't suit me and hence, even that is not an option.</p>

How can I break up with my girlfriend in the kindest way?,"<p>I have been with my girlfriend for 6 months and she moved in with me about 2 months ago. Outwardly to my friends and family she is very sweet and kind, but they only know the person she appears to be. I've talked to a couple very close friends and a sibling about the issues we have so they know how the relationship really is in private. A few of the issues with the relationship include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>She pressured me to move in when I thought it was too soon. I regret giving in to this.</p></li>
<li><p>She gets upset/mad very easily so I feel like I'm walking on egg shells.</p></li>
<li><p>She has disrespected me in ways I would never do to another person, let alone my significant other. This includes screaming at me at a busy street corner.</p></li>
<li><p>Asking to see my phone to see if another girl has texted me.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Initially, I wanted to fix the relationship, but I didn't get far. When I brought up her yelling at me on a street corner she cried and blamed me for not ""being patient enough"" with her. Then when I brought up how easily she gets mad at me she told me that ""I guess my ex was right that most guys can't handle me"". For reference, her ex is still trying to get back together with her.</p>

<p>I've decided I think it's best if we break up, but I've never broken up with someone before. Although I'm 26 and have been in a few relationships, all of my past girlfriends have either broken up with me or been amicable breakups. My parents absolutely love her and think she's the sweetest girl in the world because I've hidden our issues from them. This makes me think they will think I'm in the wrong for breaking up with her. I'm also concerned for her well-being post-breakup. She is an immigrant without many friends and is struggling at her job right now.</p>

<p>Another concern going through my head is how she will move out. She has a temper so I'm afraid she won't make it easy to separate our stuff and be civil about moving everything. I'm not too concerned about her stealing stuff from me intentionally, but I have a few things that hold a lot of sentimental value that I don't want to lose.</p>

<p>My girlfriend Alice and I have been together for the past 4 years, we're both 20 years old. I've recently decided to end our relationship for reasons related to some traits of her personality (e.g. anxious, lacking self-confidence, not quite lighthearted) and decreased physical attraction. But I can't do it right away because if I did, she would not be able to take her exams. Therefore I plan to tell her just a few days after them.</p>

<p>The thing is Alice suspects nothing at all. We have had contrasts but they've always been superficially temporary, as I try to be kind to her, even because she suffers from lack of self-esteem. In other words, she doesn't expect these problems are going to lead to a break-up. However, she irrationally fears it: despite me trying to push her to be more self-confident, she's always told me about being not enough for me, and that I shall leave her - even when I didn't want to. Relatedly, Alice has also often said that if I were to leave her, she wouldn't know how to live anymore, and even talked about suicide. I am pretty sure she won't do anything dangerous, but this is obviously not a healthy attitude from her - I've always tried to correct this, and even suggested to go to a doctor, but she always minimized, and after all <em>she has me</em>. I hope she'll have the courage to go after the break-up.</p>

<p>Also, Alice has an apartment way larger than mine, and we almost live together there. </p>

<p>Now, I still care for her, so I'm trying to find the best possible way. For example I definitely won't leave her alone before seeing her calm enough. Besides, I'll make sure her flatmate is at home when it happens, so that she can support Alice after I go, and anyway prevent her from hurting herself. </p>

<p>I will avoid telling her about what might be wrong with her, and focus on the fact that <em>I have changed</em>, and I need to recollect myself because my feelings for her are not as intense as before.</p>

<p><strong>Here's my question:</strong></p>

<p>If I were to prepare Alice through a longer period of time, how should I do it? It seems to me that stopping going to her apartment and remaining in a sort of limbo for days is in its own right, by contrast, something so big that might even worsen or elongate her suffering over all.</p>

<p>Also, I want to tell Alice that if she'll be willing, I will do whatever is in my power to help her get over this moment, and even stay friends with her when she does, if she wants to. How can I do so without running the risk of actually making it harder for her to go forward?</p>

He always makes some kind of excuse why he needs to call me, for example he will say ""I need you to call me. It's important."" or ""I have a question to ask you. Can you call me?"" Then even if I tell him if he can just text me or if it can wait, he will call me anyways. Doesn't even matter what I'm doing. I could be at work, or out in town, or doing chores, and I'd have to drop everything. And these conversations will go on forever, to the point of wasting my time because there talking about stuff I really don't care about or he talked about it already.</p>

<p>I've tried a few things. Ignoring him turns into a nightmare. He will begin spam calling and texting me till I pick up. I'll wake up after a nap or coming back from outside, only to find tons of messages and voicemails with a slow progression of him getting pissed off because I didn't answer his calls. And the direct approach only gets similar results with the same excuse: ""I have a right to call my friends!"" I can understand like once a week, but 3 or more times a day... that's excessive...</p>

<p>It's putting a strain on our friendship and I can't stand doing this everyday. I'm desperate for some way to fix this without ending what would be a perfectly fine friendship otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>Answering some questions:</strong></p>

<p><em>Is there a chance of mental illness?</em></p>

<p>If you consider being short fused a mental illness. Otherwise, I'm sure if that was the case, I would have picked up on it. </p>

<p><em>Is there something in it for me?</em></p>

<p>No. I'm not a person who would use someone else for any reason and neither has he. Matter of fact, we hate depending on others. (Unless I have misunderstood what you mean.) </p>

<p><em>Is this a possible relationship issue?</em></p>

<p>I'm only clarifying this because I saw it brought up. I'm a dude, Hes a dude.  There's nothing between us other then a long-term friendship. I'm not even going to bring sexuality into the mix ether.</p>

<p><em>What is he calling about?</em></p>

<p>When he talks about ""urgency"" he usually dose have a problem, but its usually only <em>minor</em> problem, like something I usually cant help him with and sometimes I'm sure he could care for on his own. But from what I've caught onto, its usually only something he can get my attention for so he can go ""Well, since I have you on the phone..."" And then he starts talking to me about random things that just have no connection to his original problem and are simply not important.</p>
",18257,06-09-2018 03:14,How can I get a friend to stop calling me all of the time?,"<p>My friend has been there for me through the worst times of my life, and to the point where no one really helped me besides her. She's going through a bit of a rough time now and I've done everything I can to help her. I normally do answer her calls and I can sit on the phone with her for literally <em>hours</em> while only she rants about her problems. But I started grad school and I just can't do it anymore. </p>

<p>She will call me 8-10 times a day. And before I used to answer every time but I genuinely can't now. So when she calls I don't pick up and I politely text her that I'm busy right now and I'll call her when I get a chance. She says okay but then continues to call me profusely. She calls me while I'm in class, even though I tell her every night that I'm in class. She apologizes afterwards but I can't handle this anymore. </p>

<p>She is way too dependent on me and I'm honestly just tired of hearing her problems 24/7. I used to do it but it's been 7 months of the same stuff, and I honestly don't empathize with her. She's suffocating me and I feel like I'm going to explode. I can meet her, spend the whole day with her, and after going home, she will still call me. I used to deal with this but I'm so frustrated now and I don't know how to handle this situation. </p>

<p>She's so so sensitive and I know that if I spoke to her about this, she would absolutely lose her mind (even if I did it in the gentlest way possible). My plan so far is just to keep ignoring her calls and text her saying I'm busy, maybe she'll get the hint after a while (although she hasn't already). And I also feel a little guilt because she was there for me when I needed someone and I needed help in a way I never thought someone would do, so I feel like if I don't answer her all the time, that I'm using her. </p>

<p>How can I handle this situation?</p>

<hr>

<p>Some questions answered:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Does she have a job or not?</em> </li>
</ul>

<p>She's not unemployed. She recently found a job after she graduated college last year. However, right after graduation she was hired but then fired because the boss believed she was unintelligent and made too many mistakes. She recently found another job where the boss is making the same criticisms of her and she is getting paid peanuts. She is very upset by this and has been looking for jobs but she never gets any call backs.   </p>

<ul>
<li><em>Does she live with her family?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>She lives with her family. She constantly complains about them as well because they don't support her emotionally but in my opinion every does try to support her emotionally but she just takes it too far and requires too much at a certain point. </p>

<ul>
<li><em>How old am I? How old is she? How long have we been friends and what do we both do?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I just turned 21, I currently have a job as a software engineer and I am in grad school working towards my PhD in pure math. She is 24, has a degree in psychology and is working in a law firm as some kind of administrative assistant. We've been friends for 3 years but only became close over the past year. </p>

<ul>
<li><em>Has her mood shifted, was she cheerful before? What triggered this?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>She was cheerful but this past year is when we got really close. She wouldn't have opened up to me this much last year. What triggered this was some friendships ended in her life. She took it so badly. These girls who were her friends gave her advice on how to potentially find a guy because all she complains about is how ugly she is and how much guys don't want to be with her, and she was offended and then they stopped talking to her and she hasn't gotten over it since. </p>

<ul>
<li><em>Do you think she is depressed?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I do think she is depressed, I suggested seeing a therapist (as I do) and recommended her to my center. She started going but she complains about the therapist not seeing eye to eye with her there as well. 
I have spoken about this with my therapist but he hasn't advised me of anything yet, maybe I will ask him next session. I don't think she is a threat to herself at all but she will just get even more depressed.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>How does the stuff she's done for me compare to the stuff I've done for her?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I don't know how to compare but I think they are about the same level but I just feel so indebted to her because I never had someone care so much to help me that much from late night outings to holding me while crying. Granted, I've done the same for her but I still feel bad.</p>

<p>Also, there are no romantic feelings involved at all. We are both straight women.</p>

How do I inform my neighbor about not cutting grass on my side of the lawn?,"<p>I know it's not a big deal for most, but I really do put a lot of effort into having a nice lawn, and our next door neighbour has done a few things that grind my gears, and I do not know how to resolve without creating a grumpy neighbour.</p>

<p>He replaced his front lawn with an extended driveway, while our side is a lawn.</p>

<p>As soon as we moved in, he cut a foot strip off our lawn, and replaced with new sod, so it looks like a nice edge to his property while ours looked mediocre.</p>

<p>Instead of worrying, we simply redid our entire front lawn with new sod to match.</p>

<p>The city-side curb grass we keep nice and thick (3"" or so) while he cuts his bare. The issue is that recently he started cutting a full lawnmower width into our side.</p>

<p>I cut the grass twice a week, it's very maintained and definitely the better looking of the two, while he does it once a month, then damages some of our side, even if I just cut 30 minutes ago, he will go over what I just cut and take a strip and turn it yellow and bare.</p>

<p><strong>How do I approach him without causing a heated neighbor situation?</strong></p>
",17423,07-08-2018 22:17,Uncomfortable With Neighbor Mowing Our Lawn,"<p>A couple of days ago we looked out our window and saw that our next-door neighbor was mowing our lawn. We have noticed her lack of interpersonal boundaries on several occasions since we moved in a couple of years ago, but it hasn't outweighed the positives of being neighbors – until now. Anyway, my husband went outside and asked her what she was doing, and her reply was a mixture of concern about leaves blowing onto her lawn and wanting to do us a favor because we are such helpful and good neighbors to her.</p>
<p>There were leaves in one distinct area of our front lawn close to her house, and we were on our way out to run some errands, so we shortsightedly shrugged it off and went on with our day. While we were gone she proceeded to mow our entire front lawn and the public right-of-way that extends around our property (we live on a corner lot), and she mowed it much shorter<sup>(*)</sup> than we customarily mow it.</p>
<p>Since the lawn care in our household is my domain more so than my husband's, I am volunteering to have “the talk” with her. The issues as I see them are as follows. She came onto our property and started altering it without our prior knowledge or permission and she preempted our agency and willingness to remedy something that she found problematic. She then corrected the problem far beyond the scope of what she had indicated to my husband and did it to her own aesthetic preferences rather than ours. There is another issue worth considering: the possibility of her injuring herself while on our property and our liability in that event. <a href=""https://injury.findlaw.com/accident-injury-law/premises-liability-who-is-responsible.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://injury.findlaw.com/accident-injury-law/premises-liability-who-is-responsible.html</a></p>
<p>People with poor boundaries often don't take hints easily, so I want to be direct but not unnecessarily harsh. I'm looking for suggestions to prepare myself so that I can say what I need to say, and suggestions on how to handle what I imagine will be defensive or deflective responses on her part. I think one opening she might use is the fact that my husband didn’t explicitly tell her <em>not</em> to do it, and she would have naturally assumed that he was speaking for both of us.</p>
<hr />
<p><sup>(*) We mow our lawn to about three inches, and mow it once a week during the growing season, so it is never anywhere near nuisance height. I had last mowed it in mid-November, and although we have had an unusually mild fall, it has not grown appreciably since then.</sup></p>

Disproving false beliefs of an acquaintance which may be dangerous or affect our relationships,"<p>There is a similar question here: <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/q/7905/6751"">How to tell someone believing in pseudoscience &amp; conspiracy theories is wrong without making them feel stupid/upset?</a> My question has a different setting: I'm dealing with a person who is not my friend or family member.</p>

<p><strong>Situation</strong>: I was talking to a guy (an acquaintance who I have some common business with, not related to job) about sex-related topics and I asked him if he knows that syphilis can be transferred via kisses, and he responded with a bunch of nonsense. He believes that ""syphilis is a gene of the negroid race which helps to deal with high temperatures and that if a woman is infected, she will have a specific scent."" (My rough paraphrase of his words.) That is obviously all false.</p>

<p>The problem is, he seems to have rather chaotic sexual habits, and I believe he might end up having some STD. He mistakingly believes that he can tell if someone is infected and take some actions to prevent the infection.</p>

<p><strong>My goal</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>At the minimum, I want to tell him he's wrong, but I can't (and don't want to) spend too much time on it.</li>
<li>Ideally, I'd like to teach him something about reputable sources of information and how to spot urban legends, pseudoscience, etc., but I don't want to give him a lecture.</li>
<li>I already told him what I know about the disease, but he replied with, ""I'll find the info later [and show you]."" He seems like a stubborn guy, and I hope there's a method to present the information vividly, in a way which he wouldn't want to argue with.</li>
<li>I don't want to be rude, but I'm not really afraid of upsetting him. Our relationships are somewhere between ""colleagues"" and ""bros,"" so he's okay with informal conversations.</li>
</ul>

<p>That is not the first time I hear this kind of bizarre ""facts"" from him, and since we'll probably communicate for a while, I'd like to do something about it, partly because I care about him a bit, and partly because some of his ""myths"" affect the way we do our common business.</p>
",17124,30-07-2018 23:12,How to tell someone believing in pseudoscience & conspiracy theories is wrong without making them feel stupid/upset?,"<p>A close family member of mine is a raw vegan, anti vaxer, anti-antibiotics, anti-fluoride, believes in chemtrails, has a machine that filters water and makes it alkaline, eats lots of supplements, buys only organic produce and buys all her hygiene, beauty and cleaning products at the holistic store. </p>

<p>Overall, her health isn't great, and whenever she gets ill she blames it on something she ate or the chemicals in the air... </p>

<p>In my opinion, she is not nourishing her body properly, and I'm worried that piggybacking all the supplements and miracle treatments is not only ineffective but detrimental to her health. It also worries me she would only go to the doctor as her last resort, and even when she gets a prescription, she wouldn't always take the meds. She says she prefers to fight the illness naturally and have a stronger immune system as a result :( </p>

<p>If I say something she believes in is wrong, she gets upset. So I try to logic her out of her beliefs, but she would rather tell me I have a very linear and mathsy way of thinking (since I am a physicist), therefore I can't possibly understand her ""facts"". This makes me so sad as she would trust me with physics, yet somehow in an argument about biology, chemistry, ""toxins"", and vaccines my use of pure logic and critical thinking goes over her head. </p>

<p>On the other hand, she has read books on those topics which are popular science at best and complete garbage at worse. None of those come close to even high school textbook standard - she might as well be reading tabloid articles in book format. Sadly, she feels her arguments are more valid since she has read books with things like  ""adjuvant"",  ""metabolism"" and ""blood-brain barrier"" written in them. That's enough for her to deem them reputable sources of the truth behind such and such.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder... If I had the time and the willpower to read all she has read on this: would she then listen to me? Or would she keep arguing?</p>

<p>Anyway, this person is important to me and I hate our constant arguments. I hate that I hide my chocolate &amp; pretend to be vegan in front of her to avoid upsetting her. I wish we could just enjoy some lunch out in town without hearing things like ""that sandwich must have been packed with sugar and gluten because I feel so bad now"" for a week afterward, even though her test for gluten sensitivity came out negative. And most important of all I want to make sure she isn't unwittingly ruining her health.</p>

<p>How can I convince someone believing in pseudoscience &amp; conspiracy theories to change their views and trust conventional medicine without making them feel stupid or upset?</p>

How to greet someone in a long corridor,"<p>Sometimes, as I am walking, for example, in a long corridor, I will randomly make eye contact from across the corridor with someone I know personally who is walking in the opposite direction. I want to greet this person but I am always unsure on how to do it. It's always a bit awkward because of the initial distance which prevents vocal greetings, but waving from afar and then slowly walking towards each other followed by another greeting is also kinda weird.</p>

<p>So my question is :</p>

<p><strong>What is the best way to behave when you see someone you want to greet but they are far away?</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes I just wait to be close enough to greet vocally but the long walk without acknowledging each other is still weird.</p>

I have to take my dog out for walks, or sometimes I just go for walks alone, and usually the street is a pretty desolate place. However, on occasion, I do come across other walkers. Since this road is more or less very straight for a long ways, I am often put into an awkward situation where the walker and I notice each other and neither of us know what to do. The other person looks at me for a second, and I look at them, and then we look away and pretend not to notice each other for two minutes until we pass each other, where we suddenly look up and wave to each other and then continue on our way. It is very obvious that we both were very unsure of what to do.</p>

<p>So how do I act to make these encounters a bit less uncomfortable? Wave from the moment we make eye contact? Ignore them altogether as if I'm blind? I've come across this situation countless times and I'm still baffled about what to do.</p>

How to get to know a service staff without interrupting her work?,"<p>On friday night I was out with some friends of mine, we often go to a hookah lounge (which are quite common here in germany, I don't really know about other countries - basically you can smoke hookahs, have some drinks and enjoy your company with your friends).</p>

<p>There was this new service staff, which seems to be new since I've never seen her before. To me, she was stunning. Still can't get her out of my head. So my goal definitly is to get to know her. The question is, how do I do this, without interrupting her work?</p>

<p>This lounge, as the name suggests, isn't really oriented like a bar or something similar. Basically there are many couches where you can sit with your friends. There is like a counter, where you can order drinks but usually the staff just comes right up to you if the notice your empty glasses. Also, in most cases, it's not possibly to stand at the counter without annoying other customers, because there are couches in front of that counter too.</p>

<p>As I said, I dont want to get in the way of her serving other customers. I don't want her to get in trouble with her boss.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Edit (forgot to include that information):</p>

<p>Atleast I already know her name. A friend of the friends I was with there knows this girl quite well. But I've never seen him or the girl ever before, so I can't just go ask him or something :/</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
I know some people are asking: ""does this even matter?"" and to answer this, maybe it doesn't, however, I think in social settings it is nice to know what a person's gender is. It helps you to judge how to appropriately talk to them and interact with them.</p>

To solve this, it'd be easier just to ask someone what they'd like to be called, but in most cultures (Mine in the US included), it's rude to ask someone what their gender is. I've gotten responses from (not the people I'd like to ask) from horror to ""He's Crazy!"". I've also gotten negative responses from askees as well, and I want to try to avoid this in the future.</p>

<p>This wouldn't usually be an issue when trying to talk to them, just wording phrases to use ""them"" is a pretty easy work around. It's an issue when I need their preferred gender for filling out forms for them and such. </p>

<ul>
<li>I don't have any GF/relation and they come up with even worse things like suggesting Ms. XYZ as ""<em>Hey, What about her?</em>"" (completed with a wink) and they ""move on"" after ruining my whole day?</li>

<li>I live in Pakistan where such a jokes/teasing about the wedding are common (but I don't like them one bit) but because of that, I don't want to be harsh on anyone.</li>
<li>I saw answers to the related question but I can't make excuses like ""I have already talked to my GF"", or ""I am too young"" (at the wrong end of 20's which is not young at all for a marriage here), etc.</li>
<li>The toughest part is my politeness being mistaken as ""he is also enjoying it with us - see he is about to blush"" while from inside I wonder on them for wasting time on a repeated useless question (once I got married, you all will know. No?)</li>

Everything was O.K.: project, team, team-leader etc. But our TL (team leader) got a better offer from another company and of course, he accepted it. For few weeks we had no TL, but we managed somehow to keep working at the project, everything was cool and I'm quite sure we could keep it that way.</p>

<p>But, as every team needs a TL, we have been assigned one (he is the leader of 2 teams now) and he and his first team decided to have a team-building trip for 2 days somewhere close to a mountain. Of course, now that we are his team, he invited us to join. It was very nice of him and all my coworkers accepted to join.</p>

<p>I don't have something else planned for that weekend, it's organized by company so expenses would be from my behalf very low, it's not that I don't like my colleagues, I do, but I don't want to go for a few reasons.</p>

<p>Since the other team will be there and they are about 30 people (compared to us, 6) I won't feel good. I don't want to meet new people, or make new friends. I'm comfortable with my friends and my colleagues (to whom I get along quite well). Also, there will be drinking, drunk people, smoking and loud music (things that I can't stand).</p>

<p>The thing is that I've avoided until now a few team-building trips or hang outs and had reasons (except the ones above). I also did it this time (and want to do it further) but now... there was quite a wonder for the TL and team, so they started with questions. My final answer was that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have things to do and I wouldn't give up on them since it will be harder for me to do it later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They were surprised of my decision (probably of my reason too), especially the TL.</p>

<p>Now, my question is: <strong>how do I avoid going with them in team-building trips or hang outs without causing bad feelings for my coworkers</strong>?</p>

<p>I wouldn't like to be tagged as the ""asocial-guy"" or make them think ""He doesn't want to hang out with us"". I want to make them understand that it's not that I do not like them or something like that. It is O.K, and even a pleasure for me to work with them or to chat when we're in break, but I just don't want to go in team-building.</p>

<p>So, how to I avoid the team building trips, but assure my colleagues it's nothing personal? I would like them to accept me as a ""don't want to come"" person, but without having bad feelings towards me (if that's even possible).</p>

<p>How can I politely decline such requests? How can I gauge what the person wants if there not very technical and might not understand what they are talking about? How can I make it clear I may have to abandon the project at any point? </p>

<p>I'm volunteering with another group and offered to update their website. This seems to have been a misunderstanding because to them update means add totally new features when I meant simply update text and pictures. They have trouble understanding sometimes complex CSS is required to get overlapping pictures that can resize to any screen etc.</p>

<p>All these people I care a lot about and don't want to go back on my word/offer.</p>
",14421,13-05-2018 16:54,How do I tell certain customers they're not my number one priority?,"<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I work for a very small company that's been around a long time, we do a mix of processing customer products and consultancy work. We have a reasonable mix of customers, working for multiple departments of some of the larger ones.</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>It's a feast or famine industry and some of our customers need us purely because of their lack of organisation. This means that for some customers their capacity requirements vary weekly and unpredictably. Sometimes it's really quiet and we're having to search for work, sometimes we're super busy and we get a lot of projects come in at same time (usually around the time someone's on holiday!) and obviously some customers have to wait while we work on other customers projects/products.</p>

<p>99% of the time we have a very quick turnaround time (1-2 days) though very occasionally it's more like 3-4 days. That's still normally quicker than the quote or purchase order states so it's not late, just not as quick as normal.</p>

<p>No one likes to hear (and I don't like saying) they're not the number one priority. So what is a good way to tell a customer that we're working on another project and we'll work on theirs [insert time frame here]?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm not asking about how to manage projects/resources, just how to explain to customers we are low on capacity.</p>

How to ask someone not to use a voice that irritates me?,"<p>I work with a lady who sometimes uses an extremely irritating voice. She is very friendly, and I enjoy talking to her, but when she uses this certain voice I just want to pull my hair out. I try to get busy with something else but this seems to confuse her and she persists. The voice is high pitched and whiny. I think she thinks she’s being cute or playful when she uses it.</p>

<p>How can I point this out and ask her to stop without offending her? I would like to be subtle but all I can think of is ‘can you please not use that voice you’re talking with right now?’</p>
",12438,28-03-2018 08:16,How can I tell someone I don't like the way they speak?,"<p>I can't stand ""cutesy voice"". That is, people who put on a high pitched squeal when they talk, who choose to say things like ""wuv"" over ""love"" or say things that are dark in a cute way. It's made worse if these people act as though <em>they always speak this way</em> when they don't, or they affect the mannerisms of an anime or something. Generally I just tolerate it because I choose not to be in the company of someone who's willing to infantalize themselves just because, but I always think of those people as dumb, even if they aren't. I am a generally easy-going, relaxed person. I do not get physical often, and I communicate my feelings when I feel comfortable doing so. (For context, I grew up in a place where physical violence is a common although looked down upon occurrence. I'm also a small female, and I am stressing that I didn't want to get physical because I'm accustomed to things like this becoming quite physical for no reason.)</p>

<p>The other day I was out with a friend of mine who is an artist, helping set up/sell her items. She was set up next to a woman who wasn't selling as much. This woman was talking, constantly, in ""cutesy voice"". And I know that this is not ""just the way she speaks"" because she didn't always speak that way, she just lapsed in and out of it. She put on the voice with customers, or when she was asking for unreasonable favors and almost always followed up with a high pitched laugh that was also being faked. Sometimes she would have a full on conversation in her normal voice and then go ""Oops! Teeheehee! I'm so silly-willy!"" and switch to cutesy voice. It didn't seem like she was doing it because she was being forced to, and it did seem like she had to remind herself to do it.</p>

<p>I asked her at the time if she could stop doing it. I don't remember the exact phrasing, but it was along the lines of, ""Do you mind not talking to me like that, please?"" She responded by agreeing to stop, and then she would maybe go one line without the voice. Then she would go, ""Oops!"" And go back to cutesy voice. I also ignored her, but the set up of the event means that artists get called away a lot. We do have to talk to each other (""can you watch my table,"" ""can you get lunch for me"" ""I'm going to the bathroom"" etc.""). My friend is called away fairly often because she does a lot of work with the organizers. So often, I'm at the table alone. I like working at this event, so I want to resolve this without leaving the event completely.</p>

<p>I'm not bothered by her talking to her customers this way but she will often ""forget"" I asked her to not use cutsey voice to me after talking with a customer. I sort of can forgive that, except that yesterday she barely sold anything. She would still go back to cutesy voice even though there was no reason to ""reset"" back to it.</p>

<p>I just dealt with it by ignoring her or only answering questions that weren't in cutesy voice, but at the end of the day I had a physical hatred towards this woman.</p>

<p>My hatred of cutesy voice <em>does not mean</em> that I don't want people to use it. I mean I don't, obviously, but they don't <em>have</em> to care about my opinion. However I would like to not reach a point where I hate someone because they use that voice, I feel like that's a bit unfair. I do want to somehow tell them to cut it out when they're talking to me. It's awkward and patronizing and traps me in a conversation I don't want to have. I'm not sure if I can politely say to someone like this to not address me that way without being rude. I have no idea how to breach this topic with people who talk to me like that.</p>

<p>There is a <em>very</em> high chance that my friend will need help and I have to talk to this particular woman again and I just want to be able to tell her to stop doing it so that I don't spend the rest of my day hating someone who isn't doing anything but getting on my nerves and tapping into my pet peeve. <strong>How can I tell someone not to talk to me using a voice they're putting on that annoys me?</strong></p>

<p>I accidentally edited this out but: when my friend was at the table and was talking with this woman, I often had to walk away. Also, there were times when she made unreasonable requests, like that we buy her lunch or that we just leave the table-- she would always request this in cutesy voice.</p>

Whether to Initiate Contact With Barista,"<p>I frequent a particular coffee shop 3-4 times a week, and am pretty familiar with the baristas, as I see them often. I've noticed one of them, C, is flirty and playful with me, and seems genuinely happy to see me when I come in. I'm interested in getting to know her better, but so far our interactions have been limited to brief conversations over the register. I've tried to occasionally steer conversation away from work, but she's busy and on the clock, and I don't want to be the asshole holding up the line. Knowing that what little relationship we have so far is business/customer related, </p>

How to create a more engaging online conversation with a friend?,"<p>I have a friend I talk with <em>online</em> and the conversations we are having are rather short. I would like to have more engaging conversations without forcing myself and the other person in a conversation we don't want.</p>
<p>Here an example of how the conversation is usually going, this happens when I start the conversation or when the other person starts the conversation. The conversation example is quite generic and the subject is always a little bit different.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other: Hey, how are you doing?</p>
<p>Me(5 min to 1 hour later): hey, I'm doing okay, little bit busy with school. How are you doing?</p>
<p>Other(1 hour to 2 hours later): &quot;something small about the day only responding about what I said, in this case busy with school&quot;.</p>
<p>Me(5 min to 30 min later): &quot;responds talks about something small about the day&quot;</p>
<p>Other(1 hour to 3 hours later): &quot;short response&quot; &amp; I'm going to sleep, cya</p>
<p>Me(5 min to 30 min later): Okay good night</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the example shows, I response quite fast since I have my chat app open at all times, which means I see messages almost always immediately. The other person always takes more than an hour to respond.</p>
<p>For me this is quite though since I don't know how to respond. This also makes me quite unsure if this person wants to talk, however I think this person wants to talk since I'm not the only one who starts a conversation. I tried different things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only asking about how their day was</li>
<li>Saying something about my day (as the example, also in my first response)</li>
<li>Responding to questions and not starting a new subject(to give the other person space to talk)</li>
<li>Take more time to respond to messages, so I give more space</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>How to start a more engaging, online conversation with a person who gives short responses and takes a longer to react to messages?</p>
<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Starting more engaging, online conversations with this person.</li>
<li>Give the other room to talk about what they want to talk about.</li>
<li>Not being clingy/codependent (I don't want this to be the focus of the question) however the distance should stay appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<p>When talking with people, especially people at my own age (~18), I would often get tired of the conversation unless it was about a topic which is either relevant to me or a problem, in which case I am always eager to find a solution or some way I can stay content with the issue. </p>

<p>Because I seem to be in this constant pursuit of solutions and final answers I often feel like I am cutting people off by driving the conversation to an end too quickly. I tend to listen to a person talking at the beginning of a conversation (which they usually start), then I make out the issue or ""problem"" and then I seem to invalidate or shut down anything else the person could have said by either saying ""Well, that´s just how it is"" or ""I think you have got it wrong, you should think of it this way"" and then I defend my opinion and prove them wrong which of course is not what most people are looking for when starting a casual conversation.</p>

<p>Are there any techniques that I can practice to keep a conversation going while still expressing my thought on the matter? It is not that I do not want to talk about things but I seem to fail to involve other people into my thoughts and I also find it difficult to involve myself with the issues of others.</p>

Politeness vs. conciseness in writing emails,"<p>I often find myself starting sentences with phrases like ""I just want to let you know that"", ""I would like to ask if"", ""I am writing to discuss"", or ""I was wondering if"" in emails. I could simply just let them know something or ask what I wanted to ask without these phrases.</p>

<p>For some reasons, it feels more polite to not directly say what I want to say.</p>

<p>Is there a merit to the politeness argument?</p>

<p>I originally asked this on english.stackexchange, but I was told that interpersonal.stackexchange is a better forum for this question.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I think the original question was not clear, so here is what I am asking:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it true that starting sentences with such leading phrases makes the email sound more polite?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be more clear, I live and work in the U.S., but grew up in a different country. I cannot tell if my reluctance to write direct sentences comes from my cultural background, or it is actually more polite in the U.S. to use these phrase.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I regularly have to edit in these sorts of &quot;pleasantries&quot; or &quot;greetings&quot; or &quot;niceties&quot; at the beginning and end of emails right before I hit send because I <em>always</em> forget them but don't want to sound like I don't care about the person I'm communicating with. I find this is generally more common in emails after a break in communication. The example above is a bit extreme but I often find myself wanting to add something more than simply the name of the person I'm addressing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Happy Monday, hope you had a great weekend!</li>
<li>Good morning!</li>
<li>Welcome back from your vacation! When you've had time to catch up . . .</li>
<li>Thanks for your help!</li>

<p>Yesterday I had a chat with someone and they told me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In email and other forms of digital communication it's becoming increasingly rude to include such niceties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know that email has become a pretty laid-back form of communication but is it now so laid back that I should cut to the chase, get to the point, kill the kindness?</p>
<p>Is there any evidence in the form of a sourced article that these niceties are going the way of the dodo?</p>
<hr />
<p>I don't want anecdotal evidence for this. Everyone has their own writing style and preference. I want a study that supports either using or not using them. I've found email writing guides that make statements one way or another:</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.brazen.com/blog/archive/career-growth/10-tips-for-writing-effective-emails-that-will-help-you-get-what-you-want/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Brazen.com</a> 2014</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You wouldn’t walk into a friend’s house for dinner and bark out a command. The same is true for email. Niceties can go a long way.</p>
<p>Pleasantries aren’t dated constructs; they’re valuable warm-up phrases for effective communication. Start your messages warmly, comment on your recipients’ latest achievements and wish them well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hope all is well in your corner of the world! If Facebook’s telling me the scoop, it looks like you had an eventful month…</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>But <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/email-etiquette-when-being-impolite-at-work-pays"" rel=""noreferrer"">this article</a> by  The Daily Beast in 2011 disagrees:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Niceties, Shmiceties: How E-mail Etiquette Could Be Holding You Back</p>
<p>I started with email, where I had often signed off with a chipper “thanks!” or apologized for inconveniencing someone with a request or for taking a while to reply. I was no longer sorry it took so long to get back to anyone. Neither did I feel either regretful about asking them to do something or grateful to them in advance for doing it.</p>
<p>I painstakingly reread every message to make sure neither polite phrase had sneaked through. And after I’d carefully excised each self-effacing slip, I hit send with a new set to my jaw, a hard glimmer in my eyes.</p>
<p>The effect was immediate: Colleagues began to treat me with more respect. Celebrity publicists—a notably power-aware lot whom I often contacted in my job—were more responsive. Even interns (those pecking-order experts) seemed to regard me with a new sort of awe.</p>

<p>Though, this article is one person's experience rather than a broader study and it's also specific to women.</p>

How to avoid short answers when talking to my family?,"<p>I am a 30 year old programmer, and I feel like becoming more and more a &quot;program&quot; myself.</p>
<p>When talking with friends or families, except for a certain group of friends with whom it's always fun and games, I don't ask much and I don't tell much.</p>
<p>So, when I'm being asked things, I just use short answers and if they want to know more, they have to ask more, like in the example here</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Person: Did you see the soccer game yesterday?</p>
<p>Me: Um, nope</p>
<p>Person: Why? What were you doing?</p>
<p>Me: Playing games, as usual</p>
<p>Person: What games?</p>
<p>Me: Game 1, game 2 and game 3</p>
<p>Person: Yes, as usual indeed...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, the main problem here is, I don't know when I began to act like this, but I just don't tell anything unless being precisely asked to, like an SQL query, and that behavior makes me more and more socially awkward, and annoying for my family as well.</p>
<p>When it is questions about my job, it is like in <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/3213/how-to-deal-politely-with-people-asking-about-your-job-but-unable-to-understand"">this question</a>, but what is worse, my job is just boring lines of code and I have nothing exciting to tell them.</p>
<p>How can I revert back to a more social behavior?</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> - I am mostly asked questions by my aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews and nieces as my parents already know how annoying it is to try to start a conversation with me, as our talks lead to absolutely nowhere</p>
<p><strong>Edit from comments and answers</strong> - My bad, my soccer game example is not a very good one as I enjoy soccer (like I would have prefered if they told me their highlights of the game instead of asking me what I was doing instead), but I just have my video games at a higher priority in my hobbies - plus, I didn't switch on my TV for a long time (over 10 years?)</p>
<p><strong>Edit for more clarification</strong> - No one asked for this (hey, I can do it when I'm writing) but as a context, most of them tend to investigate on my private life as I am now the only single person among my cousins (and still am) - In case you wanna know, my everyday life is waking up, preparing for work, going to work, at work, picking up my mother when she finishes work, going home, having dinner (sometimes asked questions during dinner), spending about ten minutes on social medias to know if my pals are preparing some weekend plans, playing games, and go to sleep... And if my friends have some plans, either my parents don't need me at home and I'm able to attend the plan, or I stay at home, hanging out with my parents and playing games</p>
<p><strong>Another note</strong> - I live in a developing country, I am part of an association who wants to promote esports in the country, and I am a leader of a certain community who plays a certain game that I enjoy playing at</p>

How to politely end old friendships?,"<p><strong>Context:</strong></p>

<p>I've recently come to the conclusion that I would like to end several old friendships. I keep making up excuses why I don't have time to see them, when I don't want to see them, and also don't have time.</p>

<p>These are mostly friends that know each other or at least used to know each other.</p>

<p>I believe that I've valued friendships as something inherently valuable and for old friendships they've become a sort of investment. This is until I realize that although it may be amusing to reminisce over nostalgic memories at times, there is no way this can in any way possibly justify the amount of time I keep putting in.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>My goal is to stop having to deal with friends, but at the same time leave things in a note that attempts to leave no hard feelings.</p>
",10589,17-02-2018 01:01,How can I best let my once-close friend know that I think our friendship is over--if at all?,"<p>My once-closest friend and I have seriously drifted apart. It's come as far as that I do not want to invest any more energy in the friendship and I'd prefer it to just quietly end.</p>

<p>I am unsure, however, whether to tell him (live, or by e-mail) that I consider our friendship done. A complicating factor is that we are both part of an extended social circle centered around our bridge club, with many mutual friends. I do not expect him to retreat from that circle anytime soon, nor am I planning to.</p>

<p>A bit of background may be in order. We have been friends since college, and over the last few years have mainly bonded over board games and bridge. We are both around 40, and are both male.</p>

<p>I'll try to name a few reasons I want to end this, but I'll try and stay short:</p>

<ul>
<li>He complains a lot, always about the same things--mainly work and other people in his life. He takes advice about the issues, doesn't follow any of it and then complains again next time we meet. Rinse and repeat.</li>
<li>He has incredibly high expectations of people he interacts with in matters of communication, how they should behave and what they should do for him. And doesn't live up to them in return himself.</li>
<li>Connecting to previous: if I, in his eyes, failed his expectations, we have to <em>talk about it for a bit</em> and then he puts me on the defensive about what his slights are or, even, as he puts it, 'the standard of people you interact with'.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lately, we have had very little interaction. After I had to find out about his girlfriend's pregnancy through her social media rather than him telling me, I decided not to put any effort in this anymore. A few weeks ago, he (too late, imho) proposed to have dinner together again, with his partner and mine. I avoided that proposal and have not had contact since.</p>

<p>If I prefer this to die a quiet death, is it better I end things with him by an email or a talk? Or is it better to just stay quiet and hope that he takes the cues? I'd prefer to keep a respectful distance while still interact every now and then, because we are in the same club.</p>

<p><em>tl;dr</em>: My old friend has worn out my patience, partially by not initiating much contact. We are going to be seeing each other in social situations, but I want our friendship to be over, preferably quietly. Is it best to 'officially' end things with an email or a talk, or not?</p>

He couldn't pay himself as he needed a credit card for the payment, but he promised to return by cash when he arrives. Now he's in our city, we're meeting with him every day, soon he'll leave, but I am afraid he completely forgot about his debt because he's very absent minded.</p>

<p>To put some more context into my question: his financial situation is good enough to pay the debt, he almost never borrows money, we're very good friends and I am a self-financing student who actually needs that money. The problem is that I am a very shy person when it comes to money, especially with my friends. So, how can I politely, better implicitly, remind my friend to return his debt?</p>

<p>Side note: I am aware of <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/2536/how-to-ask-a-friend-to-repay-me""><em>""How to ask a friend to repay me?""</em> question</a>, but the attitudes of borrowers in the questions are completely different.</p>

How do I get people to speak to me in their native language instead of mine?,"<p>I have this one friend who constantly speaks in English. I tried to speak to him in his language; sometimes he replies in that language and sometimes in English. I am an intermediate-level speaker in his language and would like to have more practice in using it.  </p>

<p>How can I get him to speak with me in his language without frustrating him?</p>
",5831,24-10-2017 14:23,Asking someone to use their native language without being rude,"<p>Sometimes, I find myself in a conversation with people who can't speak English (or some other language) with standard pronunciation. Of course, not everyone has good speaking skills to begin with, and I believe it's more of an issue with my hearing than everything else. Moreover, I don't want to discourage anyone from learning a new language by making remarks about their skills. </p>

<p>However, when I have a decent understanding of the interlocutor's native language, I feel like the conversation evolves more naturally if they use it.</p>

<p>For instance, I've just helped a French tourist get around my hometown. While I couldn't understand her strongly accented English, the conversation went smoothly as soon as she started speaking French to me. I can't speak French, so I just answered her questions in English, making it a bilingual conversation. Due to the circumstances - we were at the subway, plus she's a stranger I'm unlikely to ever see again -, I was able to say ""I'm sorry, but I cannot understand your English, can we try French, please?"", but this sounds like a rude way to start talking to people I must see on a daily basis. </p>

<p>In another example, one of my best friends' wife is Peruvian and I struggle to have a talk with her in any language other than Spanish. Having been living here for several years, she has a decent vocabulary and most people get along with her just fine (in fact, she's lovely). Yet, whenever we're talking using the local language, I seem to miss about 20% of what she's saying and I don't have the courage to tell her.</p>

<p><strong>How can I politely get someone to talk to me in an understandable manner, without making them feel like it's their fault somehow?</strong></p>

<p>I'm ok with little white lies, as long as it doesn't discourage them from keeping on trying. I do feel like this is more of an issue with me than the other person, but saying this out loud sounds like I'm just trying to call them out politely.</p>

How and when to best approach a stranger about a “wardrobe malfunction?”,"<p>So a “wardrobe malfunction” can basically mean someone’s fly being open or someone’s dress, skirt getting bunched up in a weird way in their underpants.</p>

<p>If I am dealing with friends, acquaintances, co-workers or someone I have some basic familiarity with, I can easily just come up to them and say, “Hey! I think you should check your this/that/other…”</p>

<p>But what about complete strangers regardless of gender, age orientation or ability? My general rule of thumb has been to approach a stranger based on severity and awareness… Will be honest, I borderline on gender-bias when this happens since I think a man with an open zipper is not as bad/embarrassing as a woman who inadvertently has their skirt or dress burned up in the back of their underpants.</p>

<p>I am located in a major city in the northeast part of the U.S. if to add context.</p>
",5661,19-10-2017 20:31,"Is it appropriate to tell someone of the opposite gender ""your fly is down""?","<p>I just spent 15 minutes talking in the hallway at work with a male coworker (I'm female) about the recent arrival of their second child. I spent the last five minutes of that chat trying to decide if I should tell him his zipper was unzipped.</p>

<p>I don't generally have an issue telling other women this and I have no problems telling my spouse XYZPDQ (examine your zipper pretty darn quick) but I'm tentative about this with a friend/coworker (technically, he's my husband's coworker, but we all work in the same office) because it's awkward and (sort of) implies that you were looking in that general direction. It's doubly awkward because we were in a public space where others could overhear us.</p>

<p>In this situation (different genders, public space, coworkers/friends) is it appropriate to tell someone that their fly is down and (if so) how should I do this such that it will minimize the awkwardness of the statement? He's a nice guy and I'd certainly not want to make him feel uncomfortable around me.</p>

How to help my girlfriend with her lack of self-confidence?,"<p>My girlfriend and I are together for little over a year now. She has big problems with self-esteem and little to no sense of self-worth, which I think is at least in part due to parental abuse and -abandonment.</p>

<p>No matter how often I assure her that I love her and everything about her (her personality, her looks, her intellect, our shared interests, etc.), she quickly deflects it as ""I am only saiyng that to cheer her up"".</p>

<p>I don't want to keep any secrets from her, so if she asks me about my ex-girlfriend, I always tell the truth to the best of my ability. (My first relationship ended almost a decade ago, so some details are hard to recall, especially since those memories mostly weren't really pleasant). My problem is just, she gets extremely sad and insecure over the most minute details.</p>

<p><strong>An example:</strong> She asks me questions like ""What hair colour did your ex have?"" and when I tell her she had brown hair, she gets depressed and tells me she finds her black hair ugly. I tell her that I find her black hair absolutely beautiful and that it's my favourite hair colour - which is true - but she just dismisses it as something I say just to cheer her up.</p>

<p>I don't want to lie to her and pretend my past doesn't exist.</p>

<p>Worst of all, after she had calmed herself, she usually falls into an episode of self-loathing, where she apologizes profusely, telling me that she is sorry for being such a burden to me. When I tell her that it is fine, that I am not upset, and that I love her more and more every day, she just seems to ignore that.</p>

<p>Is there anything I can do to help her feel more confident about herself and our relationship? Any help would be appreciated!</p>
",4633,26-09-2017 20:06,How to help my girlfriend get her confidence back?,"<p>My girlfriend and I have been dating for a little over a year now, and while I consider her to be an amazing person, she has an extremely low opinion of herself, calling herself ""worthless"" or the likes.</p>

<p>I think it's important here to give a little context to the situation :</p>

<p><strong>What happened:</strong></p>

<p>Since middle school, she has been the target of severe bullying. To give a few examples of how severe it was, she's got a few scars on both of her forearms which were inflicted upon her by her bullies. As well as several burns. There have also been cases of her getting locked up (purposefully) in a cellar for literal hours. But what seems to have hurt her the most was the verbal abuse she had to deal with for those years.</p>

<p>As one might expect, she's been subject to depression, as well as self-harming, and she even attempted suicide once, but with professional help, it seems like it's behind her now.</p>

<p>But in her last year of High School, things got a lot worse for her, and the bullying became much, much worse. Which led to her becoming a shut-in.</p>

<p><strong>The situation now:</strong></p>

<p>With the help of a professional we were able to convince her to get out of the house at least once or twice a week (though she won't go alone, or for more that or 2 hours). Due to her hometown being fairly small, we would happen to stumble upon some of her old bullies every now and then. While they would usually not do anything if she is not alone, there have been instances of them trying to start something, so we decided to move out. </p>

<p>Now that we moved out, she is able to get outside much more often than before, and for longer periods, too, so all in all, it's much better than before.</p>

<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>

<p>Though her situation is much better now than before, she now has an extremely low self-esteem. While we are seeing a professional to help her with that, I would like to be able to help her gain some confidence back.</p>

<p><strong>My Question:</strong></p>

<p>What should I do, as a boyfriend, to help her get some confidence back? </p>

"How to safely phrase ""I wish to broaden my cultural horizons while taking an interest in yours.""","<p>There seems to be a great deal of misunderstanding about the following exchange between two people, the first wishes to broaden their cultural horizons while expressing an interest in the acquaintance's heritage.</p>

<p>This genuine interest; however, is betrayed by the imprecision of the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Outgoing</strong>: ""Hi! I'm ______, nice to meet you.""<br>
  <strong>Shy</strong>: ""Hi, nice to meet you too. I'm ________.""<br>
  <strong>Outgoing</strong>: ""Oh yeah, so where are you from?""<br>
  <strong>Shy</strong>: ""CurrentCity""<br>
  <strong>Outgoing</strong>: ""Oh."" (surprised the listener failed to understand)<br>
   ""I mean, where are you <em>originally</em> from?""<br>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The intent of re-asking the question is to say:</p>

<p>I'm asking based on your facial features, style of dress, or manner of speech; i.e. noticeably different, or similar to my own. ""Outgoing"" could have said:        </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there any countries, languages, customs, or styles of fashion or music or literature, that I might already have a keen interest in, that you have been influenced by or possibly have insider information about, that could lead to many lively and fulfilling conversations between the two of us?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would like to know if there is a simpler way of expressing the above: a clear way to express the full intent behind the question in a way that is both unambiguous and conversational. In such a way that the listener may respond: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Outgoing</strong>: ""Oh yeah, so where are you from?""<br>
  <strong>Shy</strong>: ""CurrentCity""<br>
  <strong>Outgoing</strong>: ""Me too! I just spent all week talking about CurrentCity though.<br>
  <strong>Shy</strong>: ""Well I (grew up in/just visited/did my residency) in Taipei...""    </p>

",3497,07-09-2017 18:53,Is it rude to ask someone where they are from originally?,"<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This question is different from <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/1539/is-it-rude-to-ask-tourists-where-they-are-from"">this excellent one</a>, since it is not about tourists. The differences will become clear later on, I hope.</p>
<p>I will, as usual, use fake names (Alice and Eve this time) and also name places (L. A. and New York), that do not need to coincide with the actual cities.</p>
<p>Alice is a US citizen, born and raised in the US. Her name is very uncommon, though. And her appearance doesn't match &quot;Average Jane's&quot; entirely.</p>
<p>Eve is nice and open-minded and looks more like your &quot;Average Jane&quot;.</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>I met with Alice and Eve, who didn't know each other before, in New York. I do know both, so I was the common denominator. It was nothing formal, just a nice evening at home.</p>
<p>After some introduction, like where I met Alice and Eve for the first time, a dialogue between Eve and Alice ensued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eve: Where are you from?</p>
<p>Alice: I'm from Los Angeles. My whole family lives there.</p>
<p>Eve: I love L. A.! But where are you from originally?</p>
<p>Alice: <em>(short pause)</em> Also L. A., I was born there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eve didn't seem to notice anything, and they went on. After hearing the question, I looked at Alice to see her reaction, and, although it was subtle, I do think that she wasn't glad about &quot;Where are you from originally?&quot;. Also, she seemed a bit more reserved afterwards. On a sidenote, Eve also told a lot about herself, it was not a one-sided questioning.</p>
<p>At the end, Eve said, that it was a nice evening and Alice was great, but maybe a bit distanced. I said, that I felt that question to have been rude. She disagreed, noting how I was being over-sensitive and how she loves foreign cultures. She just had wanted to get to know her better and was genuinely interested.</p>
<p>Now, Alice was polite and said that she had enjoyed the evening and how Eve was a nice person. She didn't complain, but I doubt she would have, fearing it may hurt me. I also didn't want to pressure her for the sake of my couriosity. So I just gave her the chance to voice her opinion, in case she wanted to, and decided to ask the community here.</p>
<h2>Question</h2>
<p>Is it rude to ask someone <strong>&quot;Where are you from originally?&quot;</strong>. Is there maybe a better way to phrase the question?</p>
<p>Please note, that this is not about proving me and my reasoning right. I'm genuinely interested in how such a question is perceived. And this is, in contrast to the other question, not about tourists or the like. While Eve didn't know Alice, there was no reason to suggest, that she was, e. g., a tourist. And there may be cases, where just the name is very uncommon.</p>

How do I make people stop seeing me as a child?,"<p>English is not my mother tongue so please be indulgent.</p>

<p>In my family, we are pretty close to each other. I mean, when I say ""family"", it includes aunts, uncles and cousins. With my big sister, we grew up with my cousins and one of our aunts. They were all born in the mid and late 1980s. And here I come, born in 1993.</p>

<p>As I am the youngest and the shiest, I was quite often left aside and couldn't build any relationship with them. Plus, I had and still have a rather difficult relationship with my sister.</p>

<p>When I was 20, the situation didn't change. They never shared anything with me. They never asked me to go out with them. It's not like they are much older than me. Even when they are talking, when I'm here, no one talks to me. I know I should try to fit in, but whenever I try to give my opinion, it's like I shouldn't, because ""I don't know what I'm talking about."" They don't even listen to what I have to say. </p>

<p>Even now, no one thinks I can think for myself and make my own decisions because everyone sees me as a child who is influenced by everything and everyone. </p>

<p>I have lived by myself and had a job for about two years. And most of them don't. I am not saying that having or not having a job justifies whether you are mature or not. I am just saying that even if I proved that I'm responsible, they do not see me as an adult.</p>
